The Epistle of Paul to the Galatians


Chapter 1


1 Paul, an apostle—not sent from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—  
2 and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:


3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,  
4 who gave himself for our sins in order to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,  
5 to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.


6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—  
7 not that there is another gospel, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.  
8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim a gospel to you contrary to the one we proclaimed to you, let him be accursed.  
9 As we have said before, so now I say again: if anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be accursed.


10 For am I now seeking the approval of men or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.


11 For I make known to you, brothers, that the gospel proclaimed by me is not according to man.  
12 For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.


13 For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I was persecuting the church of God beyond measure and trying to destroy it.  
14 And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation, being far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.  
15 But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace, was pleased  
16 to reveal his Son in me so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,  
17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.


18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him for fifteen days.  
19 And I saw none of the other apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.  
20 (In what I am writing to you, behold, before God, I am not lying.)  
21 Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.  
22 I was still personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.  
23 They only kept hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.”  
24 And they glorified God because of me.




Chapter 2


1 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.  
2 I went up because of a revelation and laid out before them the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles—but privately to those of repute—lest I should be running, or had run, in vain.  
3 But even Titus, who was with me, though he is a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised.  
4 Yet because of the false brothers secretly brought in—who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us—  
5 we did not yield in submission to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.  
6 But from those who were considered to be something—what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality—those men added nothing to me.  
7 On the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised—  
8 for the one who worked through Peter for his apostleship to the circumcised also worked through me for the Gentiles—  
9 and recognizing the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.  
10 They only asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do.


11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.  
12 For before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those from the circumcision.  
13 And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.  
14 But when I saw that they were not walking uprightly in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, “If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?”


15 We are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners,  
16 yet we know that a man is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. Even we have believed in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no man will be justified.  
17 But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also have been found sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not!  
18 For if I rebuild the very things I tore down, I demonstrate myself to be a transgressor.  
19 For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God.  
20 I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.  
21 I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for nothing.




Chapter 3


1 You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified.
2 I only want to learn this from you: did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?
3 Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?
4 Have you suffered so much for nothing—if indeed it was for nothing?
5 So then, does the one who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?


6 Just as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness,
7 you must understand, then, that those who are of faith—these are the sons of Abraham.
8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the gospel in advance to Abraham: “In you shall all the nations be blessed.”
9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.


10 For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things written in the book of the law, to do them.”
11 Now it is evident that no man is justified before God by the law, because “The righteous shall live by faith.”
12 But the law is not of faith; rather, “The one who does them shall live by them.”
13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”—
14 so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.


15 Brothers, I speak according to human terms: even with a man-made covenant, once it has been ratified, no one cancels or adds to it.
16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. It does not say, “and to seeds,” as of many, but as of one: “and to your seed,” who is Christ.
17 What I am saying is this: the law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not nullify a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void.
18 For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God granted it to Abraham through a promise.


19 Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise had been made; and it was administered through angels by the hand of a mediator.
20 Now a mediator is not for one party only, but God is one.
21 Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been by the law.
22 But the Scripture confined all under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.


23 But before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed.
24 So then, the law was our guardian until Christ, so that we might be justified by faith.
25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,
26 for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
29 And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.




Chapter 4


1 I say that as long as the heir is a child, he differs in no way from a slave, though he is master of all.  
2 But he is under guardians and stewards until the time set by the father.  
3 So also we, when we were children, were enslaved under the elemental principles of the world.  
4 But when the fullness of time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,  
5 to redeem those under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.  
6 And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!”  
7 So then, you are no longer a slave but a son; and if a son, then also an heir through God.


8 However, formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those who by nature are not gods.  
9 But now that you have come to know God—or rather, to be known by God—how is it that you are turning back again to the weak and worthless elemental principles, to which you want to be enslaved all over again?  
10 You observe days and months and seasons and years.  
11 I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.


12 I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong.  
13 You know that it was because of a weakness of the flesh that I preached the gospel to you the first time.  
14 And though my flesh was a trial to you, you did not despise or reject me, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.  
15 What then became of your blessedness? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.  
16 So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?


17 They are zealous for you, but not for good. Rather, they want to shut you out, so that you might be zealous for them.  
18 Now it is good to be zealous for good at all times—not only when I am present with you—  
19 my children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you.  
20 I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.


21 Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?  
22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and one by the free woman.  
23 But the one by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, while the one by the free woman was through promise.  
24 These things are spoken allegorically: for these women are two covenants—one from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.  
25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.  
26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.  
27 For it is written,


“Rejoice, O barren woman who does not bear;  
break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor;  
for the children of the desolate woman are more than of her who has a husband.”


28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.  
29 But just as at that time the one born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.  
30 But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.”  
31 So then, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman.




Chapter 5


1 Christ has set us free so we could have freedom; stand firm, then, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.


2 Listen! I, Paul, tell you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.  
3 I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to keep the entire law.  
4 You who seek to be justified by the law have been cut off from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.  
5 For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly await the hope of righteousness.  
6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but only faith working through love.


7 You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?  
8 This persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.  
9 A little leaven leavens the whole batch.  
10 I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view; but the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he may be.  
11 But as for me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.  
12 I wish those who are unsettling you would go so far as to emasculate themselves!


13 For you were called to freedom, brothers; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love.  
14 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”  
15 But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.


16 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.  
17 For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. These are opposed to each other, so that you do not do whatever you want.  
18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.


19 Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery,  
20 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissension, factions,  
21 envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.


22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,  
23 gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.  
24 Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.


25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit.  
26 Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.




Chapter 6


1 Brothers, even if a man is caught in some transgression, you who are spiritual should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, watching yourself lest you too be tempted.  
2 Bear one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.  
3 For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.  
4 But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself alone and not in comparison to someone else.  
5 For each man will bear his own load.  


6 Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches.  
7 Do not be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, is what he will also reap.  
8 For the one who sows to his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.  
9 And let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not give up.  
10 So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, and especially to those of the household of the faith.  


11 See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.  
12 Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh are the ones compelling you to be circumcised—only so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.  
13 For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.  
14 But may it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.  
15 For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but a new creation.  
16 And as many as walk by this rule—peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.  


17 From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.  
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
