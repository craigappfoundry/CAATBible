The Lamentations of Ezekiel


Chapter 1


1 How lonely sits the city that was full of people!
She has become like a widow, she who was great among the nations!
She who was a princess among the provinces has become a slave.


2 She weeps bitterly in the night,
and her tears are on her cheeks;
among all her lovers there is none to comfort her.
All her friends have dealt treacherously with her;
they have become her enemies.


3 Judah has gone into exile under affliction
and under harsh servitude;
she dwells among the nations,
but finds no rest.
All her pursuers have overtaken her
in the midst of distress.


4 The roads of Zion mourn,
because none come to the appointed feasts;
all her gates are desolate,
her priests groan,
her virgins grieve,
and she herself is bitter.


5 Her adversaries have become her masters,
her enemies prosper,
for the LORD has afflicted her
for the multitude of her transgressions;
her little ones have gone away captive
before the foe.


6 From the daughter of Zion
all her splendor has departed.
Her princes have become like deer
that find no pasture;
they fled without strength
before the pursuer.


7 In the days of her affliction and wandering,
Jerusalem remembers all her precious things
that were from the days of old.
When her people fell into the hand of the enemy
and no one helped her,
the adversaries saw her and mocked
at her downfall.


8 Jerusalem has grievously sinned;
therefore she has become unclean.
All who honored her despise her,
because they have seen her nakedness;
she herself groans
and turns away.


9 Her uncleanness was in her skirts;
she did not consider her latter end.
Therefore she has fallen astonishingly;
she has no comforter.
“See, O LORD, my affliction,
for the enemy has magnified himself.”


10 The adversary has stretched out his hand
over all her precious things;
for she has seen the nations
enter her sanctuary,
those whom You commanded
that they should not enter Your assembly.


11 All her people groan
as they search for bread;
they have given their precious things for food
to restore their lives.
“See, O LORD, and look,
for I am despised.”


12 “Is it nothing to you, all who pass by?
Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow,
which has been brought upon me,
which the LORD inflicted
in the day of His fierce anger.


13 From on high He sent fire into my bones,
and it prevailed against them;
He has spread a net for my feet,
He has turned me back;
He has made me desolate
and faint all the day long.


14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand;
they are knit together;
they have come up upon my neck;
He has made my strength fail.
The Lord has given me into the hands
of those whom I cannot withstand.


15 The Lord has rejected
all my mighty men in my midst;
He has called an assembly against me
to crush my young men.
The Lord has trodden as in a winepress
the virgin daughter of Judah.


16 For these things I weep;
my eyes flow with tears,
for a comforter is far from me,
one to restore my life.
My children are desolate,
for the enemy has prevailed.”


17 Zion stretches out her hands,
but there is no one to comfort her;
the LORD has commanded against Jacob
that his neighbors should be his adversaries;
Jerusalem has become
an unclean thing among them.


18 “The LORD is righteous,
for I have rebelled against His commandment.
Hear, all peoples, and see my sorrow;
my virgins and my young men
have gone into captivity.


19 I called to my lovers,
but they deceived me;
my priests and my elders perished in the city
while they sought food for themselves
to restore their lives.


20 See, O LORD, for I am in distress;
my spirit is greatly troubled;
my heart is overturned within me,
for I have been very rebellious.
In the street the sword bereaves;
in the house it is like death.


21 They have heard that I sigh;
there is none to comfort me.
All my enemies have heard of my trouble;
they are glad that You have done it.
Bring the day that You have proclaimed,
that they may become like me.


22 Let all their wickedness come before You,
and deal with them as You have dealt with me
because of all my transgressions;
for my sighs are many,
and my heart is faint.”




Chapter 2


1 How the Lord in His anger
has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud!
He has cast down from heaven to earth
the splendor of Israel,
and has not remembered His footstool
in the day of His anger.


2 The Lord has swallowed up without mercy
all the habitations of Jacob;
He has torn down in His wrath the strongholds
of the daughter of Judah;
He has brought them down to the ground;
He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.


3 In fierce anger He has cut off
every horn of Israel;
He has withdrawn His right hand
from before the enemy;
He has burned against Jacob like a flaming fire
consuming all around.


4 He has bent His bow like an enemy;
He has set His right hand like an adversary
and slain all that were pleasant to the eye;
in the tent of the daughter of Zion
He has poured out His fury like fire.


5 The Lord has become like an enemy;
He has swallowed up Israel;
He has swallowed up all her palaces;
He has destroyed her strongholds,
and multiplied in the daughter of Judah
mourning and lamentation.


6 He has violently treated His tabernacle like a garden hut;
He has destroyed His appointed meeting place.
The LORD has caused the appointed feast and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion,
and in the indignation of His anger has despised king and priest.


7 The Lord has rejected His altar;
He has abandoned His sanctuary;
He has delivered into the hand of the enemy
the walls of her palaces.
They have raised a cry in the house of the LORD
as on the day of an appointed feast.


8 The LORD determined to destroy
the wall of the daughter of Zion;
He stretched out the measuring line;
He did not withdraw His hand from destroying;
He made rampart and wall lament;
they languish together.


9 Her gates have sunk into the ground;
He has destroyed and broken her bars;
her king and her princes are among the nations;
the law is no more,
and her prophets find no vision from the LORD.


10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground and keep silence;
they have thrown dust on their heads;
they have girded themselves with sackcloth;
the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.


11 My eyes fail because of tears,
my spirit is troubled;
my heart is poured out on the ground
because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,
when the little ones and infants faint
in the streets of the city.


12 They say to their mothers,
“Where is grain and wine?”
as they faint like wounded men
in the streets of the city,
as their life is poured out
on their mothers’ bosom.


13 What can I say for you?
What can I compare to you, O daughter of Jerusalem?
What can I liken to you that I may comfort you,
O virgin daughter of Zion?
For your ruin is vast as the sea;
who can heal you?


14 Your prophets have seen for you
vain and foolish things;
they have not exposed your iniquity
to restore your fortunes,
but have seen for you oracles
of falsehood and delusion.


15 All who pass along the way clap their hands at you;
they hiss and shake their heads
at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,
“Is this the city that was called
the perfection of beauty,
the joy of the whole earth?”


16 All your enemies open their mouths wide against you;
they hiss and gnash their teeth;
they say,
“We have swallowed her up!
Surely this is the day we have waited for;
we have found it, we have seen it.”


17 The LORD has done what He purposed;
He has carried out His word
which He commanded from days of old;
He has thrown down without pity
and has caused the enemy to rejoice over you;
He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.


18 Their heart cried out to the Lord,
“O wall of the daughter of Zion,
let tears run down like a river day and night;
give yourself no relief;
let not the apple of your eye cease.”


19 “Arise, cry out in the night
at the beginning of the watches;
pour out your heart like water
before the face of the Lord;
lift up your hands toward Him
for the life of your little ones,
who faint for hunger
at the head of every street.”


20 “Look, O LORD, and consider
to whom You have done this!
Should women eat the fruit of their womb,
the children they have cared for?
Should priest and prophet be slain
in the sanctuary of the Lord?”


21 The young and the old
lie on the ground in the streets;
my virgins and my young men
have fallen by the sword;
You have slain them in the day of Your anger;
You have slaughtered without pity.


22 You have summoned as on an appointed day
my terrors on every side,
and there was no one who escaped or survived
in the day of the LORD’s anger;
those whom I have cared for and raised,
my enemy has destroyed.




Chapter 3

1 I am the man who has seen affliction
by the rod of His wrath.
2 He has driven me and brought me
into darkness and not light.
3 Surely against me He turns His hand
again and again all the day.


4 He has worn away my flesh and my skin;
He has broken my bones.
5 He has besieged me and surrounded me
with bitterness and hardship.
6 He has made me dwell in dark places
like those long dead.


7 He has walled me in so I cannot escape;
He has made my chains heavy.
8 Even when I cry out and call for help,
He shuts out my prayer.
9 He has blocked my ways with hewn stone;
He has made my paths crooked.


10 He is to me like a bear lying in wait,
like a lion in hiding.
11 He has turned aside my ways and torn me in pieces;
He has made me desolate.
12 He has bent His bow and set me
as the target for His arrow.


13 He has caused the arrows of His quiver
to pierce my inward parts.
14 I have become the laughingstock of all my people,
their song all the day.
15 He has filled me with bitterness,
He has made me drunk with wormwood.


16 He has broken my teeth with gravel;
He has covered me with ashes.
17 My soul has been removed from peace;
I have forgotten what prosperity is.
18 So I said, “My strength is gone,
and my hope from the LORD.”


19 Remember my affliction and my wandering,
the wormwood and the gall.
20 My soul continually remembers
and is bowed down within me.
21 Yet this I call to mind,
and therefore I have hope:


22 The LORD’s loyal love never ceases;
His compassions never fail.
23 They are new every morning;
great is Your faithfulness.
24 “The LORD is my portion,” says my soul,
“therefore I will hope in Him.”


25 The LORD is good to those who wait for Him,
to the soul who seeks Him.
26 It is good that one should wait quietly
for the salvation of the LORD.
27 It is good for a man
to bear the yoke in his youth.


28 Let him sit alone and be silent,
because He has laid it on him.
29 Let him put his mouth in the dust—
perhaps there is hope.
30 Let him give his cheek to the one who strikes him;
let him be filled with reproach.


31 For the Lord will not
reject forever.
32 Though He causes grief, He will have compassion
according to the abundance of His steadfast love.
33 For He does not willingly afflict
or grieve the sons of man.


34 To crush underfoot
all the prisoners of the earth,
35 to deny a man justice
in the presence of the Most High,
36 to subvert a man in his cause—
the Lord does not approve.


37 Who is there who speaks and it happens,
unless the Lord has commanded it?
38 Is it not from the mouth of the Most High
that both calamities and blessings come?
39 Why should any living man comlain,
a man for the punishment of his sins?


40 Let us test and examine our ways,
and return to the LORD.
41 Let us lift up our hearts and hands
to God in heaven:
42 “We have transgressed and rebelled,
and You have not pardoned.


43 You have wrapped Yourself in anger and pursued us;
You have slain without pity.
44 You have covered Yourself with a cloud
so that no prayer can pass through.
45 You have made us scum and refuse
among the nations.


46 All our enemies have opened their mouths
against us.
47 Terror and pitfall have come upon us,
devastation and destruction.
48 My eyes flow with streams of tears
for the destruction of the daughter of my people.


49 My eyes flow unceasingly,
without relief,
50 until the LORD looks down
and sees from heaven.
51 My eyes bring pain to my soul
because of all the daughters of my city.”


52 My enemies without cause
hunted me down like a bird.
53 They silenced my life in the pit
and cast stones on me.
54 Waters flowed over my head;
I said, “I am cut off.”


55 I called on Your name, O LORD,
from the lowest pit.
56 You heard my voice:
“Do not close Your ear to my cry for relief,
to my cry for help.”
57 You drew near when I called on You;
You said, “Do not fear.”


58 You have pleaded the causes of my soul, O Lord;
You have redeemed my life.
59 You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me;
judge my cause.
60 You have seen all their vengeance,
all their plots against me.


61 You have heard their reproach, O LORD,
all their schemes against me,
62 the lips of my enemies and their whispering
are against me all day long.
63 Look at their sitting down and their rising up;
I am their song.


64 You will repay them, O LORD,
according to the work of their hands.
65 You will give them hardness of heart;
Your curse will be on them.
66 You will pursue them in anger and destroy them
from under the heavens of the LORD.



Chapter 4


1 How the gold has grown dim,
the fine gold changed!
The sacred stones lie scattered
at every street corner.


2 The precious sons of Zion,
worth their weight in pure gold—
how they are reckoned as clay jars,
the work of a potter’s hands!


3 Even jackals offer the breast
to nurse their young,
but the daughter of my people has become cruel,
like ostriches in the wilderness.


4 The tongue of the nursing infant
sticks to its palate for thirst;
the children beg for bread,
but no one breaks it for them.


5 Those who once feasted on delicacies
lie dying in the streets;
those who were brought up in scarlet
now embrace ash heaps.


6 The guilt of the daughter of my people
is greater than the sin of Sodom,
which was overthrown in a moment,
and no hands were laid on her.


7 Her princes were purer than snow,
whiter than milk;
their bodies were more ruddy than coral,
their form like sapphire.


8 Now their appearance is darker than soot;
they are not recognized in the streets.
Their skin has shriveled on their bones;
it has become dry as wood.


9 Those slain by the sword
were better off than those slain by hunger,
who waste away,
pierced through for lack of the fruits of the field.


10 The hands of compassionate women
have boiled their own children;
they became their food
in the destruction of the daughter of my people.


11 The LORD has spent His fury;
He has poured out His fierce anger.
He kindled a fire in Zion,
and it consumed her foundations.


12 The kings of the earth did not believe,
nor any of the inhabitants of the world,
that foe or enemy could enter
the gates of Jerusalem.


13 It was because of the sins of her prophets
and the iniquities of her priests,
who shed in her midst
the blood of the righteous.


14 They wandered, blind, through the streets,
defiled with blood,
so that none could touch
their garments.


15 “Away! Unclean!” they cried to them.
“Away! Away! Do not touch!”
So they fled and wandered;
it was said among the nations,
“They shall dwell here no longer.”


16 The LORD Himself has scattered them;
He no longer regards them.
They did not honor the priests;
they showed no favor to the elders.


17 Still our eyes failed,
watching vainly for help.
We watched and watched
for a nation that could not save.


18 They hunted our steps
so that we could not walk in our streets.
Our end drew near; our days were finished,
for our end had come.


19 Our pursuers were swifter
than the eagles of the sky.
They chased us on the mountains;
they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.


20 The breath of our nostrils,
the LORD’s anointed,
was captured in their pits—
he of whom we said,
“Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.”


21 Rejoice and be glad,
O daughter of Edom,
you who dwell in the land of Uz!
But to you also the cup shall pass;
you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.


22 The punishment of your iniquity,
O daughter of Zion, is accomplished;
He will no longer exile you.
But He will punish your iniquity,
O daughter of Edom;
He will expose your sins.




Chapter 5


1 Remember, O LORD, what has come upon us;
look and see our disgrace.
2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
our houses to foreigners.
3 We have become orphans, fatherless;
our mothers are like widows.
4 We must pay for the water we drink;
our wood comes at a price.
5 We are pursued with a yoke on our necks;
we are weary, we find no rest.
6 We have given our hand to Egypt
and to Assyria, to get enough bread.
7 Our fathers sinned and are no more,
but we bear their iniquities.
8 Servants rule over us;
there is none to deliver us from their hand.
9 We get our bread at the peril of our lives
because of the sword in the wilderness.
10 Our skin burns like an oven,
from the scorching heat of famine.
11 They ravished the women in Zion,
the virgins in the towns of Judah.
12 Princes were hung up by their hands;
no respect was shown to the elders.
13 Young men were made to grind at the mill,
and boys staggered under loads of wood.
14 The elders have left the gate,
the young men their music.
15 The joy of our hearts has ceased;
our dance has turned into mourning.
16 The crown has fallen from our head;
woe to us, for we have sinned!
17 Because of this our heart is faint;
because of these things our eyes grow dim,
18 because Mount Zion lies desolate;
foxes prowl over it.
19 You, O LORD, reign forever;
Your throne endures from generation to generation.
20 Why do You forget us forever,
why do You forsake us so long?
21 Restore us to Yourself, O LORD, that we may return;
renew our days as of old—
22 unless You have utterly rejected us,
and are exceedingly angry with us.
