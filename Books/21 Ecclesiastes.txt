Ecclesiastes


Chapter 1


1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
2 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.
3 What profit does man have in all his labor which he does under the sun?


4 A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth stands forever.
5 The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises.
6 The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. Round and round goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns.
7 All the rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers go, there they return again.
8 All things are wearisome—man cannot express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.


9 What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.
10 Is there anything of which one might say, “See, this is new”? It has already been done in the ages which passed before us.
11 There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be remembrance of later things that are to come among those who will come after.


12 I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
13 And I gave my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven. It is a grievous task God has given to the sons of man to be afflicted with.
14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and I see that all is vanity and a chasing after the wind.
15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.


16 I said in my heart, “Behold, I have grown great and have become wise more than all who were before me over Jerusalem, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”
17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly—I perceived that this also is a chasing after wind.
18 For in much wisdom is much grief, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.




Chapter 2


1 I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.” But I saw that this also was vanity.
2 I said of laughter, “It is madness,” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?”
3 I searched with my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine—my heart still guiding me with wisdom—and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the sons of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.


4 I undertook great works. I built houses for myself. I planted vineyards for myself.
5 I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
6 I made myself pools of water from which to water a forest of growing trees.
7 I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, more than all who were before me in Jerusalem.
8 I also gathered for myself silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I got for myself male singers and female singers, and the delights of the sons of man—many concubines.


9 So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem, and still my wisdom remained with me.
10 And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my reward for all my toil.
11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done and the labor I had spent in doing it, and I saw that all was vanity and a chasing after the wind, and that there was no profit under the sun.


12 Then I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.
13 Then I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.
14 The wise man has eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. Yet I perceived that the same fate happens to all of them.
15 Then I said in my heart, “What happens to the fool will happen to me too. Why, then, have I been excessively wise?” And I said in my heart, “This also is vanity.”
16 For of the wise, as of the fool, there is no lasting remembrance, since in the days to come all will be forgotten. And how the wise man dies just like the fool!
17 So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all is vanity and a chasing after the wind.


18 And I hated all of the work at which I had labored under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will come after me.
19 And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the works in which I have labored and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
20 So I turned about and gave up my heart to despair over all the works in which I had labored under the sun.
21 For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom and knowledge and skill, yet he must leave it as an inheritance to one who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.


22 For what has man from all his labor and from the striving of his heart with which he labors under the sun?
23 For all his days are full of pain, and his occupation is grief. Even at night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.


24 There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and find enjoyment in his labor. This also, I have seen, is from the hand of God.
25 For who can eat and who can have enjoyment apart from Him?
26 For to the man who pleases Him, God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner He gives the task of gathering and collecting, only to give it to the one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after the wind.




Chapter 3


1 For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:
2 a time to be born and a time to die;
a time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted;
3 a time to kill and a time to heal;
a time to break down and a time to build up;
4 a time to weep and a time to laugh;
a time to mourn and a time to dance;
5 a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together;
a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;
6 a time to seek and a time to lose;
a time to keep and a time to cast away;
7 a time to tear and a time to sew;
a time to keep silent and a time to speak;
8 a time to love and a time to hate;
a time for war and a time for peace.


9 What gain does the worker have from his toil?
10 I have seen the task that God has given to the sons of man to be afflicted with.
11 He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out what God has done from beginning to end.


12 I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good as long as they live.
13 And also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor—this is the gift of God.


14 I know that whatever God does shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken from it. God has done it, so that men should fear before Him.
15 That which is has already been, and what is to be has already been, and God seeks what is pursued.


16 Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, wickedness was there, and in the place of righteousness, wickedness was there.
17 I said in my heart, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work.”


18 I said in my heart concerning the sons of man, “God is testing them, that they may see that they themselves are but beasts.”
19 For what happens to the sons of man and what happens to the beast is the same. As the one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beast, for all is vanity.
20 All go to one place. All are from the dust, and all return to the dust.
21 Who knows whether the breath of man goes upward and the breath of the beast goes downward to the earth?


22 So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for that is his portion. For who can bring him to see what will be after him?




Chapter 4


1 Then I turned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they have no comforter. On the side of their oppressors there is power, and they have no comforter.
2 And I praised the dead who had already died more than the living who are still alive.
3 But better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.


4 Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man's rivalry with his neighbor. This also is vanity and a chasing after the wind.
5 The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.
6 Better is a handful with rest than two handfuls with toil and a chasing after the wind.


7 I also saw this vanity under the sun:
8 There is one who is alone, without a companion—he has neither son nor brother—yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?” This also is vanity and an unhappy business.


9 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.
10 For if they fall, one will lift up his companion. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has no one to lift him up.
11 Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?
12 And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him—a threefold cord is not quickly broken.


13 Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to take advice.
14 For out of prison he came forth to reign, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.
15 Then I saw all the living who walk under the sun with a younger man, a usurper, trying to stand in his place.
16 There was no end to all the people, to all before them, yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after the wind.




Chapter 5


1 Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil.
2 Do not be quick with your mouth, and do not let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God. For God is in heaven and you are on earth; therefore let your words be few.
3 For a dream comes with much busyness, and a fool’s voice with many words.


4 When you vow a vow to God, do not delay to pay it, for He has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow.
5 It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.
6 Do not let your mouth lead your flesh into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?
7 For when dreams increase and there is an abundance of words, there is vanity. Better to fear God.


8 If you see the poor oppressed, while justice and righteousness are violated in the provinces, do not be astonished at the matter, for a high official is overseen by a still higher official, and there are yet higher ones over them.
9 But the profit of the land is in everything—a king is served by the field.


10 He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver, nor he who loves abundance with increase. This also is vanity.
11 When goods increase, they profit those who consume them. But what advantage is it to their owner except to look at them with his eyes?
12 Sweet is the sleep of the laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich does not let him sleep.


13 There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches kept by their owner to his harm,
14 and those riches perish in a bad venture. And he fathers a son, but he has nothing in his hand.
15 As he came from his mother’s womb, so shall he go again, as naked as he came. He shall take nothing from his labor that he can carry in his hand.
16 This also is a grievous evil: exactly as he came, so shall he go. And what profit does he have who toils for the wind?
17 Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness, with great vexation, sickness, and anger.


18 What I have seen to be good and fitting, is for a man to eat and drink and to enjoy the good in all his labor in which he toils under the sun during the few days of his life that God has given him—for this is his portion.
19 Moreover, everyone to whom God has given riches and wealth and the power to enjoy them, and to take his portion and rejoice in his labor—this is a gift of God.
20 For he will not often remember the days of his life, because God keeps him occupied with the joy of his heart.




Chapter 6


1 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavily on man:
2 a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God does not allow him to enjoy it. Instead, a stranger enjoys it. This is vanity; it is a grievous evil.


3 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better than he.
4 For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered.
5 Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds more rest than he.
6 Even if he lives a thousand years twice over, yet does not enjoy good—do not all go to the same place?


7 All the labor of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied.
8 For what advantage does the wise man have over the fool? And what does the poor man gain when he knows how to conduct himself properly before those who are alive?
9 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite. This also is vanity and a chasing after the wind.


10 Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to dispute with one stronger than him.
11 The more words, the more vanity, and what benefit does main gain from it?
12 For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell man what will come to be after him under the sun?




Chapter 7


1 A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of one’s death, than the day of one’s birth.
2 It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for this is how every man will end up, and then the living will take notice of their own mortality.
3 Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness of face the heart is made glad.
4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.


5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools.
6 For like the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of fools. This also is vanity.
7 Surely oppression makes a wise man foolish, and a bribe corrupts the heart.


8 Better is the end of a thing than its beginning, and the one who is patient in spirit is better than the one who is proud in spirit.
9 Do not be quick to become angry in your heart, for anger lodges in the heart of fools.
10 Do not say, “Why were the former days better than these?” For asking this does not come from wisdom.


11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance, and it is an advantage to those who see the sun.
12 For wisdom is a defense as money is a defense, but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.


13 Consider the work of God: who can make straight what He has made crooked?
14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.


15 I have seen everything in my vain days: there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness.
16 Do not be excessively righteous, and do not make yourself overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself?
17 Do not be excessively wicked, and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time?
18 It is good that you take hold of this, and also from that do not withhold your hand, for he who fears God will come forth from both of them.


19 Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.
20 Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.


21 Do not take to heart all the words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant cursing you.
22 For your heart knows that many times you yourself have cursed others.


23 All this I have tested by wisdom. I said, “I will be wise,” but it was far from me.
24 That which is far off and exceedingly deep—who can find it out?
25 I turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness of madness.


26 And I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her.
27 Look! This is what I have found, says the Preacher, adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things—
28 which my soul has still sought but not found: one man among a thousand I have found, but a woman among all these I have not found.
29 And yet, this alone I have found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.




Chapter 8


1 Who is like the wise man, and who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is softened.


2 I say: Keep the command of the king, and do so because of your oath to God.
3 Do not be hasty to leave his presence. Do not stand for an evil matter, for he does whatever he pleases.
4 For the word of the king is supreme, and who can say to him, “What are you doing?”
5 He who obeys a command will know no evil thing, and the wise heart will know the right time and the just way.
6 For there is a time and a method for every matter, even when a man's concerns lie heavy upon him.
7 For he does not know what will be, for who can tell him how it will be?
8 No man has power over the spirit to restrain the spirit, neither does he have power over the day of death. There is no discharge in war, and wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it.


9 All this I have seen, as I applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun, when man has power over another man to do him harm.


10 Then I saw the wicked buried—those who used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had done so. This also is vanity.
11 Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the sons of man is fully set in them to do evil.
12 Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his days, yet I know that it will be well with those who obey God, because they worship before Him.
13 But it will not be well with the wicked, and he shall not prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not worship before God.


14 There is a vanity that takes place on the earth: there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.


15 So I commended joy, for there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his labor through the days of his life that God gives him under the sun.


16 When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done on the earth—how neither day nor night do one's eyes see sleep—
17 then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, he cannot find it out.




Chapter 9


1 For I have taken all this to heart, even to examine all this: that the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hatred, man does not know; everything lies before Him.
2 It is the same for all: there is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked, for the good and for the clean and for the unclean, for the one who offers sacrifice and for the one who does not offer. As is the good man, so is the sinner; as is the one who swears an oath, so is the one who fears to swear.
3 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun: that one fate comes to all. Also the heart of the sons of man is full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.


4 But there is hope for one who is joined with all the living—for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
5 For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.
6 Their love and their hatred and their envy have already perished, and they no longer have a portion in anything that is done under the sun.


7 Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved your works.
8 Let your garments always be white, and do not let oil be lacking on your head.
9 Enjoy life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life that He has given you under the sun, all your vain days—for that is your portion in life and in your labor in which you toil under the sun.
10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom in the grave, where you are going.


11 Again I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the mighty, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to the knowledgeable, but time and chance happen to them all.
12 For man does not know his time. Like fish caught in an evil net, and like birds caught in a snare, so the sons of man are ensnared in a time of calamity when it suddenly falls upon them.


13 I also have seen this wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me:
14 There was a small city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and surrounded it and built great siegeworks against it.
15 But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he delivered the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
16 Then I said, “Wisdom is better than might,” yet the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heeded.
17 The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.




Chapter 10


1 Dead flies cause the perfumer’s ointment to stink and ferment; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
2 The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left.
3 Even when the fool walks on the road, his sense is lacking, and his words show everyone that he is a fool.


4 If the spirit of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place, for calmness lays great offenses to rest.
5 There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error that proceeds from a ruler:
6 folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place.
7 I have seen slaves on horses and princes walking like slaves on the ground.


8 He who digs a pit will fall into it, and he who breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent.
9 He who quarries stones may be hurt by them, and he who splits logs may be endangered by them.
10 If the iron is blunt and one does not sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one succeed.
11 If the serpent bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the charmer.


12 The words of a wise man’s mouth bring favor, but the lips of a fool consume him.
13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is wicked madness.
14 A fool multiplies words, though no man knows what will be—and who can tell him what will be after him?
15 The labor of fools wearies them, for they do not know the way to the city.


16 Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning!
17 Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes feast at the proper time—for strength and not for drunkenness!


18 Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through idle hands the house leaks.
19 Bread is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life, and money answers everything.
20 Even in your thoughts do not curse the king, and in your bedroom do not curse the rich, for a bird of the air may carry your voice, or some winged creature may report the matter.




Chapter 11


1 Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days.
2 Give a portion to seven, or even to eight, for you do not know what disaster may happen on the earth.


3 If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth; and if a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.
4 He who watches the wind will not sow, and he who looks at the clouds will not reap.
5 As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
6 In the morning sow your seed, and at evening do not withhold your hand, for you do not know which will prosper—this or that—or whether both alike will be good.


7 Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.
8 So if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all, but let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. All that comes is vanity.


9 Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.
10 Therefore remove vexation from your heart, and put away pain from your body, for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.




Chapter 12


1 Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;
2 before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;
3 in the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look through the windows are darkened;
4 and the doors on the street are shut, as the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low;
5 they are afraid also of what is high, and terrors are in the way; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along, and desire fails, because man is going to his eternal home, and the mourners go about in the street—
6 before the silver cord is snapped, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the cistern,
7 and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.


8 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity.


9 In addition to being wise, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge. He pondered and searched out and arranged many proverbs with care.
10 The Preacher sought to find words of delight, and uprightly he wrote words of truth.
11 The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings—they are given by one Shepherd.
12 My son, beware of anything beyond these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.


13 The end of the matter, all has been heard: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.
14 For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.
