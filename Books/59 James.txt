James


Chapter 1


1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: greetings.


2 Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials,
3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
4 And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.


5 But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him.
6 But let him ask in faith, without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.
7 For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord—
8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.


9 Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,
10 and the rich man in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away.
11 For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.


12 Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.
13 Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” for God is not tempted by evil, and He Himself tempts no one.
14 But each one is tempted when he is dragged away and enticed by his own desire.
15 Then desire, when it has conceived, gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death.


16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.
18 Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.


19 Know this, my beloved brothers: let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger,
20 for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
21 Therefore, put away all filthiness and the overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.


22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror.
24 For he looks at himself and goes away and immediately forgets what he was like.
25 But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and continues in it—not being a forgetful hearer but a doer who acts—he will be blessed in his doing.


26 If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this man’s religion is worthless.
27 Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.




Chapter 2


1 My brothers, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality.
2 For if a man enters your assembly with a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also enters,
3 and you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or “Sit down at my footstool,”
4 have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?


5 Listen, my beloved brothers: has not God chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that He has promised to those who love Him?
6 But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you and drag you into court?
7 Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?


8 If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.
9 But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.
11 For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.


12 So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.
13 For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.


14 What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
15 If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food,
16 and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things needed for the body, what good is that?
17 So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.


18 But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
19 You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!
20 Do you want to be shown, you foolish man, that faith apart from works is useless?


21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
22 You see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made complete.
23 And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness,” and he was called a friend of God.
24 You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.


25 And in the same way was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
26 For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.




Chapter 3


1 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.
2 For we all stumble in many ways. If a man does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body.
3 Now if we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well.
4 Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
5 So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.


See how great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!
6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the course of life, and it is set on fire in hell.
7 For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind,
8 but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
9 With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men who are made in the likeness of God.
10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.
11 Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?
12 Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt spring yield fresh water.


13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his works are done in the gentleness of wisdom.
14 But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.
15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every evil practice.
17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.
18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.




Chapter 4


1 What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?
2 You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and wage war. You do not have, because you do not ask.
3 You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.
4 You adulterous men, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
5 Or do you suppose that the Scripture says in vain, “He yearns jealously over the spirit that He has made to dwell in us”?
6 But He gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”


7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
8 Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
9 Be miserable and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.


11 Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
12 There is one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?


13 Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that city and spend a year there and trade and make a profit”—
14 yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
15 Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.”
16 But as it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.
17 So for the man who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.


Chapter 5


1 Come now, you rich, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you.
2 Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten.
3 Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasure in the last days.
4 Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.
5 You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
6 You have condemned and murdered the righteous man; he does not resist you.


7 Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early and late rain.
8 You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
9 Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.
10 As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
11 Behold, we consider those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord—how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.


12 But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath. Let your “yes” be yes and your “no” be no, so that you may not fall under judgment.


13 Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.
14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
15 And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man has great power as it is working.
17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
18 Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.


19 My brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back,
20 let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.
