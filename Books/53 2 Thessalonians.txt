The Second Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians


Chapter 1


1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2 Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.


3 We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, just as it is fitting, because your faith is growing abundantly and the love of each one of you for one another is increasing.
4 As a result, we ourselves boast about you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions you are enduring.
5 This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering.
6 For it is just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,
7 and to grant relief to you who are afflicted, along with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
8 inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
9 These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his strength,
10 when he comes to be glorified among his saints and to be marveled at among all who have believed—because our testimony to you was believed—on that day.


11 To this end also we pray for you always, that our God would make you worthy of the calling and fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power,
12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.




Chapter 2


1 Now we ask you, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,
2 that you not be quickly shaken in mind or troubled, either by a spirit or by a message or by a letter seeming to come from us, as though the day of the Lord has already come.
3 Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,
4 who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he sits in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.


5 Do you not remember that, while I was still with you, I used to tell you these things?
6 And you know what is restraining him now, so that he will be revealed in his own time.
7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains it will do so until he is taken out of the way.
8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of His coming.
9 The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power and false signs and wonders,
10 and with every wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved.
11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie,
12 in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness.


13 But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits for salvation, through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.
14 To this He called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
15 So then, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by our letter.


16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
17 comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word.




Chapter 3


1 Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run swiftly and be glorified, just as it was among you,  
2 and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men; for not all have faith.  
3 But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.  
4 And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we command.  
5 May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ.


6 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who lives irresponsibly and not according to the tradition that you received from us.  
7 For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we did not act irresponsibly among you,  
8 nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but with labor and toil we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you.  
9 It was not because we do not have the right, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate.  
10 For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: if anyone is not willing to work, do not allow him to eat.
11 For we hear that some among you are living irresponsibly, not working at all but meddling in the affairs of others.
12 Now such men we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they work quietly and eat their own bread.


13 But you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.
14 And if anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that man and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.
15 Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.


16 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with you all.


17 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
