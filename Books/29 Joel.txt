Joel


Chapter 1


1 The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel:
2 Hear this, O elders, and give ear, all you inhabitants of the land! Has anything like this happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers?
3 Tell your children about it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.
4 What the cutting locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; and what the swarming locust has left, the hopping locust has eaten; and what the hopping locust has left, the destroying locust has eaten.


5 Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you wine drinkers, because of the sweet wine, for it is cut off from your mouth.
6 For a nation has come up against My land, powerful and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it has the fangs of a lioness.
7 It has made My vine a waste and My fig tree a stump. It has stripped them bare and thrown them down; their branches are made white.
8 Lament like a virgin girded in sackcloth for the bridegroom of her youth.


9 The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off from the house of the LORD. The priests mourn, the ministers of the LORD.
10 The field is ruined; the ground mourns, for the grain is destroyed, the new wine has dried up, the oil fails.
11 Be ashamed, O tillers of the soil; wail, O vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley, because the harvest of the field has perished.
12 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree withers; pomegranate, palm, and apple— all the trees of the field are dried up. Surely joy has withered away from the sons of man.


13 Gird yourselves and lament, O priests; wail, O ministers of the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God, for the grain offering and the drink offering are withheld from the house of your God.
14 Consecrate a fast; call a solemn assembly. Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD.
15 Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is near, and as destruction from the Almighty it comes.
16 Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?


17 The seed shrivels under the clods; the storehouses are desolate; the granaries are broken down, because the grain has dried up.
18 How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are confused because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep suffer punishment.
19 To You, O LORD, I cry out, for fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flame has burned all the trees of the field.
20 Even the beasts of the field pant toward You, for the water brooks are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.




Chapter 2


1 Blow the trumpet in Zion; sound an alarm on My holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming—it is near,
2 a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness. Like dawn spread upon the mountains, a great and powerful people—there has never been anything like it, nor will there be again after it for many generations.


3 Before them a fire devours, and behind them a flame burns. The land before them is like the garden of Eden, but behind them a desolate wilderness—and nothing escapes them.
4 Their appearance is like the appearance of horses, and like war horses they run.
5 With a noise like chariots they leap on the tops of mountains, like the crackling of a flame of fire devouring stubble, like a powerful army set in battle array.
6 Before them peoples writhe in anguish; all faces turn pale.
7 Like mighty men they run, like men of war they scale the wall. Each marches on his own way; they do not swerve from their paths.
8 They do not jostle one another; each marches in his path. They burst through the weapons and are not halted.
9 They rush upon the city, they run on the wall, they climb up into the houses, they enter through the windows like a thief.
10 Before them the earth quakes, the heavens tremble. The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars withdraw their shining.


11 The LORD gives voice before His army, for His camp is exceedingly great. He who executes His word is powerful. For the day of the LORD is great and very dreadful—who can endure it?
12 Yet even now, declares the LORD, return to Me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.
13 Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the LORD your God, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and He relents from sending disaster.
14 Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave behind a blessing—grain offering and drink offering for the LORD your God.


15 Blow the trumpet in Zion; consecrate a fast; call a solemn assembly.
16 Gather the people; sanctify the congregation; assemble the elders; gather the children, even nursing infants. Let the bridegroom come out of his chamber and the bride out of her canopy.
17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare Your people, O LORD, and do not make Your heritage a reproach, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the nations, "Where is their God?"


18 Then the LORD became jealous for His land and had pity on His people.
19 And the LORD answered and said to His people, "Look, I am sending you grain, new wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied with them; and I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.
20 I will remove the northerner far from you and drive him into a parched and desolate land, his front into the eastern sea, and his rear into the western sea. His stench will rise, and his foul smell will ascend, for he has done great things."
21 Do not fear, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the LORD has done great things!
22 Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness sprout, for the tree bears its fruit; the fig tree and vine give their full yield.
23 Be glad, O sons of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God, for He has given you the early rain in righteousness. He sends down for you the rain, the early and the latter rain, as before.
24 The threshing floors shall be full of grain, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.
25 And I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten—the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter—My great army that I sent among you.
26 You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And My people shall never again be put to shame.


27 Then you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and there is no other. And My people shall never again be put to shame.
28 And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh. Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
29 Even on the male and female servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.


30 And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth—blood and fire and columns of smoke.
31 The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes.
32 And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved. For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the LORD has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls.




Chapter 3


1 For you will see in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
2 that I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will enter into judgment with them there on behalf of My people and My heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations and have divided up My land.
3 They cast lots for My people; they traded a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine to drink.


4 What are you to Me, O Tyre and Sidon and all the regions of Philistia? Are you repaying Me for something? If you are repaying Me, I will swiftly and speedily return your payment on your own head.
5 For you have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried My precious treasures into your temples.
6 You sold the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the Greeks, to remove them far from their border.
7 Watch as I stir them up from the place to which you sold them, and I will return your payment on your own head.
8 I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off, for the LORD has spoken.


9 Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate yourselves for war; stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.
10 Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, “I am a warrior.”
11 Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, and gather yourselves there. Bring down Your mighty ones, O LORD!
12 Let the nations stir themselves and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. For there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.
13 Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread, for the winepress is full. The vats overflow, for their evil is great.


14 Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
15 The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their brightness.
16 The LORD roars from Zion and utters His voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth quake. But the LORD is a refuge for His people, a stronghold for the sons of Israel.
17 So you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who dwells in Zion, My holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through her.


18 And it will come to pass in that day that the mountains will drip with sweet wine, and the hills will flow with milk, and all the streambeds of Judah will flow with water. And a spring will go out from the house of the LORD and will water the Valley of Shittim.
19 Egypt shall become a desolation, and Edom a desolate wilderness, because of the violence done to the sons of Judah, in whose land they have shed innocent blood.
20 But Judah shall dwell forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
21 I will avenge their blood—blood I have not yet avenged—for the LORD dwells in Zion.
