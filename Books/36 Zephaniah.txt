Zephaniah


Chapter 1


1 The word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah:
2 “I will utterly sweep away everything from the face of the earth,” declares the LORD.
3 “I will sweep away man and beast; I will sweep away the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, and the stumbling blocks along with the wicked. I will cut off man from the face of the earth,” declares the LORD.


4 “I will stretch out My hand against Judah and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and I will cut off from this place the remnant of Baal, the name of the idolatrous priests along with the priests,
5 those who bow down on the housetops to the host of heaven, those who bow down and swear to the LORD and also swear by Milcom,
6 and those who have turned back from following the LORD, and those who have not sought the LORD nor inquired of Him.
7 Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near, for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice; He has consecrated His guests.
8 And on the day of the LORD’s sacrifice I will punish the princes and the king’s sons and all who array themselves in foreign garments.
9 On that day I will punish everyone who leaps over the threshold, who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.”


10 “And on that day,” declares the LORD, “a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, a wail from the Second Quarter, and a loud crash from the hills.
11 Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar! For all the people of Canaan are undone; all who weigh out silver are cut off.
12 At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are settled on their dregs, who say in their hearts, ‘The LORD will not do good, nor will He do evil.’
13 Their wealth will become plunder, and their houses a desolation. Though they build houses, they will not inhabit them; though they plant vineyards, they will not drink their wine.”


14 The great day of the LORD is near, near and coming very quickly. The sound of the day of the LORD is bitter; there the mighty man cries aloud.
15 That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of ruin and devastation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
16 a day of trumpet blast and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the high towers.


17 “I will bring distress upon mankind, so that they will walk like the blind, because they have sinned against the LORD; and their blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung.”
18 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them on the day of the LORD’s wrath. And in the fire of His jealousy all the earth will be consumed; for He will make a complete end, a sudden destruction of all the inhabitants of the earth.




Chapter 2


1 Gather yourselves together—yes, gather, O shameless nation,
2 before the decree takes effect, before the day passes like chaff, before the burning anger of the LORD comes upon you, before the day of the LORD’s anger comes upon you.
3 Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land who carry out His justice; seek righteousness, seek humility—perhaps you will be hidden on the day of the LORD’s anger.
4 For Gaza shall be abandoned, and Ashkelon shall become a desolation; Ashdod shall be driven out at noon, and Ekron shall be uprooted.
5 Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: “I will destroy you, so that there will be no inhabitant.”
6 And the seacoast shall become pastures, with meadows for shepherds and folds for flocks.
7 And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall pasture on it. In the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down in the evening, for the LORD their God will visit them and restore their fortunes.


8 “I have heard the taunts of Moab and the revilings of the sons of Ammon, with which they have reproached My people and made boasts against their territory.
9 Therefore, as I live,” declares the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “surely Moab shall be like Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah— a place of weeds and salt pits, and a perpetual desolation. The remnant of My people shall plunder them, and the remainder of My nation shall possess them.”
10 This they shall have as punishment for their pride, because they taunted and boasted against the people of the LORD of hosts.
11 They will fear the LORD, for He will famish all the gods of the earth, and all the coastlands of the nations shall bow down to Him, each one from its place.


12 “You also, O Cushites, shall be slain by My sword.”
13 And He will stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria, and He will make Nineveh a desolation, dry as the wilderness.
14 Herds shall lie down in her midst, every kind of beast; the desert owl and the screech owl shall roost on her capitals; a voice shall hoot in the window; desolation shall be on the threshold, for He has laid bare the cedar work.
15 This is the exultant city that dwelt securely, that said in her heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me.” What a desolation she has become, a lair for beasts! Everyone who passes by her hisses and waves his hand.




Chapter 3


1 Woe to the rebellious and defiled city, the oppressing one!
2 She did not listen to the voice; she did not receive correction. She did not trust in the LORD; she did not draw near to her God.
3 Her princes in her midst are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves—they leave nothing for the morning.
4 Her prophets are reckless, treacherous men. Her priests profane what is holy; they do violence to the law.
5 The LORD is righteous in her midst; He does no injustice. Morning by morning He renders His judgment; at dawn He does not fail. But the unjust one knows no shame.
6 “I have cut off nations; their corner towers are desolate. I have made their streets waste, with no one passing by. Their cities are destroyed, without a man to inhabit them.


7 I said, ‘Surely you will fear Me; you will accept correction!’ Then her dwelling would not be cut off, despite everything for which I had punished her. But they eagerly corrupted all their deeds.”
8 “Therefore wait for Me,” declares the LORD, “for the day I rise up to plunder. For My decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out on them My indignation, all My burning anger. For by the fire of My jealousy all the earth will be consumed.
9 And then I will make the peoples speak a pure language, so that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve Him with one accord.


10 From beyond the rivers of Cush My worshipers, the daughter of My dispersed ones, will bring My offering.
11 On that day you will not be ashamed because of all your deeds by which you rebelled against Me. For then I will remove from your midst those who exult in pride, and you shall no longer be haughty on My holy mountain.
12 But I will leave in your midst a meek and humble people, and they shall take refuge in the name of the LORD.
13 The remnant of Israel shall do no injustice and speak no lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths. For they shall feed and lie down, and no one shall make them afraid.


14 Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!
15 The LORD has taken away your judgments; He has turned away your enemy. The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall no longer fear evil.
16 On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, “Do not fear, O Zion; do not let your hands grow weak.
17 The LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with gladness; He will quiet you with His love; He will exult over you with singing.”


18 “I will gather those who grieve for the appointed festivals—you were a burden on her; reproach was upon them.
19 Behold, at that time I will deal with all who oppress you. I will save the lame and gather the outcast, and I will make them a praise and a name in every land of their shame.
20 At that time I will bring you in; at that time I will gather you. For I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes,” says the LORD.
