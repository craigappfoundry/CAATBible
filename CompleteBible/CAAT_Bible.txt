Genesis

Chapter 1

1 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
2 Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.  

3 Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
4 And God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.
5 God called the light "day," and the darkness He called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.  

6 Then God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters, to separate water from water."
7 So God made the expanse and separated the water beneath the expanse from the water above it, and it was so.
8 God called the expanse "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.  

9 Then God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place, and let dry land appear." And it was so.
10 God called the dry land "earth," and the gathered waters He called "seas." And God saw that it was good.  

11 Then God said, "Let the earth produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees bearing fruit with seed in it, according to their kinds." And it was so.
12 The earth brought forth vegetation, seed-bearing plants according to their kinds, and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
13 And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.  

14 Then God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons, days, and years.
15 And let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth." And it was so.
16 God established the two great lights: the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night and the stars.
17 God set them in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth,
18 to rule over the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.
19 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.  

20 Then God said, "Let the waters teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky."
21 So God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
22 Then God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth."
23 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.  

24 Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock, creeping things, and beasts of the earth according to their kinds." And it was so.
25 God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.  

26 Then God said, "Let us make man in Our image, after Our likeness, and let him rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, all the earth, and every creeping thing that moves on the earth."
27 So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.  

28 And God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every living thing that moves on the earth."
29 Then God said, "Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it; they shall be yours for food.
30 And to every beast of the earth, every bird of the sky, and everything that creeps on the earth—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant for food." And it was so.  

31 And God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.


Chapter 2

1 Thus the heavens and the earth, along with all the creatures, were completed.
2 On the seventh day, God finished the work that He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all the work that He had done.
3 Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it He rested from all the work of creation that He had done.  

4 These are the records of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.
5 No shrub of the field had yet appeared on the land, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the Lord God had not sent rain upon the land, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
6 But a mist would rise from the earth and water the entire surface of the ground.  

7 Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.

8 The Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there He placed the man He had formed.
9 The Lord God caused every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food to grow from the ground, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  

10 A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided into four headwaters.
11 The name of the first is Pishon; it flows around the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.
12 The gold of that land is pure; bdellium and onyx stone are also there.
13 The name of the second river is Gihon; it flows around the entire land of Cush.
14 The name of the third river is Tigris; it flows east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.  

15 The Lord God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.
16 Then the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "You may eat freely from any tree of the garden,
17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that you eat from it, you will surely die."  

18 Then the Lord God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make a helper suitable for him."
19 The Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky out of the ground, and He brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
20 The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the field, but for Adam, no suitable helper was found.  

21 So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept, He took one of his ribs and closed up the place with flesh.
22 Then the Lord God fashioned the rib He had taken from the man into a woman and brought her to him.
23 The man said,
"This one, at last, is bone of my bones  
and flesh of my flesh;  
she shall be called Woman,  
for she was taken out of Man."  

24 For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
25 And the man and his wife were both naked, yet they felt no shame.


Chapter 3

1 Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden'?"

2 The woman answered the serpent, "We may eat the fruit of the trees in the garden, 3 but concerning the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, God said, 'You shall not eat from it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.'"

4 But the serpent said to the woman, "You will certainly not die!
5 For God knows that on the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."

6 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was appealing to the eyes, and that it was desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some of its fruit and ate. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate.
7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.

8 Then they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves among the trees of the garden from the presence of the Lord God.
9 But the Lord God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?"

10 He answered, "I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid."  

11 Then He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat?"  

12 The man said, "The woman You gave to be with me—she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate."  

13 Then the Lord God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?"  

The woman answered, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."  

14 So the Lord God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this,  
you are cursed more than all livestock  
and more than any wild animal.  
You will crawl on your belly  
and eat dust all the days of your life.  

15 I will put hostility between you and the woman,  
and between your offspring and her offspring.  
He will strike your head,  
and you will strike his heel."  

16 To the woman He said,  
"I will greatly increase your pain in childbirth;  
with painful labor you will give birth to children.  
Your desire will be for your husband,  
but he will rule over you."  

17 And to Adam He said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat from it,'  
cursed is the ground because of you;  
through painful toil you will eat from it all the days of your life.  

18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you,  
and you will eat the plants of the field.  

19 By the sweat of your brow you will eat bread  
until you return to the ground,  
because from it you were taken.  
For you are dust,  
and to dust you will return."  

20 The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all the living.  

21 And the Lord God made garments of animal skins for Adam and his wife and clothed them.  

22 Then the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and also take from the tree of life and eat, and live forever—"
23 the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.  

24 He drove the man out, and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned in every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.


Chapter 4

1 Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain. She said, "I have acquired a man with the help of the Lord."
2 Later, she gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel became a shepherd of flocks, but Cain worked the ground.  

3 In the course of time, Cain brought an offering to the Lord from the fruit of the ground,
4 while Abel also brought an offering—some of the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions. The Lord looked favorably on Abel and his offering,
5 but He did not look with favor on Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry, and his face fell.  

6 Then the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?
7 If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it."  

8 Cain spoke to his brother Abel, and when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.
9 Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" He answered, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"  

10 The Lord said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to Me from the ground!
11 So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
12 When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."  

13 Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is too great to bear!
14 Behold, You are driving me away today from the face of the ground, and I will be hidden from Your presence. I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."  

15 But the Lord said to him, "Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." And the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.
16 Then Cain went out from the Lord's presence and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.  

17 Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. Then Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch.
18 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.  

19 Lamech took two wives for himself. The name of the first was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah.
20 Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
21 His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the lyre and flute.
22 Zillah also bore Tubal-cain, a forger of all kinds of bronze and iron tools. Tubal-cain's sister was Naamah.  

23 Then Lamech said to his wives,  
"Adah and Zillah, hear my voice!  
Wives of Lamech, listen to my speech!  
I have killed a man for wounding me,  
a young man for striking me.  
24 If Cain is avenged sevenfold,  
then Lamech seventy-sevenfold."  

25 Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has given me another son in place of Abel, because Cain killed him."
26 A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time, men began to call on the name of the Lord.  

 

Chapter 5

1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in the likeness of God.
2 He created them male and female, and He blessed them and called them Man in the day they were created.  

3 When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own likeness, after his image, and he named him Seth.
4 The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years, and he had other sons and daughters.
5 So all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, and he died.  

6 When Seth had lived 105 years, he fathered Enosh.
7 After he fathered Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters.
8 So all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died.  

9 When Enosh had lived 90 years, he fathered Kenan.
10 After he fathered Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters.
11 So all the days of Enosh were 905 years, and he died.  

12 When Kenan had lived 70 years, he fathered Mahalalel.
13 After he fathered Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters.
14 So all the days of Kenan were 910 years, and he died.  

15 When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he fathered Jared.
16 After he fathered Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters.
17 So all the days of Mahalalel were 895 years, and he died.  

18 When Jared had lived 162 years, he fathered Enoch.
19 After he fathered Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
20 So all the days of Jared were 962 years, and he died.  

21 When Enoch had lived 65 years, he fathered Methuselah.
22 After he fathered Methuselah, Enoch walked with God for 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
23 So all the days of Enoch were 365 years.
24 Enoch walked with God, and he was no more, for God took him.  

25 When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he fathered Lamech.
26 After he fathered Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters.
27 So all the days of Methuselah were 969 years, and he died.  

28 When Lamech had lived 182 years, he fathered a son.
29 He named him Noah, saying, "This one shall comfort us in our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground that the Lord has cursed."
30 After he fathered Noah, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters.
31 So all the days of Lamech were 777 years, and he died.  

32 When Noah was 500 years old, he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.


Chapter 6

1 When men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born to them,
2 the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they took wives for themselves from whomever they chose.
3 Then the Lord said, "My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days shall be 120 years."  

4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God came to the daughters of men and had children by them. These were the mighty men of old, men of renown.  

5 The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time.
6 The Lord regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was deeply grieved in His heart.
7 So the Lord said, "I will wipe out man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—man and animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky—for I regret that I have made them."
8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.  

9 This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among his generation. Noah walked with God.
10 And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  

11 Now the earth was corrupt before God, and it was filled with violence.
12 God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth.
13 Then God said to Noah, "I have determined to put an end to all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. Behold, I will destroy them along with the earth.  

14 Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark and cover it inside and out with pitch.
15 This is how you are to build it: The length of the ark shall be 300 cubits, its width 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.
16 Make a roof for the ark, finishing it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark on its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks.  

17 Behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh under heaven in which there is the breath of life; everything on earth shall perish.
18 But I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall enter the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
19 And you shall bring into the ark two of every kind of living thing, male and female, to keep them alive with you.
20 Of the birds according to their kinds, of the animals according to their kinds, and of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of each shall come to you to be kept alive.
21 And take with you every kind of food that is eaten, and store it up; it shall serve as food for you and for them."  

22 Noah did everything exactly as God had commanded him.


Chapter 7

1 Then the Lord said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before Me in this generation.
2 Take with you seven pairs of every clean animal, a male and its female, and one pair of every unclean animal, a male and its female,
3 and also seven pairs of the birds of the heavens, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.
4 For in seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe out from the face of the earth every living thing that I have made."
5 And Noah did all that the Lord commanded him.

6 Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came upon the earth.
7 And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
8 Of clean animals and of animals that are not clean, and of birds and of everything that creeps on the ground,
9 two by two, male and female, they entered the ark with Noah, just as God had commanded Noah.
10 And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.

11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that very day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
12 And the rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.
13 On that very day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons entered the ark,
14 along with every beast according to its kind, and all the livestock according to their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth according to its kind, and every bird according to its kind, every winged creature.
15 They went into the ark with Noah, two by two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
16 And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him, and the Lord shut him in.

17 The flood continued for forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.
18 The waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the waters.
19 The waters rose so high over the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.
20 The waters rose fifteen cubits higher, covering the mountains.

21 And all flesh that moved on the earth perished—birds, livestock, beasts, every swarming thing that swarms on the earth, and all mankind.
22 Everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
23 God wiped out every living thing that was on the face of the ground—man and beast and creeping things and birds of the heavens—they were all blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.
24 And the waters prevailed on the earth for one hundred and fifty days.


Chapter 8

1 And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters began to subside.
2 The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, and the rain from the heavens was restrained.
3 The waters receded steadily from the earth, and at the end of one hundred and fifty days, the waters had diminished.
4 In the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
5 The waters continued to recede until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible.  

6 After forty days, Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made
7 and sent out a raven, and it went back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth.
8 Then he sent out a dove to see whether the waters had receded from the surface of the ground.
9 But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him in the ark, for the waters still covered the surface of the earth. So he reached out his hand, took her, and brought her back into the ark.

10 He waited another seven days and again sent out the dove from the ark.
11 The dove returned to him in the evening, and there in her beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth.
12 He waited another seven days and sent out the dove again, but she did not return to him.

13 In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the waters had dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was drying.
14 By the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was completely dry.

15 Then God spoke to Noah, saying,
16 "Come out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and their wives with you.
17 Bring out with you every living thing that is with you—all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that moves on the earth—so that they may swarm over the earth, be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth."  

18 So Noah came out, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives.
19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird—everything that moves on the earth—came out of the ark, each according to its kind.

20 Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and took some of every clean animal and every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
21 The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in His heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of man, even though the inclination of his heart is evil from his youth. Nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.

22 As long as the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."


Chapter 9

1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.
2 The fear and dread of you will be upon every beast of the earth, every bird of the sky, everything that moves on the ground, and all the fish of the sea. They are given into your hands.
3 Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.
4 But you shall not eat flesh with its lifeblood still in it.
5 And surely I will require a reckoning for your lifeblood; from every beast I will demand it, and from man as well. From his fellow man I will require the life of the man who sheds blood.

6 Whoever sheds man's blood,  
   by man his blood shall be shed,  
   for in the image of God He made man.

7 As for you, be fruitful and multiply; spread out and fill the earth."

8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,
9 "Behold, I am establishing My covenant with you, and with your descendants after you,
10 and with every living creature that is with you—the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, all that came out of the ark, every living thing of the earth.
11 I establish My covenant with you: Never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, nor shall there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth."

12 Then God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between Me and you and every living creature with you, for perpetual generations:
13 I have set My rainbow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.
14 Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
15 I will remember My covenant between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and never again shall the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16 When the rainbow is in the clouds, I will look upon it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh on the earth."
17 And God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant I have established between Me and all flesh on the earth."  

18 Now the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.
19 These three were the sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was populated.  

20 Then Noah, a man of the soil, began to plant a vineyard.
21 When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and uncovered himself inside his tent.
22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside.
23 But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on their shoulders, and walked backward to cover their father's nakedness. Their faces were turned away so that they did not see their father's nakedness.

24 When Noah awoke from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him,
25 he said,  

   "Cursed be Canaan!  
   A servant of servants shall he be to his brothers."

26 He also said,  

   "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem!  
   May Canaan be his servant.
   27 May God enlarge Japheth,  
   and may he dwell in the tents of Shem,  
   and may Canaan be his servant."

28 After the flood, Noah lived 350 years.
29 All the days of Noah were 950 years, and then he died.  


Chapter 10

1 These are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.

2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
3 The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
4 The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
5 From these the coastlands of the nations spread out, each with its own land, language, clan, and nation.

6 The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
7 The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
8 Cush fathered Nimrod, who was the first to be a mighty man on the earth.
9 He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore, it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord."
10 The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
11 From that land he went into Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,
12 and Resen, which lies between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.

13 Mizraim fathered the Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
14 Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim.

15 Canaan fathered Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth,
16 as well as the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite,
17 the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite,
18 the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward, the clans of the Canaanites spread out.
19 The Canaanite boundary extended from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
20 These were the sons of Ham, according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.

21 Sons were also born to Shem, the elder brother of Japheth and the father of all the sons of Eber.
22 The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
23 The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
24 Arpachshad fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber.
25 Two sons were born to Eber: the name of the first was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan.
26 Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
30 Their settlements extended from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.

31 These were the sons of Shem, according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.
32 These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations. From them the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.


Chapter 11

1 Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.
2 As men migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
3 They said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly." So they used brick for stone and tar for mortar.
4 Then they said, "Come, let us build for ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth."

5 But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men were building.
6 The Lord said, "Behold, they are one people with one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. Now nothing they propose to do will be impossible for them.
7 Come, let Us go down and confuse their language so that they will not understand one another's speech."
8 So the Lord scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth, and they stopped building the city.
9 Therefore, its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of the whole earth, and from there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.

10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was 100 years old when he fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood.
11 After he fathered Arpachshad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.

12 When Arpachshad was 35 years old, he fathered Shelah.
13 After he fathered Shelah, Arpachshad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.

14 When Shelah was 30 years old, he fathered Eber.
15 After he fathered Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.

16 When Eber was 34 years old, he fathered Peleg.
17 After he fathered Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.

18 When Peleg was 30 years old, he fathered Reu.
19 After he fathered Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.

20 When Reu was 32 years old, he fathered Serug.
21 After he fathered Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.

22 When Serug was 30 years old, he fathered Nahor.
23 After he fathered Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.

24 When Nahor was 29 years old, he fathered Terah.
25 After he fathered Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.

26 When Terah was 70 years old, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

27 These are the generations of Terah: Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and Haran fathered Lot.
28 Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
29 Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah.
30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

31 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and they set out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there.
32 Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Haran.


Chapter 12

1 The Lord said to Abram, "Go from your land, your relatives, and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
2 I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
3 I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those who treat you with contempt, and all the families of the earth will be blessed through you."

4 So Abram went, just as the Lord had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran.
5 He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated, and the servants they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan. When they arrived in Canaan,
6 Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The Canaanites were in the land at that time.

7 Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, "To your offspring I will give this land." So he built an altar there to the Lord, who had appeared to him.
8 From there he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel to the west and Ai to the east. He built an altar to the Lord there and called on the name of the Lord.
9 Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.

10 There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to stay there for a while, because the famine was severe in the land.
11 As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "Look, I know that you are a beautiful woman.
12 When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife,' and they will kill me but let you live.
13 Please say that you are my sister, so that it will go well for me because of you and my life will be spared on your account."

14 When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
15 Pharaoh's officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh, and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16 He treated Abram well because of her, and Abram acquired flocks and herds, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.

17 But the Lord struck Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Abram's wife Sarai.
18 So Pharaoh summoned Abram and said, "What have you done to me? Why didn't you tell me she was your wife?
19 Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her as my wife? Now, here is your wife—take her and go!"
20 Then Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.


Chapter 13

1 So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negev.
2 Now Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.
3 He journeyed by stages from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
4 to the place of the altar that he had made there at first. And there Abram called on the name of the Lord.

5 Now Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents.
6 But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together.
7 And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. (At that time, the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.)

8 Then Abram said to Lot, "Please, let there be no strife between me and you, or between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.
9 Is not the whole land before you? Please, separate from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; or if you go to the right, then I will go to the left."

10 Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered everywhere (before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah), like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as far as Zoar.
11 So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other.
12 Abram settled in the land of Canaan, but Lot settled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.
13 Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinful against the Lord.

14 The Lord said to Abram after Lot had separated from him, "Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are—northward, southward, eastward, and westward—
15 for all the land that you see, I will give to you and to your descendants forever.
16 And I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust of the earth, then your descendants also could be counted.
17 Arise, walk through the land, its length and its breadth, for I am giving it to you."

18 So Abram moved his tent and went to dwell by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.


Chapter 14

1 In the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
2 these kings waged war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
3 All these gathered together in the Valley of Siddim (which is the Salt Sea).
4 For twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.  

5 In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
6 and the Horites in their hill country of Seir, as far as El-paran, which is by the wilderness.
7 Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they struck down all the territory of the Amalekites and also the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.  

8 Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out and drew up battle lines in the Valley of Siddim
9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five.
10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, while the rest fled to the hill country.
11 Then the victors seized all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, along with all their food, and departed.
12 They also took Lot, the son of Abram's brother, and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom, and they went on their way.  

13 Then one who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew, who was dwelling by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol and Aner, who were allies of Abram.
14 When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he armed his 318 trained men, born in his household, and pursued them as far as Dan.
15 During the night, he divided his men and attacked them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.
16 He recovered all the possessions and also brought back his relative Lot with his possessions, as well as the women and the other men.  

17 After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
18 And Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine. He was a priest of God Most High.
19 He blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth!
20 And blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!" And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.  

21 Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the men, but take the possessions for yourself."
22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have raised my hand in an oath to the Lord, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
23 that I will take nothing belonging to you—not even a thread or a sandal strap—so that you may never say, 'I made Abram rich.'
24 I will accept nothing but what the young men have eaten and the share for the men who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion."


Chapter 15

1 After these events, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield; your reward will be very great."

2 But Abram said, "Lord GOD, what can You give me, since I remain childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?"
3 And Abram continued, "Look, You have not given me offspring, so a servant in my household will be my heir."

4 Then, behold, the word of the LORD came to him: "This man will not be your heir; rather, one who comes from your own body will be your heir."
5 He took him outside and said, "Look at the sky and count the stars, if you are able to count them." Then He said to him, "So shall your descendants be."
6 And Abram believed the LORD, and He credited it to him as righteousness.

7 Then He said to him, "I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess."
8 But Abram said, "Lord GOD, how can I know that I will possess it?"

9 He said to him, "Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
10 So he brought all these to Him, cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other, but he did not cut the birds in half.
11 Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.

12 As the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and terror and great darkness overwhelmed him.
13 Then the LORD said to Abram, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not their own, and they will serve them and be oppressed for four hundred years.
14 But I will judge the nation they serve, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.
15 As for you, you will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age.
16 In the fourth generation, they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete."  

17 When the sun had set and it was dark, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch passed between the divided pieces.
18 On that day, the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates—
19 the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
20 Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaim,
21 Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites."


Chapter 16

1 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.
2 So Sarai said to Abram, "Look, the Lord has kept me from bearing children. Go to my maidservant; perhaps I will obtain children through her." And Abram listened to Sarai's voice.

3 So after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, his wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her maidservant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife.
4 And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress became insignificant in her eyes.

5 Then Sarai said to Abram, "The wrong done to me is on you! I put my maidservant into your arms, but now that she sees she has conceived, I am despised in her eyes. May the Lord judge between me and you."
6 But Abram said to Sarai, "Look, your maidservant is in your hands. Do with her whatever is good in your eyes." Then Sarai afflicted her, and she fled from her presence.

7 Now the angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.
8 And he said, "Hagar, maidservant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?" She said, "I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai."

9 Then the angel of the Lord said to her, "Return to your mistress and submit yourself under her hand."
10 And the angel of the Lord said, "I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count."
11 And the angel of the Lord said to her, "Behold, you are pregnant and will bear a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the Lord has heard your affliction.
12 He will be a wild man; his hand will be against everyone, and everyone's hand will be against him. And he will dwell in hostility toward all his brothers."

13 Then she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "Have I also seen Him here, who sees me?"
14 Therefore, the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. It is between Kadesh and Bered.

15 And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.


Chapter 17

1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said, "I am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless.
2 I will establish my covenant between me and you, and I will greatly multiply you."

3 Then Abram fell facedown, and God spoke to him, saying,
4 "As for me, here is my covenant with you: You will become the father of many nations.
5 No longer will your name be Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you the father of many nations.
6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.
7 I will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you.
8 And I will give to you and to your descendants after you the land where you are living as a foreigner—all the land of Canaan—as an everlasting possession, and I will be their God."

9 Then God said to Abraham, "You must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.
10 This is my covenant that you are to keep, between me and you and your descendants after you: Every male among you must be circumcised.
11 You are to be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.
12 Every male among you, eight days old, must be circumcised, every male throughout your generations, whether born in your household or purchased with money from a foreigner who is not your descendant.
13 Whether born in your house or purchased with money, they must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant.
14 If any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, is found among you, he will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant."

15 Then God said to Abraham, "As for your wife Sarai, you must not call her Sarai, for her name will be Sarah.
16 I will bless her; indeed, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will become nations; kings of peoples will come from her."

17 Then Abraham fell facedown and laughed, saying in his heart, "Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah give birth at ninety years old?"
18 So Abraham said to God, "If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!"

19 But God said, "No. Your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you. I will bless him, make him fruitful, and greatly multiply him. He will father twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.
21 But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year."

22 When God had finished speaking with Abraham, he departed from him.

23 Then Abraham took his son Ishmael and all the males born in his household or purchased with his money—every male among the men of Abraham's household—and circumcised them that very day, just as God had told him.
24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,
25 and his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised.
26 On that very day, Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised,
27 and all the men of his household—those born in his house and those purchased with money from a foreigner—were circumcised with him.


Chapter 18

1 The Lord appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre as he sat at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day.
2 He lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed himself to the ground.
3 He said, "My lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.
4 Let a little water be brought so that you may wash your feet and rest under the tree.
5 I will bring a morsel of bread so that you may refresh yourselves; after that, you may continue on your way, since you have come to your servant." So they said, "Do as you have said."

6 Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, "Quick! Three measures of fine flour—knead it and make cakes."
7 Then Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and choice calf, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.
8 He took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree while they ate.

9 They said to him, "Where is Sarah, your wife?" He replied, "There, in the tent."
10 Then one said, "I will surely return to you at this time next year, and behold, Sarah, your wife, will have a son." Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent behind him.
11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years; Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.
12 So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I am worn out and my lord is old, shall I have this pleasure?"

13 The Lord said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?'
14 Is anything too difficult for the Lord? At the appointed time, I will return to you, at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son."
15 But Sarah denied it, saying, "I did not laugh," for she was afraid. He said, "No, but you did laugh."

16 Then the men set out from there and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to send them on their way.
17 The Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
18 since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him?
19 For I have chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice, so that the Lord may bring upon Abraham what he has promised him."

20 Then the Lord said, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and their sin is very grievous.
21 I will go down and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. If not, I will know."

22 The men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the Lord.
23 Abraham drew near and said, "Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
24 Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?
25 Far be it from you to do such a thing—to slay the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous the same as the wicked! Far be it from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"

26 The Lord said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake."

27 Abraham answered, "Behold, I have undertaken to speak to my Lord, though I am but dust and ashes.
28 Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking—will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" He said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."

29 Again he spoke to him and said, "Suppose forty are found there." He said, "I will not do it for the sake of forty."

30 Then he said, "Please do not be angry, my Lord, and let me speak. Suppose thirty are found there." He said, "I will not do it if I find thirty there."

31 He said, "Behold, I have undertaken to speak to my Lord. Suppose twenty are found there." He said, "I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty."

32 Then he said, "Please do not let my Lord be angry, and I will speak only this once more. Suppose ten are found there." He said, "I will not destroy it for the sake of ten."

33 When the Lord had finished speaking with Abraham, he departed, and Abraham returned to his place.


Chapter 19

1 The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting at the city gate. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed with his face to the ground.
2 He said, "My lords, please turn aside to your servant's house, spend the night, and wash your feet. Then you can rise early and go on your way."

But they said, "No, we will spend the night in the square."

3 However, he strongly urged them, so they turned aside to him, and entered his house. He prepared a feast for them, baking unleavened bread, and they ate.

4 Before they lay down, the men of the city—the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people from every quarter—surrounded the house.
5 They called to Lot and said, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may know them."

6 Lot went out to them at the entrance and shut the door behind him.
7 He said, "Please, my brothers, do not do this evil thing.
8 Look, I have two daughters who have never known a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them as you see fit. But do not do anything to these men, since they have come under the protection of my roof."

9 But they said, "Stand back!" Then they said, "This fellow came as a foreigner, and now he dares to judge us! We will deal worse with you than with them." They pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door down.

10 But the men reached out and pulled Lot into the house with them and shut the door.
11 Then they struck the men at the entrance, both small and great, with blindness, so that they wore themselves out trying to find the door.

12 Then the men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here—a son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of this place,
13 because we are about to destroy it. The outcry against this city has grown so great before the Lord that He has sent us to destroy it."

14 So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, "Get up! Get out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.

15 When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city."

16 But he hesitated. So the men took hold of his hand, his wife's hand, and the hands of his two daughters—because of the Lord's mercy to him—and they led him out and set him outside the city.

17 When they had brought them out, one of them said, "Flee for your life! Do not look back or stop anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away!"

18 But Lot said to them, "No, my lords!
19 Your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot flee to the mountains, or disaster will overtake me and I will die.
20 Look, this town is near enough to flee to, and it is a small one. Let me go there so that I may live. Is it not a small place?"

21 He said to him, "Very well, I grant you this request also—I will not destroy the town you speak of.
22 Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there." That is why the town was called Zoar.

23 The sun had risen over the land when Lot arrived in Zoar.
24 Then the Lord rained sulfur and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah from the Lord out of the heavens.
25 He overthrew those cities, the entire plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and everything growing on the ground.

26 But Lot's wife, who was behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.

27 Early in the morning, Abraham went to the place where he had stood before the Lord.
28 He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain, and he saw that smoke was rising from the land like the smoke of a furnace.

29 So it was, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that He remembered Abraham and brought Lot out of the midst of the destruction when He overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.

30 Lot went up from Zoar and settled in the mountains with his two daughters because he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.

31 The older daughter said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to come to us as is the custom everywhere.
32 Come, let us give our father wine to drink and lie with him, so that we may preserve our father's lineage."

33 That night they gave their father wine to drink, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was unaware when she lay down or when she got up.

34 The next day, the older daughter said to the younger, "Look, I lay with my father last night. Let us give him wine to drink again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so that we may preserve our father's lineage."

35 So they gave their father wine to drink that night as well, and the younger daughter went in and lay with him. He was unaware when she lay down or when she got up.

36 So both of Lot's daughters conceived by their father.
37 The older daughter bore a son and named him Moab—he became the father of the Moabites of today.
38 The younger daughter also bore a son and named him Ben-Ammi—he became the father of the Ammonites of today.


Chapter 20

1 Abraham journeyed from there toward the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he sojourned in Gerar.
2 Abraham said of Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for Sarah and took her.

3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, "Behold, you are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman."
4 Now Abimelech had not come near her, so he said, "Lord, will You slay even a righteous nation?
5 Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself also said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands, I have done this."

6 Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart, and I also kept you from sinning against Me; therefore, I did not allow you to touch her.
7 Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. But if you do not return her, know that you will surely die, you and all who belong to you."

8 So Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants, and spoke all these things in their hearing, and the men were greatly afraid.
9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought this great sin upon me and my kingdom? You have done to me things that should not be done."
10 And Abimelech asked Abraham, "What were you thinking, that you did this thing?"

11 Abraham said, "I did it because I thought, 'Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'
12 Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.
13 And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must show me: wherever we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'"

14 Then Abimelech took sheep, cattle, and male and female servants and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah, his wife, to him.
15 And Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please."
16 And to Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given a thousand pieces of silver to your brother. It is a vindication before all who are with you; you are fully vindicated."

17 Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, so that they could bear children again.
18 For the Lord had completely closed the wombs of all the women in Abimelech's household because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.


Chapter 21

1 The Lord visited Sarah as He had said, and the Lord did for Sarah what He had promised.
2 So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time God had spoken to him.
3 Abraham named his son who was born to him, the son Sarah bore him, Isaac.
4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, just as God had commanded him.
5 Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.

6 And Sarah said, "God has made me laugh, and everyone who hears will laugh with me."
7 She also said, "Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne a son for him in his old age."

8 The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.
9 But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
10 So she said to Abraham, "Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not share in the inheritance with my son Isaac."

11 This matter was very distressing to Abraham because of his son.
12 But God said to Abraham, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman. Listen to everything Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring shall be named.
13 Yet I will also make a nation of the son of the slave woman, because he is your offspring."

14 So Abraham rose early in the morning, took bread and a skin of water, and gave them to Hagar. He placed them on her shoulder and sent her away with the boy. She departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
15 When the water in the skin was gone, she placed the boy under one of the bushes.
16 Then she went and sat down at a distance, about a bowshot away, for she said, "Let me not see the boy die." As she sat there, she wept aloud.

17 God heard the boy's voice, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
18 Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make him into a large nation."
19 Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.

20 God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness and became an archer.
21 He settled in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.

22 At that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in everything you do.
23 Now therefore, swear to me by God that you will not deal falsely with me, my offspring, or my descendants. Show to me, and to the land where you have lived as a foreigner, the same kindness I have shown to you."

24 Abraham said, "I swear it."
25 Then Abraham reproached Abimelech concerning a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized.
26 But Abimelech replied, "I do not know who did this; you have not spoken of this to me before, nor have I heard of it until today."

27 So Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made an agreement.
28 Abraham set seven ewe lambs apart from the flock.
29 And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?"
30 He replied, "You are to take these seven ewe lambs from me as a witness that I dug this well."
31 Therefore, that place was called Beersheba, because the two of them swore an oath there.

32 After they had made an agreement at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines.
33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God.
34 And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for many days.


Chapter 22

1 After these things, God tested Abraham and said to him, "Abraham!"

And he said, "Here I am."

2 Then He said, "Take your son, Isaac, your only son, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I will show you."

3 So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, along with his son Isaac. He split the wood for the burnt offering and set out for the place that God had told him about.

4 On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
5 Then he said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there to worship, and then we will return to you."

6 Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac. He carried the fire and the knife, and the two of them walked on together.
7 Then Isaac spoke to his father Abraham, saying, "My father!"

And he replied, "Here I am, my son."

Isaac said, "Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"

8 Abraham answered, "God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them continued on together.

9 When they arrived at the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.

11 But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven, saying, "Abraham, Abraham!"

And he answered, "Here I am."

12 Then He said, "Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me."

13 Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. So he went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son.
14 And Abraham named that place "The Lord Will Provide," as it is said to this day, "It will be provided, on the mountain of the Lord."

15 Then the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven
16 and said, "By Myself I have sworn, declares the Lord, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,
17 I will surely bless you and greatly multiply your offspring like the stars of the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your offspring will possess the gate of their enemies,
18 and through your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice."

19 Then Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba, and Abraham lived in Beersheba.

20 After these things, Abraham was told, "Milcah has also borne sons to your brother Nahor:
21 Uz, his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
23 (Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) Milcah bore these eight to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
24 His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.


Chapter 23

1 Sarah lived to be 127 years old—these were the years of Sarah's life.  
2 She died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.  
3 Then Abraham rose from beside his dead and spoke to the Hittites:  
4 "I am a sojourner and a foreigner among you. Grant me a burial site among you so I may bury my dead out of my sight."
5 The Hittites answered Abraham,
6 "Listen to us, my lord. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold his tomb from you to bury your dead."
7 Then Abraham rose and bowed before the Hittites, the people living in that land.  
8 He spoke to them, saying, "If you are willing for me to bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and intercede for me with Ephron son of Zohar,  
9 so that he may give me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him, at the end of his field. Let him give it to me in your presence for the full price as a burial site."  
10 Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites who had gathered at the city gate:  
11 "No, my lord, listen to me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of my people, I give it to you. Bury your dead."  
12 Then Abraham bowed before the people of the land.  
13 He spoke to Ephron in their hearing: "Please listen to me. I will pay the price for the field. Accept it from me so that I may bury my dead there."  
14 Ephron answered Abraham,  
15 "My lord, listen to me. The land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead."  
16 Abraham agreed to Ephron's terms and weighed out for him the silver he had mentioned in the hearing of the Hittites—four hundred shekels of silver, according to the standard commercial weight.  

17 So Ephron's field in Machpelah near Mamre—the field with the cave in it, and all the trees within the field's boundaries—was transferred  
18 to Abraham's possession in the sight of the Hittites who had gathered at the city gate.  
19 Afterward, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field of Machpelah near Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.  
20 The field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.


Chapter 24

1 Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years, and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.  
2 Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household who was in charge of all he owned, "Place your hand under my thigh,  
3 so that I may make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I live,  
4 but that you will go to my homeland and to my kindred and take a wife for my son Isaac from there."  
5 The servant said to him, "What if the woman is not willing to follow me back to this land? Should I then take your son back to the land from which you came?"  
6 Abraham answered him, "Make sure that you do not take my son back there.  
7 The Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred, spoke to me and swore to me, saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land.' He will send His angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
8 But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be released from this oath of mine—only do not take my son back there."
9 So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore to him concerning this matter.

10 Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking with him all kinds of valuable objects from his master's wealth. He arose and went to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor.
11 He made the camels kneel outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water.
12 He said, "O Lord, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show your loyal love to my master Abraham.
13 I am here, standing beside the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.  
14 Let it be that the girl to whom I say, 'Please lower your jar so that I may drink,' and who replies, 'Drink, and I will also water your camels'—let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. By this I will know that You have shown loyal love to my master."

15 Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother.  
16 The girl was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.  
17 Then the servant ran to meet her and said, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar."  
18 She said, "Drink, my lord," and quickly lowered her jar to her hand and gave him a drink.  
19 When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, "I will also draw water for your camels until they have finished drinking."  
20 So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew for all his camels.  
21 The man watched her silently to know whether the Lord had made his journey successful or not.

22 When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing half a shekel and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten shekels of gold,
23 and he said, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to stay overnight?"
24 She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
25 She also said to him, "We have both straw and fodder in abundance, and a place to stay."  
26 Then the man bowed his head and worshiped the Lord
27 and said, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld His loyal love and His faithfulness from my master. As for me, the Lord has guided me on the way to the house of my master's relatives."

28 The girl ran and told her mother's household what had happened.
29 Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and Laban ran out to the man at the spring.
30 When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms and heard Rebekah recount the words of the man, he went to him, and found him, standing by the camels at the spring.
31 Laban said, "Come, blessed of the Lord! Why are you standing outside? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."  
32 So the man came to the house, and they unloaded the camels. Straw and fodder were given to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.  
33 Then food was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told my business." So they said, "Speak."

34 And he said, "I am Abraham's servant.  
35 The Lord has greatly blessed my master, and he has become wealthy. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female servants, camels and donkeys.  
36 Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all he owns.  
37 My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell,  
38 but you shall go to my father's house and to my clan, and take a wife from there for my son.'  
39 Then I said to my master, 'What if the woman will not follow me?'
40 But he said to me, 'The Lord, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you and make your way successful. You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father's house.
41 Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my clan. And if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.'

42 I came today to the spring and said, 'O Lord, God of my master Abraham, if You are indeed making my journey successful,
43 behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let it be that the young woman who comes out to draw water, to whom I say, "Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,"
44 that if she says to me, "Drink, and I will also draw for your camels," let her be the woman the Lord has appointed for my master's son.'  
45 Before I had finished speaking in my heart, Rebekah approached with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'  
46 She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I will also water your camels.' So I drank, and she also watered the camels.
47 Then I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.' So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.  
48 Then I bowed down and worshiped the Lord and blessed the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right way to take the daughter of my master's relative for his son.
49 Now then, if you intend to show loyal love and faithfulness to my master, tell me. But if not, tell me, so that I may turn either to the right or to the left."

50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered, "This matter has come from the Lord; we cannot speak to you either bad or good.  
51 Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, just as the Lord has spoken."

52 When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before the Lord.  
53 And the servant brought out articles of silver and gold and garments and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.  
54 Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up in the morning, he said, "Send me away to my master."  
55 But her brother and her mother said, "Let the girl stay with us a few days, at least ten; then she may go."  
56 But he said to them, "Do not delay me, since the Lord has made my journey successful. Send me away so that I may go to my master."  
57 They said, "Let us call the girl and ask her."  
58 So they called Rebekah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" And she said, "I will go."

59 So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse, along with Abraham's servant and his men.  
60 They blessed Rebekah and said to her, "Our sister, may you become thousands upon thousands, and may your offspring possess the gate of those who hate them."

61 Then Rebekah and her servant girls got up, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and went on his way.

62 Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi and was living in the Negev.  
63 He went out to pray in the field toward evening. When he looked up, he saw camels coming.  
64 Rebekah also looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she got down from the camel  
65 and said to the servant, "Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?" The servant said, "It is my master." So she took her veil and covered herself.

66 Then the servant told Isaac everything he had done.  
67 Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.


Chapter 25

1 Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Keturah.  
2 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.  
3 Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurim, the Letushim, and the Leummim.  
4 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.  
5 Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,  
6 but to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts. While he was still alive, he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward, to the land of the east.

7 These are the days of the years of Abraham's life: one hundred and seventy-five years.  
8 Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man, full of years, and he was gathered to his people.
9 Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which faces Mamre,  
10 the field that Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, with Sarah his wife.  
11 After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son, and Isaac lived at Beer-lahai-roi.

12 These are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's servant, bore to Abraham.  
13 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,  
14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,  
15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.  
16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their settlements and encampments, twelve princes according to their tribes.  
17 These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.  
18 They dwelt from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt as one goes toward Assyria. He settled in defiance of all his brothers.

19 These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham fathered Isaac,  
20 and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, as his wife.  
21 Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. The LORD granted his plea, and Rebekah his wife conceived.  
22 But the children struggled within her, and she said, "If it occurs like this, why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.  
23 The LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated. One people shall be stronger than the other, and the older shall serve the younger."  
24 When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb.  
25 The first came out red, all over like a hairy garment, so they named him Esau.  
26 After that his brother came out, with his hand gripping Esau's heel, so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.

27 The boys grew up. Esau became a skilled hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a quiet man, living among the tents.  
28 Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for wild game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.  
29 Once, when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted.  
30 Esau said to Jacob, "Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am famished." This is why he was also called Edom.  
31 Jacob said, "First sell me your birthright."  
32 Esau said, "Look, I am about to die; what use is a birthright to me?"  
33 Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.  
34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.


Chapter 26

1 There was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that had occurred in Abraham's days. So Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, in Gerar.  
2 And the LORD appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt. Stay in the land that I will show you.  
3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and bless you. For to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will confirm the oath that I swore to your father Abraham.  
4 I will multiply your offspring like the stars of heaven and will give to your descendants all these lands. And through your seed all the nations of the earth will be blessed—  
5 because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."  

6 So Isaac settled in Gerar.  
7 And when the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "my wife," thinking, "the men of this place might kill me because of Rebekah," since she was attractive in appearance.  
8 After he had been there for some time, Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looked out a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.  
9 Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, "So, she's your wife! Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac said to him, "Because I thought I might die on account of her."  
10 Abimelech said, "What is this you've done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us!"  
11 So Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, "Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."

12 Isaac sowed seed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold, for the LORD blessed him.  
13 The man became rich and continued to grow richer until he became exceedingly wealthy.  
14 He had flocks and herds and many servants, and the Philistines envied him.  
15 So the Philistines stopped up all the wells that his father's servants had dug in Abraham's time, filling them with earth.  
16 Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we are."

17 So Isaac departed from there and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.  
18 Isaac again dug the wells of water that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died. He gave them the same names that his father had given them.  
19 Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of flowing water.  
20 But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, "The water is ours." So he named the well Esek, because they contended with him.  
21 Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that one too. So he named it Sitnah.  
22 He moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he named it Rehoboth, saying, "Now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."

23 From there he went up to Beersheba.  
24 And the LORD appeared to him that night and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your offspring for the sake of my servant Abraham."  
25 So he built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD, and he pitched his tent there. And Isaac's servants dug a well.

26 Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.  
27 Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?"  
28 They said, "We clearly saw that the LORD has been with you, so we said, 'Let there now be an oath between us—between you and us—and let us make a covenant with you  
29 that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now blessed by the LORD.'"  
30 So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.  
31 In the morning they rose early and swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them off, and they departed from him in peace.

32 That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well they had dug, saying to him, "We have found water."  
33 He named it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.

34 When Esau was forty years old, he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.  
35 They made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.


Chapter 27

1 When Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, he called his older son Esau and said to him, "My son." Esau replied, "Here I am."  
2 Isaac said, "See now, I am old, and I do not know the day of my death.  
3 Now then, take your weapons—your quiver and your bow—and go out to the open country to hunt game for me.  
4 Prepare for me the kind of tasty food I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat it and bless you before I die."

5 Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau went out to the field to hunt game and bring it back,  
6 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Look, I heard your father say to your brother Esau,  
7 'Bring me some game and prepare me a tasty meal so that I may eat and bless you before the LORD before I die.'  
8 Now, my son, obey me and do what I tell you:  
9 Go now to the flock and bring me two choice young goats so I can prepare from them a dish your father loves.  
10 Then you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies."

11 But Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, "My brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a man with smooth skin.  
12 Suppose my father touches me—then I will be found out as a deceiver and bring a curse on myself rather than a blessing."  
13 His mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey me and go get them for me."  
14 So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared a tasty dish, just the way his father liked it.

15 Rebekah took the best garments of her older son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.  
16 She put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.  
17 Then she placed in the hands of her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had prepared.

18 He went to his father and said, "My father." Isaac replied, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?"  
19 Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat of my game, so that you may bless me."  
20 But Isaac said to his son, "How did you find it so quickly, my son?" He answered, "Because the LORD your God gave me success."  
21 Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not."  
22 So Jacob went near to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau."  
23 He did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau, so he blessed him.  
24 He asked, "Are you really my son Esau?" He answered, "I am."  
25 Then Isaac said, "Bring it to me so that I may eat of my son's game and bless you." So he brought it to him, and he ate. He also brought him wine, and he drank.

26 Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come near and kiss me, my son."  
27 So he came near and kissed him, and Isaac smelled the scent of his garments and blessed him. He said,  
"See, the scent of my son  
is like the scent of a field  
that the LORD has blessed.  
28 May God give you from the dew of the heavens  
and from the richness of the earth,  
an abundance of grain and new wine.  
29 May nations serve you  
and peoples bow down to you.  
Be lord over your brothers,  
and may your mother's sons bow down to you.  
Cursed be those who curse you,  
and blessed be those who bless you."

30 Just as Isaac finished blessing Jacob and Jacob had scarcely left his father's presence, Esau his brother came in from hunting.  
31 He also prepared a tasty dish and brought it to his father and said, "Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, so that you may bless me."  
32 His father Isaac said to him, "Who are you?" He answered, "I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."  
33 Then Isaac trembled violently and said, "Who then was it who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it all before you came, and I blessed him—and he will certainly be blessed."

34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me—me too, my father!"  
35 But Isaac said, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing."  
36 Esau said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times: he took my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing." Then he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"  
37 Isaac answered Esau, "Look, I have made him lord over you, and I have given all his brothers to him as servants. I have sustained him with grain and wine. What then can I do for you, my son?"  
38 Esau said to his father, "Do you only have one blessing, my father? Bless me—me too, my father!" And Esau lifted his voice and wept.

39 Then his father Isaac answered him and said,  
"See, your dwelling shall be  
away from the richness of the earth,  
and away from the dew of the heavens above.  
40 You shall live by your sword,  
and you shall serve your brother.  
But when you become restless,  
you will break his yoke from your neck."

41 So Esau harbored hatred toward Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. Esau said in his heart, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob."  
42 When the words of her older son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she sent and called her younger son Jacob and said to him, "See, your brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you.  
43 Now, my son, listen to me. Get up and flee to my brother Laban in Haran.  
44 Stay with him for a while until your brother's anger subsides.
45 When your brother's fury turns away and he forgets what you did to him, then I will send and bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?"

46 Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am sick of my life because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the daughters of Heth like these, from among the women of this land, what good is my life to me?"


Chapter 28

1 Then Isaac summoned Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, saying, "You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.  
2 Get up, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father, and take for yourself a wife from there, from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.  
3 May God Almighty bless you, make you fruitful, and multiply you, so that you may become a company of peoples.  
4 May he give to you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you, so that you may take possession of the land of your sojourning, which God gave to Abraham."  
5 So Isaac sent Jacob off, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.

6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there—and that as he blessed him he commanded him, saying, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan"—  
7 and when Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram,  
8 Esau realized that the daughters of Canaan were displeasing to his father Isaac.  
9 So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, the sister of Nebaioth, as a wife, in addition to the wives he already had.

10 Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran.  
11 He came to a certain place and spent the night there because the sun had set. He took one of the stones from the place, put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.  
12 He dreamed, and behold, a stairway was set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. The angels of God were going up and coming down on it.  
13 And behold, the Lord was standing beside him and said, "I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. I will give to you and to your offspring the land on which you lie.  
14 Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. Through you and through your offspring all the families of the earth shall be blessed.  
15 Behold, I am with you, and I will keep you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."

16 Jacob woke from his sleep and said, "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it."  
17 And he was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."

18 So Jacob rose early in the morning, took the stone he had placed under his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it.  
19 He named that place Bethel, though formerly the name of the city was Luz.  
20 Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will keep me on this journey that I am taking, and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear,  
21 so that I return in peace to my father's house, then the Lord shall be my God.  
22 And this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that you give me, I will surely give a tenth to you."


Chapter 29

1 Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the people of the east.  
2 He looked and saw a well in the open field, with three flocks of sheep lying beside it, because the flocks were watered from that well. A large stone covered the mouth of the well.  
3 When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the well's mouth, water the sheep, and then return the stone to its place over the well's opening.

4 Jacob said to them, "My brothers, where are you from?" They answered, "We're from Haran."  
5 He asked them, "Do you know Laban, Nahor's grandson?" They said, "Yes, we know him."  
6 He asked them, "Is he well?" They replied, "He's well—and look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep."

7 He said, "Look, it's still broad daylight—it's not time to gather the livestock. Water the sheep, and take them back out to graze."  
8 But they said, "We can't until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep."

9 While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, since she was a shepherdess.  
10 When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban's sheep, he went over and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle Laban's sheep.  
11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.  
12 Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's relative, the son of Rebekah. She ran and told her father.

13 As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him. He embraced him, kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all that had happened.  
14 Then Laban said to him, "Surely you are my own flesh and blood." Jacob stayed with him for a month.

15 Then Laban said to Jacob, "Just because you're my relative, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be."  
16 Now Laban had two daughters: the older one was named Leah, and the younger one was Rachel.  
17 Leah had delicate eyes, but Rachel had a beautiful figure and an attractive appearance.  
18 Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, "I'll serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."  
19 Laban said, "It's better that I give her to you than to another man. Stay here with me."  
20 So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.

21 Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my time is completed, and I want to be with her."  
22 So Laban gathered all the men of the place and held a feast.  
23 But in the evening, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob slept with her.  
24 Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maid.  
25 In the morning, Jacob saw that it was Leah, and said to Laban, "What is this you've done to me? Didn't I serve you for Rachel? Why have you deceived me?"

26 Laban replied, "It's not the custom in our place to marry off a younger daughter before the firstborn.  
27 Finish this bridal week, and then we'll give you the other one also—for another seven years of work."  
28 Jacob agreed and completed the week with Leah. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.  
29 Laban gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid.  
30 Jacob slept with Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. He served Laban for another seven years.

31 When the Lord saw that Leah was unloved, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.  
32 Leah conceived and bore a son, and she named him Reuben, for she said, "The Lord has seen my affliction; surely now my husband will love me."  
33 She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and said, "Because the Lord heard that I am unloved, he gave me this one also." So she named him Simeon.  
34 She conceived again and bore a son and said, "Now at last my husband will be attached to me, because I've borne him three sons." So he was named Levi.  
35 She conceived once more and bore a son, and she said, "This time I will praise the Lord." Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.


Chapter 30

1 When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she became envious of her sister and said to Jacob, "Give me children, or I shall die!"  
2 Jacob's anger burned against Rachel, and he said, "Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"  
3 Then she said, "Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, so that she may bear children on my behalf, and I too may have a family through her."  
4 So she gave him Bilhah her servant as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.  
5 Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.  
6 Then Rachel said, "God has vindicated me; He has heard my voice and has given me a son." Therefore she named him Dan.  
7 Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.  
8 Then Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed." So she named him Naphtali.

9 When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.  
10 Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.  
11 Then Leah said, "Good fortune has come!" So she named him Gad.  
12 Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.  
13 Then Leah said, "How happy I am! For women will call me blessed." So she named him Asher.

14 During the wheat harvest, Reuben went out and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."  
15 But Leah replied, "Is it not enough that you have taken my husband? Now you also want to take my son's mandrakes?" So Rachel said, "Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes."  
16 When Jacob came in from the field that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he lay with her that night.  
17 God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.  
18 Then Leah said, "God has given me my wages because I gave my servant to my husband." So she named him Issachar.  
19 Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.  
20 Then Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good gift; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons." So she named him Zebulun.  
21 Afterwards she bore a daughter and named her Dinah.

22 Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb.  
23 She conceived and bore a son and said, "God has taken away my reproach."  
24 And she named him Joseph, saying, "May the LORD add to me another son."

25 After Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place and my own country.  
26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go, for you know the service that I have rendered you."  
27 But Laban said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you."  
28 He continued, "Name your wages, and I will give it."  
29 Jacob said to him, "You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock has fared with me.  
30 For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now, when shall I also provide for my own household?"  
31 So Laban said, "What shall I give you?" Jacob answered, "You shall give me nothing. If you will do this one thing for me, I will again pasture your flock and keep it:  
32 Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep, and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and they shall be my wages.  
33 So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to inspect my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled or spotted among the goats, and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be considered stolen."  
34 Laban said, "Good! Let it be as you have said."  
35 But that same day he removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and he put them in the charge of his sons.  
36 And he set a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban's flocks.

37 Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar, almond, and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white of the rods.  
38 He set the rods that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink, and they mated when they came to drink.  
39 So the flocks mated before the rods, and the flocks bore young that were striped, speckled, and spotted.  
40 Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban. He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban's flock.  
41 Whenever the stronger of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might mate among the rods,  
42 but for the feebler animals he did not put them there. So the feebler were Laban's and the stronger were Jacob's.  
43 Thus the man grew exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks, female and male servants, camels, and donkeys.


Chapter 31

1 Now Jacob heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken all that belonged to our father, and from what was our father's he has gained all this wealth."
2 Jacob also saw that Laban's face was not favorable toward him as before.
3 Then the Lord said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you."

4 So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field where his flock was,
5 and said to them, "I see that your father's attitude toward me is not as it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.
6 You yourselves know that I have served your father with all my strength.
7 Yet your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to harm me.
8 If he said, 'The speckled shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled lambs; and if he said, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore striped lambs.
9 Thus God has taken away your father's livestock and given them to me.

10 "In the mating season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the male goats mating with the flock were striped, speckled, and spotted.
11 Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.'
12 And he said, 'Lift up your eyes and see: all the male goats that are mating with the flock are striped, speckled, and spotted, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.
13 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to Me. Now arise, leave this land and return to the land of your kindred.'"

14 Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, "Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father's house?
15 Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us and has also entirely consumed our purchase price.
16 Surely all the wealth that God has taken from our father belongs to us and our children. Now then, do whatever God has said to you."

17 So Jacob rose up and put his sons and his wives on camels.
18 He drove away all his livestock and all the possessions he had acquired, the livestock in his possession that he had gained in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac, his father, in the land of Canaan.

19 Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole the household idols that belonged to her father.
20 Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing.
21 So he fled with all that he had; he arose, crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.

22 On the third day, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
23 So he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days' journey, and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.
24 But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, "Take care not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."

25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen camped in the hill country of Gilead.
26 Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have deceived me and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?
27 Why did you flee secretly and deceive me, and not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with tambourine and lyre?
28 And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell. Now you have done foolishly.
29 It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take care not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'
30 Now, you have gone away because you longed for your father's house, but why have you stolen my gods?"

31 Jacob answered and said to Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.
32 But anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen, point out what I have that is yours and take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.

33 So Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two female servants, but he found nothing. Then he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's tent.
34 Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel's saddle and sat on them. Laban searched all the tent but did not find them.
35 She said to her father, "Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me." So he searched, but did not find the household idols.

36 Then Jacob became angry and argued with Laban. Jacob said to Laban, "What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?
37 For you have searched through all my possessions, and what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may judge between us two.

38 "These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flock.
39 That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you demanded it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
40 Thus I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and sleep fled from my eyes.

41 "These twenty years I have been in your house: I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times.
42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."

43 Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the sons are my sons, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne?
44 So now, come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me."

45 So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
46 And Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones." So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
47 Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
48 And Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." Therefore its name was called Galeed,
49 and Mizpah, for he said, "The Lord watch between you and me, when we are out of one another's sight.
50 If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, though no man is with us, see—God is witness between you and me."

51 Then Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap and the pillar which I have set between you and me.
52 This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, to harm.
53 The God of Abraham and the god of Nahor, the god of their father, judge between us." So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.
54 Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.

55 Early in the morning, Laban rose and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his place.


Chapter 32

1 As Jacob went on his way, the angels of God met him.
2 When he saw them, Jacob said, "This is God's camp!" So he called that place Mahanaim.

3 Then Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to Esau, his brother, in the land of Seir, the territory of Edom.
4 He instructed them, saying, "This is what you shall say to my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says this: I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now.
5 I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent word to tell my lord, so that I may find favor in your sight.'"

6 The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and he is also coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him."
7 Then Jacob was very afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two camps.
8 For he thought, "If Esau comes to the one camp and strikes it, then the other camp will escape."

9 Then Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your kindred, and I will bless you,'
10 I am not worthy of all the kindness and faithfulness that You have shown to Your servant. For with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
11 Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he may come and strike me down, the mothers with the children.
12 Yet You Yourself said, 'I will surely bless you, and make your offspring like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'"

13 He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he took a gift for his brother Esau:
14 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
15 thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
16 He put them in the care of his servants, each drove by itself, and said to his servants, "Go on ahead of me, and put some distance between each drove."

17 He commanded the first, saying, "When Esau my brother meets you and asks, 'To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose animals are these ahead of you?'
18 then you shall say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. It is a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he himself is behind us.'"
19 He also commanded the second and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, "You shall speak the same words to Esau when you find him.
20 And you shall say, 'Your servant Jacob is behind us.'" For he said, "I will appease him with the gift that goes ahead of me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me."
21 So the gift passed ahead of him, and he himself spent the night in the camp.

22 That night he rose, took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
23 He took them and sent them across the stream, along with everything else that he had.
24 And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the break of day.
25 When he saw that he could not prevail against him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip, and the socket of Jacob's hip was dislocated as he wrestled with him.

26 Then he said, "Let me go, for the day has broken." But Jacob said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
27 So he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob."
28 Then he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed."

29 Then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." But he said, "Why do you ask my name?" And there he blessed him.
30 So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, "For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been preserved."

31 The sun rose upon him as he passed Peniel, limping because of his hip.
32 Therefore to this day the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the socket of the hip, because he touched the socket of Jacob's hip at the sinew of the thigh.


Chapter 33

1 Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming, and with him were four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.  
2 He placed the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph last.  
3 He himself went on ahead of them and bowed to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.  

4 But Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him, and they wept.  
5 When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, "Who are these with you?" Jacob answered, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."  
6 Then the maidservants came forward, they and their children, and bowed down.  
7 Leah also came forward with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel came forward, and they bowed down.  

8 Esau said, "What do you mean by all this company that I met?" He replied, "To find favor in the eyes of my lord."  
9 But Esau said, "I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself."  
10 Jacob said, "No, please. If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from my hand. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, since you have received me favorably.  
11 Please take my blessing that has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have everything I need." So he urged him, and he took it.  

12 Then Esau said, "Let us journey on our way, and I will go ahead of you."  
13 But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are frail, and the flocks and herds that are nursing are a concern to me. If they are driven hard for a single day, all the livestock will die.  
14 Let my lord go ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly at the pace of the livestock that goes before me and the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."  

15 Esau said, "Let me leave with you some of the men who are with me." But he replied, "Why do that? Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."  
16 So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.  
17 But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and he built himself a house and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.  

18 And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-Aram; and he camped before the city.  
19 He bought the parcel of land where he had pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money.  
20 There he set up an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.


Chapter 34

1 Now Dinah, the daughter whom Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.  
2 Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, took her, lay with her, and violated her.  
3 His soul was drawn to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.  
4 So Shechem said to his father Hamor, "Get me this girl as a wife."

5 Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter, but his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob kept silent until they came in.  
6 Then Hamor, the father of Shechem, went out to Jacob to speak with him.  
7 When Jacob's sons heard about it, they came in from the field. The men were grieved and very angry, because he had committed a disgraceful act in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter—for such a thing ought not to be done.  
8 But Hamor spoke with them, saying, "My son Shechem's soul longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.  
9 Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves.  
10 You shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you; settle and trade in it, and acquire property in it."  
11 Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.  
12 Name the bride-price and dowry as high as you like, and I will give whatever you ask of me; only give me the young woman as a wife."

13 Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor with deceit, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.  
14 They said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.  
15 Only on this condition will we agree with you—that you become like us by every male among you being circumcised.  
16 Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves; we will dwell with you and become one people.  
17 But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go."

18 Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor's son Shechem.  
19 The young man did not delay to do what they asked, because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father.  
20 So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,  
21 "These men are at peace with us. Let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is broad enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives, and let us give them our daughters.  
22 Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us and become one people—that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised.  
23 Will not their livestock, their property, and all their animals be ours? Let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us."  
24 And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.

25 Now on the third day, when they were in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword, came upon the city unopposed, and killed every male.  
26 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.  
27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled.  
28 They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field.  
29 All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and looted.

30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. My men are few in number, and if they gather against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household."  
31 But they said, "Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?"


Chapter 35

1 Then God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there, and build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."

2 So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Remove the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments.
3 Let us arise and go up to Bethel, and I will build an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me on the way that I went."
4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings that were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak that was near Shechem.

5 Then they set out, and the terror of God was upon the cities around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
6 And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.
7 And there he built an altar and called the place El-Bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.

8 And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and he called its name Allon-bacuth.

9 Then God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and he blessed him.
10 And God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name." So he called his name Israel.

11 And God said to him, "I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and an assembly of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body.
12 And the land that I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, I will give to you, and I will give the land to your descendants after you."
13 Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.

14 So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering on it and poured oil on it.
15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.

16 Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor.
17 And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, "Do not be afraid, for you have another son."
18 And as her breath was departing (for she died), she called his name Ben-oni, but his father called him Benjamin.

19 So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
20 And Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.

21 Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
22 And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it.

Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
23 The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun.
24 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
25 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali.
26 The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.

27 And Jacob came to Isaac, his father, at Mamre, at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
28 Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.
29 And Isaac breathed his last, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.


Chapter 36

1 These are the generations of Esau (that is, Edom).  
2 Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,  
3 and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth.  
4 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel,  
5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.  

6 Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, along with his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions that he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went to a land away from his brother Jacob.  
7 For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their sojournings could not support them because of their livestock.  
8 So Esau settled in the hill country of Seir. Esau is Edom.  

9 These are the generations of Esau, the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.  
10 These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.  
11 The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.  
12 Timna was a concubine to Eliphaz, Esau's son; she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife.  
13 These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.  
14 These were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.  

15 These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau: the chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,  
16 Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; they are the sons of Adah.  
17 These are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: the chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom; they are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.  
18 These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: the chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the chiefs born of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.  
19 These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.  

20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,  
21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom.  
22 The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam, and Lotan's sister was Timna.  
23 These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.  
24 These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of Zibeon his father.  
25 These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah.  
26 These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.  
27 These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.  
28 These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.  

29 These are the chiefs of the Horites: the chiefs Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,  
30 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.  

31 These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Israel:  
32 Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.  
33 When Bela died, Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his place.  
34 When Jobab died, Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.  
35 When Husham died, Hadad the son of Bedad, who struck down Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place. The name of his city was Avith.  
36 When Hadad died, Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place.  
37 When Samlah died, Shaul of Rehoboth on the Euphrates reigned in his place.  
38 When Shaul died, Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place.  
39 When Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, Hadar reigned in his place. The name of his city was Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.  

40 These are the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their clans and places, by their names: the chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,  
41 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,  
42 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,  
43 Magdiel, and Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their dwellings in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of Edom.


Chapter 37

1 Jacob settled in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan.

2 This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers. He was a youth with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father.

3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a long-sleeved tunic.  
4 But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.

5 Then Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.  
6 He said to them, "Please listen to this dream I had:  
7 So, we were binding sheaves in the field, and it happened that my sheaf rose up and stood upright, and then your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf."  
8 His brothers said to him, "Will you really reign over us? Or will you truly have authority over us?" So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.

9 Then he dreamed again, and told it to his brothers, saying, "Hey, I had another dream: this time, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."  
10 But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, "What is this that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down to the ground before you?"  
11 And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.

12 Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near Shechem.  
13 And Israel said to Joseph, "Aren't your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." And he said to him, "Here I am."  
14 Then he said to him, "Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word." So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

15 A man found him wandering in the field, and the man asked him, "What are you seeking?"  
16 And he said, "I am looking for my brothers; please tell me where they are pasturing the flock."  
17 The man said, "They have moved on from here, for I heard them say, 'Let's go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.

18 They saw him from a distance, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.  
19 They said to one another, "Look out, here comes the dreamer.  
20 Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits. Then we will say a wild beast has devoured him, and then we will see what will become of his dreams."

21 But Reuben heard it and rescued him out of their hands. He said, "Let's not kill him."  
22 And Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood; instead, throw him into this pit in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him." He intended to rescue him out of their hand, and restore him to his father.

23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long-sleeved tunic that he wore.  
24 And they took him and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.

25 Then they sat down to eat. And looking up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.  
26 Then Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?  
27 Instead, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let it not be our hand that is upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh." And his brothers agreed.

28 Then Midianite traders passed by, and they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt.

29 When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his garments.  
30 He returned to his brothers and said, "The boy is gone, and I—where shall I go?"

31 Then they took Joseph's robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the tunic in the blood.  
32 And they sent the long-sleeved tunic and brought it to their father and said, "We found this; please identify whether it is your son's tunic or not."  
33 And he recognized it and said, "It is my son's tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces."

34 Then Jacob tore his garments and put on sackcloth, and mourned for his son for many days.  
35 All his sons and all his daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, "No, I shall go down to the grave, mourning for my son." Thus his father wept for him.

36 Meanwhile, the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.


Chapter 38

1 At that time Judah departed from his brothers and settled near a man of Adullam named Hirah.  
2 Judah saw there the daughter of a certain Canaanite man named Shua. He took her and went in to her,  
3 and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.  
4 She conceived again and bore a son, and she named him Onan.  
5 Then she bore yet another son, and she named him Shelah. He was in Kezib when she bore him.

6 Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.  
7 But Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death.  
8 Then Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother."  
9 But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his, so whenever he went in to his brother's wife, he would spill his seed on the ground, in order not to give offspring to his brother.  
10 What he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also.  
11 Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up." For he thought, "He too might die, like his brothers." So Tamar went and lived in her father's house.

12 After a considerable time Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had finished mourning, he went up to the sheep shearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.  
13 And Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."  
14 So she took off her widow's garments, covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah had grown up, yet she had not been given to him as a wife.  
15 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.  
16 He turned aside to her by the road and said, "Come now, let me come in to you," for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"  
17 He said, "I will send you a young goat from the flock." She said, "Only if you give me a pledge until you send it."  
18 He said, "What pledge shall I give you?" She replied, "Your seal and your cord and the staff that is in your hand." So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.  
19 Then she arose and went away. She took off her veil and put on her widow's garments again.

20 Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite, to retrieve the pledge from the woman's hand, but he did not find her.  
21 He asked the men of that place, "Where is the cult prostitute who was at Enaim by the road?" They said, "No cult prostitute has been here."  
22 So he returned to Judah and said, "I did not find her. Moreover, the men of the place said, 'No cult prostitute has been here.'"  
23 Then Judah said, "Let her keep the things for herself, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her."

24 About three months later, Judah was told, "Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot, and she is even pregnant by her harlotry." Then Judah said, "Bring her out and let her be burned."  
25 As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law: "The man to whom these belong made me pregnant." And she said, "Please examine and see whose these are—the seal, and the cord, and the staff."  
26 Then Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not lie with her again.

27 When the time came for her to give birth, behold, there were twins in her womb.  
28 As she gave birth, one put out his hand, and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his hand, saying, "This one came out first."  
29 But as he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" So he was named Perez.  
30 Afterward his brother came out, the one who had the scarlet thread on his hand, and he was named Zerah.


Chapter 39

1 Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.
2 The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man. He was in the house of his Egyptian master.
3 His master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD made all that he did prosper in his hand.
4 So Joseph found favor in his eyes and served him, and he made him overseer of his house and put everything he owned into his hand.
5 From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake. The blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.
6 So he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and with him there he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.

7 And after these things, his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, "Lie with me."
8 But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Look, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house because of me, and he has put everything that he owns into my hand.
9 There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has not withheld anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil and sin against God?"

10 Though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie with her or to be with her.
11 One day he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house were there inside.
12 She grabbed him by his garment and said, "Lie with me!" But he left his garment in her hand and fled and ran outside.

13 When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,
14 she called the men of her house and said to them, "Look, he brought us a Hebrew to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I screamed.
15 And when he heard that I lifted up my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled and went outside."

16 She kept his garment beside her until his master came home.
17 Then she spoke to him with these words: "The Hebrew slave you brought to us came in to me to mock me.
18 But as I lifted up my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled outside."

19 When his master heard the words his wife spoke to him, saying, "This is what your servant did to me," his anger burned.
20 So Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined. And he was there in the prison.

21 But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favor in the eyes of the warden of the prison.
22 And the warden put all the prisoners who were in the prison under Joseph's care. Whatever was done there, he was the one doing it.
23 The warden did not pay attention to anything that was in Joseph's hand, because the LORD was with him, and whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed.


Chapter 40

1 After these events, the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.  
2 Pharaoh became angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,  
3 and he placed them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.  
4 The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended to them; they were in custody for some time.

5 Now both of them, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, had a dream the same night—each his own dream with its own interpretation.  
6 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled.  
7 So he asked Pharaoh's officials who were with him in custody in his master's house, "Why are your faces downcast today?"  
8 They said to him, "We have had a dream, and there is no one to interpret it." Then Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me."

9 So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, "In my dream, there was a vine in front of me,  
10 and on the vine were three branches. As it was budding, its blossoms came out, and its clusters ripened into grapes.  
11 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."  
12 Then Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.  
13 Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you will place Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.  
14 But remember me when it goes well with you, and please show kindness to me by mentioning me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this house.  
15 For I was certainly stolen from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit."

16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, "I also saw in my dream that there were three baskets of white bread on my head.  
17 In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, and birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."  
18 Then Joseph answered and said, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.  
19 Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head—from off you—and will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh from you."

20 Now on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.  
21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand,  
22 but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.  
23 Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.


Chapter 41

1 Two full years later, Pharaoh had a dream: he was standing by the Nile,
2 and there came up out of the Nile seven cows, attractive and plump, and they grazed among the reeds.
3 Then seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, ugly and thin, and stood beside the other cows on the bank of the Nile.
4 The ugly and thin cows ate up the seven attractive and plump cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.

5 He fell asleep again and dreamed a second time. Seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.
6 Then, behold, seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted after them.
7 The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and it was a dream.

8 In the morning his spirit was troubled. He sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.

9 Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I remember my offenses today.
10 When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, he put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard.
11 We both had dreams on the same night, each dream with its own interpretation.
12 A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams for us, giving each man an interpretation according to his dream.
13 And just as he interpreted for us, so it came to pass. I was restored to my office, and the other was hanged."

14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the jail. When he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.
15 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream, you can interpret it."
16 Joseph answered Pharaoh, "It is not in me; but it is God who will give Pharaoh a favorable answer."

17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile.
18 Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and grazed among the reeds.
19 Then seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin—such ugliness as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt.
20 And the thin and ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows.
21 But when they had eaten them, no one would have known they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke.

22 "I also saw in my dream seven ears of grain growing on one stalk, full and good.
23 Then seven ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted after them.
24 And the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. I told this to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."

25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one.
27 The seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears scorched by the east wind are also seven years of famine.
28 It is as I told Pharaoh: God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.

29 "Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming throughout all the land of Egypt.
30 But after them will come seven years of famine, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,
31 and the abundance in the land will not be remembered because of the famine that follows, for it will be very severe.
32 The doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

33 "Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt.
34 Let Pharaoh act, and appoint overseers over the land, and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plentiful years.
35 And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under Pharaoh's authority for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
36 That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine."

37 This proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.
38 And Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this, in whom is the spirit of God?"
39 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are.
40 You shall be over my house, and all my people shall submit themselves according to your command. Only as it pertains to the throne will I be greater than you."

41 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Now, I am setting you over all the land of Egypt."
42 Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.
43 And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, "Bow the knee!" Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.

44 Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without your permission no man shall lift hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, as a wife. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.

46 Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh's presence and passed through all the land of Egypt.
47 During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly.
48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which occurred in the land of Egypt and stored the food in the cities. He stored up in every city the food from the fields surrounding it.
49 And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring it, for it could not be measured.

50 Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him.
51 Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, for he said, "God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house."
52 The name of the second he called Ephraim, for he said, "God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."

53 The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end,
54 and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
55 When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph. Do what he tells you."

56 So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
57 Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.


Chapter 42

1 When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why are you just standing around looking at each other?"  
2 He said, "Look, I've heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us from that place, so that we may live and not die."  

3 Then ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.  
4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers, "Lest harm come to him," he said.  
5 So the sons of Israel came to buy grain among others who were going, for the famine was in the land of Canaan also.  

6 Now Joseph was the governor over the land; he was the one selling grain to all the people of the land. So when Joseph's brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground,  
7 and Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them. But he acted like a stranger toward them and spoke harshly with them. He said to them, "Where do you come from?" And they said, "From the land of Canaan to buy food."  
8 Though Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.  
9 Then Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them, and he said to them, "You are spies! You've come to see where the land is vulnerable."  

10 But they said to him, "No, my lord! Your servants have come to buy food.  
11 We are all sons of one man. We are honest men; your servants are not spies."  

12 But he said to them, "No! You have come to see where the land is vulnerable."  
13 And they said, "Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more."  

14 But Joseph said to them, "It is just as I said to you: you are spies.  
15 Here is how you will be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.  
16 Send one of you to bring your brother, and the rest of you will be kept under guard, so that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Otherwise, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies."  
17 Then he put them all together in custody for three days.  

18 On the third day Joseph said to them, "Do this and live, for I fear God.  
19 If you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined in prison, and the rest of you go, bring grain to your households for the famine.  
20 But bring your youngest brother to me. In this way your words will be verified, and you shall not die." And they did so.  

21 Then they said to one another, "Surely we are guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, and we would not listen. That is why this trouble has come upon us."  
22 Reuben answered them, saying, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not sin against the boy'? But you would not listen, and now his blood is required of us."  
23 They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them.  
24 Then he turned away from them and wept. When he returned to them, he spoke to them and took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.  

25 Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to return each man's silver to his sack and to give them provisions for the journey. And it was done for them.  
26 So they loaded their grain on their donkeys and departed from there.  

27 When one of them opened his sack at the lodging place to give feed to his donkey, he saw his silver—there, in the mouth of his sack.  
28 He said to his brothers, "My silver has been returned, here in my sack!" Then their hearts failed them, and trembling, they said to one another, "What has God done to us?"  

29 When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,  
30 "The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly with us and took us for spies of the land.  
31 But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies.  
32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is with our father this day in the land of Canaan.'  
33 Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I shall know that you are honest: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain to your families for the famine. And go!  
34 But bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men. I will give your brother back to you, and you may trade in the land.'"  

35 And it came about as they were emptying their sacks, that there in each man's sack was his pouch of silver. When they and their father saw the pouches of silver, they were afraid.  
36 And Jacob their father said to them, "You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come upon me!"  
37 Then Reuben said to his father, "You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hand, and I will bring him back to you."  
38 But he said, "My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If harm should befall him on the journey that you are taking, then you will bring my gray head in sorrow to the grave."


Chapter 43

1 Now the famine was severe in the land.  
2 When they had finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go back and buy us a little food."  
3 But Judah said to him, "The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'  
4 If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.  
5 But if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'"  
6 Then Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?"  
7 They replied, "The man asked us carefully about ourselves and our family, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' So we answered him according to these words. How could we know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?"  
8 Then Judah said to his father Israel, "Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, so that we may live and not die—both we and you and also our little ones.  
9 I will be a pledge for his safety; from my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then I shall bear the blame forever.  
10 For if we had not delayed, we would by now have returned twice."

11 Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice products of the land in your bags and carry them down to the man as a gift—a little balm and a little honey, gum resin and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.  
12 Take double the silver with you, and carry back the silver that was returned in the mouth of your sacks—perhaps it was a mistake.  
13 Take your brother also, and arise, go back to the man.  
14 May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother and Benjamin. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved."

15 So the men took this gift, and double the silver with them, and Benjamin. They arose, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.  
16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal, and make ready, for the men shall dine with me at noon."  
17 The man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph's house.
18 And the men were afraid when they were brought into Joseph's house. They said, "It is because of the silver that was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are being brought in, so that he may assault us and fall upon us and make us servants and seize our donkeys."  
19 So they approached the steward of Joseph's house and spoke to him at the entrance of the house,  
20 and said, "Please, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food.  
21 But when we came to the lodging place and opened our sacks, behold, each man's silver was in the mouth of his sack—our silver in full weight. So we have brought it back with us.  
22 And we have brought other silver with us to buy food. We do not know who put our silver in our sacks."  
23 He replied, "Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your silver." Then he brought Simeon out to them.

24 Then the man brought the men into Joseph's house and gave them water, and they washed their feet, and he gave their donkeys fodder.  
25 They prepared the gift for Joseph's arrival at noon, for they had heard that they would eat there.  
26 When Joseph came into the house, they brought him the gift that they had with them and bowed down before him to the ground.  
27 He asked them about their welfare and said, "Is your aged father well, the one of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"  
28 They said, "Your servant our father is well; he is still alive." And they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.  
29 Then he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?" Then he said, "May God be gracious to you, my son."  
30 Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. He went into a chamber and wept there.

31 Then he washed his face and came out. Controlling himself, he said, "Serve the meal."  
32 They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, for the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.  
33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment.  
34 He took portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.


Chapter 44

1 Then he commanded the steward of his house, saying, "Fill the men's sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man's silver in the mouth of his sack.
2 And put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, along with the silver for his grain." And he did as Joseph had spoken.

3 At morning light the men were sent off, they and their donkeys.
4 They had gone only a short distance from the city when Joseph said to his steward, "Get up, pursue the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid good with evil?
5 Is not this the cup from which my master drinks and by which he indeed practices divination? You have done evil in what you have done.'"

6 When he overtook them, he spoke these words to them.
7 But they said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing.
8 Look, the silver that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your master's house?
9 Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will become slaves to my lord."

10 And he said, "Now also let it be according to your words: he who is found with it shall be my slave, and the rest of you shall be innocent."
11 Then they quickly lowered each man his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
12 And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
13 Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city.

14 When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there, and they fell before him to the ground.
15 And Joseph said to them, "What is this deed you have done? Did you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?"

16 Then Judah said, "What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we justify ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants. Look, we are my lord's slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup was found."

17 But he said, "Far be it from me to do this. The man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my slave. But you—go up in peace to your father."

18 Then Judah approached him and said, "Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord, and do not be angry with your servant, for you are as Pharaoh.
19 My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'
20 And we said to my lord, 'We have an aged father and a young boy born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.'

21 Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me so that I may set my eyes on him.'
22 But we said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father, for if he leaves his father, he will die.'
23 But you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not see my face again.'

24 And it happened when we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
25 Then our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food.'
26 But we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down. For we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'

27 Then your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.
28 And the one went out from me, and I said, "Surely he has been torn to pieces," and I have not seen him since.
29 If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to the grave.'

30 Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us, since his life is bound up in the boy's life,
31 it shall happen, when he sees that the boy is not there, that he will die. Then your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father in sorrow to the grave.
32 For your servant became surety for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my days.'

33 Now therefore, please let your servant remain as a slave to my lord in place of the boy, and let the boy go up with his brothers.
34 For how shall I go up to my father if the boy is not with me—lest I see the evil that would come upon my father?"


Chapter 45

1 Then Joseph could no longer restrain himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried, "Have everyone go out from me!" So no man stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
2 And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard of it.

3 Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?" But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
4 And Joseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, please." And they came near. And he said, "I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.
5 But now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
6 For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
7 And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on the earth and to keep many survivors alive.
8 So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. And He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
9 Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, "God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay.
10 You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me—you, and your sons, and your sons' sons, and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have.
11 There I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come, so that you and your household and all that you have do not come to poverty."'
12 And now, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
13 You shall tell my father of all my honor in Egypt and of all that you have seen, and you shall hurry and bring my father down here."

14 Then he fell upon the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.
15 And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. After that, his brothers talked with him.

16 And the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, "Joseph's brothers have come." And it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants.
17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go to the land of Canaan,
18 and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.'
19 And you, Joseph, are commanded to say, 'Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father and come.
20 Do not concern yourselves with your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'"

21 And the sons of Israel did so. And Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.
22 To all of them he gave each man changes of garments, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments.
23 And he sent to his father the following: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provisions for his father on the journey.
24 Then he sent his brothers away, and they departed. And he said to them, "Do not quarrel on the way."

25 So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob, their father.
26 And they told him, saying, "Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt." And his heart grew numb, for he did not believe them.
27 But when they told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.
28 And Israel said, "It is enough. My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."


Chapter 46

1 So Israel set out with all that he had and came to Beersheba, and he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
2 And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, "Jacob, Jacob." And he said, "Here I am."
3 Then He said, "I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there.
4 I Myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I Myself will surely bring you up again; and Joseph shall close your eyes."

5 Then Jacob arose from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob, and their little ones and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
6 They took their livestock and their property, which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him.
7 His sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters—all his offspring—he brought with him to Egypt.

8 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, Jacob and his sons, who came to Egypt: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.
9 And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

10 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.

11 And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

12 And the sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.

13 And the sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron.

14 And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.

15 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, along with his daughter Dinah. All the sons and daughters of his were thirty-three persons.

16 And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.

17 And the sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.

18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah, and she bore these to Jacob—sixteen persons.

19 The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.

20 And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.

21 And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.

22 These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob—fourteen persons in all.

23 And the sons of Dan: Hushim.

24 And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.

25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, and she bore these to Jacob—seven persons in all.

26 All the persons belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt, who were his direct descendants, not counting the wives of Jacob's sons, were sixty-six persons in all.

27 And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two. All the persons of the house of Jacob who came to Egypt were seventy.

28 Now he sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to direct him to Goshen. And they came into the land of Goshen.
29 Then Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. And when he appeared to him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a long time.
30 And Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face and you are still alive."

31 Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me.
32 And the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.'
33 And it shall be, when Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?'
34 that you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,' so that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is detestable to the Egyptians."


Chapter 47

1 Joseph went in and informed Pharaoh, saying, "My father and my brothers have come from the land of Canaan, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, and they are now in the land of Goshen."  
2 He took five men from among his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.  
3 Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?" They said to Pharaoh, "Your servants, both we and our fathers, are shepherds."  
4 They said further to Pharaoh, "We have come to reside temporarily in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now please let your servants settle in the land of Goshen."  
5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.  
6 The land of Egypt is before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them live in the land of Goshen, and if you know of capable men among them, appoint them as overseers of my livestock."

7 Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.  
8 Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many are the years of your life?"  
9 Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty. Few and difficult have been the years of my life, and they have not reached the length of the years of my fathers during their time of sojourning."  
10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.

11 So Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best part of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.  
12 Joseph provided food for his father and his brothers and for all his father's household, according to the number of their dependents.

13 Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.  
14 Joseph collected all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain that they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.  
15 When the money was gone from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, "Give us food! Why should we die in your presence? For our money is gone."  
16 Then Joseph said, "Bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone."  
17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and the flocks and the herds and the donkeys; and he fed them with food that year in exchange for all their livestock.

18 When that year ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, "We cannot hide from my lord that our money is gone, and the livestock is now my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our land.  
19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will become servants to Pharaoh. Provide seed that we may live and not die, and that the land not become desolate."

20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. Thus the land became Pharaoh's.  
21 As for the people, he relocated them to the cities from one end of Egypt's border to the other.  
22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived off that allotment which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore, they did not sell their land.

23 Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.  
24 At harvest you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be yours for seed for the field and for your food and for those of your households and for your little ones."  
25 And they said, "You have saved our lives. May we find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be servants to Pharaoh."  
26 So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh's.

27 Thus Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they acquired property in it and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.  
28 Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven.  
29 When the time of Israel's death drew near, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, place your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,  
30 but let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place." And he said, "I will do as you have said."  
31 Then he said, "Swear to me." So he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself at the head of the bed.


Chapter 48

1 After these things, Joseph was told, "Behold, your father is ill." So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, with him.
2 And it was told to Jacob, "Behold, your son Joseph has come to you." Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed.

3 And Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,
4 and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make you a company of nations, and I will give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.'
5 And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.
6 But your offspring, whom you beget after them, shall be yours. They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.

7 Now as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died to my sorrow in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath. And I buried her there on the way to Ephrath—that is, Bethlehem."

8 When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, "Who are these?"
9 And Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." And he said, "Bring them to me, please, so that I may bless them."

10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age so that he could not see well. So Joseph brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.
11 And Israel said to Joseph, "I did not expect to see your face, and yet, God has let me see your children also."
12 Then Joseph brought them out from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the ground.

13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.
14 But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh—he crossed his hands, for Manasseh was the firstborn.
15 And he blessed Joseph and said,

"The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,
the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
16 the angel who has redeemed me from all evil,
may he bless the boys;
and may my name be named in them,
and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac,
and may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."

17 When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he took hold of his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
18 And Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."
19 But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He too shall become a people, and he too shall be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations."
20 So he blessed them that day, saying,

"By you Israel will pronounce blessing, saying,
'May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.'"

In this way, he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

21 Then Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers.
22 And I give to you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."


Chapter 49

1 Then Jacob called his sons and said, "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come.

2 Assemble and listen, O sons of Jacob, listen to Israel your father.

3 Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the first of my strength, preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.  
4 Unstable as water, you shall not excel, because you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it by going up to my couch.

5 Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of violence are their swords.  
6 Let my soul not enter their council; let not my glory be joined with their assembly. For in their anger they slew a man, and in their willfulness they hamstrung an ox.  
7 Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is cruel. I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.

8 Judah, your brothers shall praise you; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons shall bow down before you.  
9 Judah is a lion's cub; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down, he crouched like a lion and like a lioness—who dares rouse him?  
10 The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs, and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.  
11 Binding his foal to the vine and his donkey's colt to the choice vine, he washes his garments in wine and his robe in the blood of grapes.  
12 His eyes are darker than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.

13 Zebulun shall dwell at the seashore, and he shall be a haven for ships, and his flank shall be toward Sidon.

14 Issachar is a strong-boned donkey, lying down between the sheepfolds.  
15 He saw that a resting place was good, and that the land was pleasant, so he bowed his shoulder to bear a load and became a servant at forced labor.

16 Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.  
17 Dan shall be a serpent by the road, a viper on the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider falls backward.  
18 I wait for your salvation, O Lord.

19 Gad, raiders shall raid him, but he shall raid at their heels.

20 Asher's food shall be rich, and he shall yield royal delicacies.

21 Naphtali is a doe let loose, who gives beautiful words.

22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; his branches run over the wall.  
23 The archers bitterly attacked him, shot at him, and harassed him severely,  
24 yet his bow remained steady, and his arms were agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob—from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel—  
25 by the God of your father who will help you, and by the Almighty who will bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.  
26 The blessings of your father are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than the bounty of the everlasting hills. May they be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him who was set apart from his brothers.

27 Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the spoil.

28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them as he blessed them. He blessed each one according to his own blessing.

29 Then he commanded them and said to them, "I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,  
30 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, the field that Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.  
31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah—  
32 the field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the sons of Heth."  

33 When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.


Chapter 50

1 Then Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept over him and kissed him.  
2 Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.  
3 Forty days were required for him, for that is the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.

4 When the days of mourning for him had passed, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh's household, saying, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,  
5 'My father made me swear, saying, "Behold, I am about to die. In my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me." Now therefore, let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.'"  
6 Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear."

7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. All of Pharaoh's servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt went with him,  
8 as did as all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen.  
9 Both chariots and horsemen went up with him in a very great company.

10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a great and very bitter mourning. He held a mourning ceremony for his father lasting seven days.  
11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians." Therefore its name was called Abel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan river.  
12 Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them,  
13 for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

14 After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.

15 When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph bears a grudge against us and repays us in full for all the evil that we did to him?"  
16 So they sent word to Joseph, saying, "Your father gave this command before he died:  
17 'Say to Joseph, Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did evil to you.' Now please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father." Joseph wept when they spoke to him.  
18 Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said, "Behold, we are your servants."  
19 But Joseph said to them, "Do not fear, for am I in the place of God?  
20 As for you, you intended evil against me, but God intended it for good, to bring about what is now being done—the preservation of many lives.  
21 Now therefore, do not fear. I will provide for you and your little ones." So he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.

22 Joseph remained in Egypt—he and his father's household—and Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.  
23 Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim's sons; the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were also born on Joseph's knees.

24 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die. But God will surely visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."  
25 Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here."  
26 So Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years, and they embalmed him and placed him in a coffin in Egypt.

Exodus

Chapter 1

1 These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each man with his household:  
2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,  
3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,  
4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.  
5 All the persons who came from Jacob’s own body were seventy; but Joseph was already in Egypt.  
6 Then Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.  
7 But the sons of Israel were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.

8 Then a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.  
9 He said to his people, “Behold, the nation of the sons of Israel is more numerous and mightier than we.  
10 Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply further and, in the event of war, join our enemies and fight against us and leave the land.”  
11 So they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built for Pharaoh the store cities of Pithom and Raamses.  
12 But the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread abroad, so that the Egyptians came to dread the sons of Israel.  
13 So the Egyptians harshly enslaved the sons of Israel.  
14 They made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field—every form of service in which they made them serve was done with cruelty.

15 Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,  
16 and he said, “When you attend the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, she shall live.”  
17 But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the boys live.  
18 Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this thing and let the boys live?”  
19 The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.”  
20 So God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and became very strong.  
21 And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.

22 Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every son who is born, you shall cast into the Nile, but every daughter you shall let live.”


Chapter 2

1 A man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a daughter of Levi.  
2 The woman conceived and bore a son. When she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months.  
3 But when she could no longer hide him, she took for him a papyrus basket, coated it with tar and pitch, placed the child inside it, and set it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.  
4 His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.

5 Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the Nile, while her maidens walked along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maidservant, and she took it.  
6 When she opened it, she saw the child—and the boy was crying. She had compassion on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”  
7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a nurse from the Hebrew women for you, that she may nurse the child for you?”  
8 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” So the young girl went and called the child’s mother.  
9 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him.  
10 When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, “Because I drew him out of the water.”

11 In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers to see how they were being mistreated. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.  
12 He looked around, and when he saw that no one was there, he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.  
13 The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He said to the one in the wrong, “Why do you strike your companion?”  
14 The man replied, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and said, “Surely the matter has become known.”  
15 When Pharaoh heard what happened, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, where he sat down by a well.

16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.  
17 Then some shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses came and rescued them and watered their flock.  
18 When they came home to Reuel their father, he said, “Why have you come back so soon today?”  
19 They said, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds, and he even drew water for us and watered the flock.”  
20 He said to his daughters, “Then where is he? Why did you leave the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.”  
21 Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah.  
22 She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, “I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.”

23 Now it came about in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died. The sons of Israel groaned under their bondage and cried out, and their cry for help rose up to God because of their slavery.  
24 God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.  
25 God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice of them.


Chapter 3

1 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
2 The angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire from within a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed.

3 So Moses said, “I will turn aside and see this marvelous sight—why the bush is not burned up.”

4 When the LORD saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.”
5 Then He said, “Do not come any closer. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”
6 And He said, “I am the God of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.

7 Then the LORD said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings,
8 and I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from that land to a good and broad land—a land flowing with milk and honey—to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
9 And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has reached Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them.
10 So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh so that you may bring My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.”

11 But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?”

12 And He said, “I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.”

13 Then Moses said to God, “If I go to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ what shall I say to them?”

14 God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”
15 God also said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel: ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ This is My name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.”
16 “Go and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, “I have surely visited you and seen what has been done to you in Egypt;
17 and I have said that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite—to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’

18 They will listen to your voice, and you shall go—you and the elders of Israel—to the king of Egypt. And you shall say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.’
19 But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.
20 So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders that I will do in its midst. After that, he will let you go.
21 And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. When you go, you will not go empty-handed.
22 Every woman shall ask of her neighbor and of the woman who lives in her house articles of silver and gold and clothing. You shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. Thus you shall plunder the Egyptians.”


Chapter 4

1 Then Moses answered and said, “But suppose they do not believe me or listen to my voice, but say, ‘The LORD has not appeared to you’?”  
2 The LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.”  
3 Then He said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from it.  
4 But the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand and take it by the tail.” So he reached out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand.  
5 “So that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.”  

6 The LORD said further to him, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, white like snow.  
7 Then He said, “Put your hand back inside your cloak.” So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.  
8 “And it will be that, if they do not believe you or heed the voice of the first sign, they may believe the voice of the latter sign.  
9 But if they do not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground, and the water that you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.”  

10 But Moses said to the LORD, “Please, O Lord, I am not a man of words, neither in the past nor since You have spoken to Your servant, for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.”  
11 Then the LORD said to him, “Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?  
12 Now then, go, and I will be with your mouth and will teach you what you shall speak.”  
13 But he said, “Please, O Lord, send someone else.”  
14 Then the anger of the LORD burned against Moses, and He said, “Is there not Aaron your brother, the Levite? I know that he speaks well. And look—he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart.  
15 You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth. And I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you both what to do.  
16 He shall speak for you to the people, and it will be that he will be as a mouth for you, and you will be as God to him.  
17 And you shall take this staff in your hand, with which you will perform the signs.”  

18 Then Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Please let me go, so that I may return to my brothers who are in Egypt and see whether they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”  
19 Now the LORD said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.”  
20 So Moses took his wife and his sons, mounted them on a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.  

21 The LORD said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put in your hand. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.  
22 Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the LORD: Israel is My firstborn son,  
23 and I say to you, Let My son go that he may serve Me. But if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son.’”  

24 Now it happened on the way, at the lodging place, that the LORD met him and sought to put him to death.  
25 Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and touched it to his feet, and she said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”  
26 So He let him alone. At that time she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.  

27 The LORD said to Aaron, “Go to the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.  
28 Then Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to perform.  
29 Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the sons of Israel.  
30 And Aaron spoke all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses, and he performed the signs before the eyes of the people.  
31 And the people believed. And when they heard that the LORD had visited the sons of Israel and that He had seen their affliction, they bowed low and worshiped.


Chapter 5

1 Afterward, Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival for me in the wilderness.’”

2 But Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and I also will not let Israel go.”

3 Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go a three-day journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.”

4 But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their work? Return to your labor!”
5 And Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you would make them rest from their burdens!”
6 That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen,
7 “You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
8 But you shall require of them the same quantity of bricks as they made before; you shall not diminish it. For they are idle—that is why they cry out, saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’
9 Let the work be heavier upon the men, so that they will be occupied with it and not pay attention to deceptive words.”

10 So the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you straw.
11 Go yourselves and get straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced in the least.’”

12 So the people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
13 And the taskmasters pressed them, saying, “Complete your daily work, each day’s task, just as when there was straw.”
14 And the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and asked, “Why have you not completed your required amount of bricks yesterday and today, as before?”

15 Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants?
16 There is no straw given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And behold, your servants are beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”

17 But he said, “You are idle, you are idle! That is why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’
18 Now go and work. Straw will not be given to you, yet you must deliver the same quantity of bricks.”

19 And the foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce your daily number of bricks.”
20 When they left Pharaoh, they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting to meet them,
21 and they said to them, “May the LORD look upon you and judge, because you have made us stink in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”

22 Then Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Lord, why have You brought harm upon this people? Why did You ever send me?
23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has brought harm upon this people, and You have not delivered Your people at all.”


Chapter 6

1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh. For with a strong hand he will let them go, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”

2 God spoke to Moses and said to him, “I am the LORD.
3 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name ‘the LORD’ I was not known to them.
4 I also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as sojourners.
5 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians are holding as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.
6 Therefore say to the sons of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.
7 I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
8 And I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.’”

9 So Moses spoke thus to the sons of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery.

10 Then the LORD said to Moses,
11 “Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land.”
12 But Moses said before the LORD, “Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, for I am of uncertain speach?”

13 But the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a command for the sons of Israel and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

14 These are the heads of their fathers’ houses:

The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the clans of Reuben.

15 The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the clans of Simeon.

16 These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty-seven years.

17 The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, by their clans.

18 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty-three years.

19 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites according to their generations.

20 Amram took Jochebed his father's sister as wife, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the years of the life of Amram were one hundred thirty-seven years.

21 The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.

22 The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.

23 Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, as his wife, and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

24 The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the clans of the Korahites.

25 Eleazar, Aaron’s son, took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers of the Levites by their clans.

26 It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt by their hosts.”
27 They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt—this Moses and this Aaron.

28 And it came to pass, on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
29 the LORD said to Moses, “I am the LORD; speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I tell you.”
30 But Moses said before the LORD, “Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips. How will Pharaoh listen to me?”


Chapter 7

1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “See, I have made you as God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.
2 You shall speak all that I command you, and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he may let the sons of Israel go out of his land.
3 But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt,
4 Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay My hand upon Egypt, and bring out My hosts, My people the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt by great judgments.
5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand over Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst.”

6 So Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded them; thus they did.
7 Now Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.

8 And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
9 “When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Work a wonder,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, and it will become a serpent.’”
10 So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did just as the LORD had commanded. Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

11 Then Pharaoh also summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and they too, the magicians of Egypt, did the same by their secret arts.
12 Each man cast down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.
13 Yet Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.

14 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go.
15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, and station yourself to meet him on the bank of the Nile. And take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent.
16 And you shall say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, “Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness.” But behold, you have not listened until now.’
17 Thus says the LORD: ‘By this you shall know that I am the LORD: observe well, I will strike the water that is in the Nile with the staff that is in my hand, and it shall be turned to blood.
18 And the fish that are in the Nile shall die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will be weary of drinking water from the Nile.’”

19 And the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their canals, over their pools, and over all their reservoirs of water, so that they may become blood. And there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, in vessels of wood and vessels of stone.’”

20 So Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded. He raised the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, and all the water that was in the Nile was turned to blood.
21 And the fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile became foul, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. And there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

22 But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts; so Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.
23 Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not even take this to heart.
24 So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, because they could not drink the water from the Nile.

25 And seven days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.


Chapter 8

1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
2 But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your territory with frogs.
3 The Nile will swarm with frogs, and they will go up and enter your house and into your bedroom and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and kneading bowls.
4 The frogs will come up on you and on your people and on all your servants.’”

5 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and bring up frogs upon the land of Egypt.’”
6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.

7 But the magicians did the same by their secret arts and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

8 Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, “Plead with the LORD to take away the frogs from me and from my people, and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.”

9 Moses said to Pharaoh, “You may have the honor of telling me when I should plead for you and for your servants and for your people, to cause the frogs to be removed from you and from your houses and to remain only in the Nile.”
10 And he said, “Tomorrow.” So he said, “Let it be according to your word, so that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.
11 The frogs shall be removed from you and from your houses and from your servants and from your people; they shall remain only in the Nile.”

12 Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried out to the LORD concerning the frogs which He had brought upon Pharaoh.
13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses: the frogs died out in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.
14 And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.

15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.

16 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground, so that it may become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.’”
17 And they did so. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the ground, and it became gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the ground became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.
18 The magicians tried with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast.
19 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.

20 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, as he goes out to the water, and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
21 For if you do not let My people go, then I will send swarms of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and into your houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms, and also the ground on which they stand.
22 But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people dwell, so that no swarms shall be there, so that you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the land.
23 And I will make a distinction between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall happen.’”

24 And the LORD did so. There came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into the houses of his servants, and throughout all the land of Egypt the land was ruined because of the swarms.
25 Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.”

26 But Moses said, “It is not right to do so, for the sacrifice we offer to the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. If we offer what is detestable in the sight of the Egyptians, will they not stone us?
27 We must go a three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God, just as He has commanded us.”

28 So Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away. Plead for me.”

29 Then Moses said, “Behold, I am going out from you, and I will plead with the LORD that the swarms may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.”
30 So Moses went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the LORD.
31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses: He removed the swarms from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained.

32 But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and did not let the people go.


Chapter 9

1 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh and speak to him: ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, “Send out My people, so that they may serve Me.
2 For if you refuse to send them out and still hold them,
3 then the hand of the Lord will come with a very severe plague upon your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks.
4 But the Lord will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing will die of all that belongs to the sons of Israel.”’”
5 And the Lord set a definite time, saying, “Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land.”
6 So the Lord did this thing on the next day, and all the livestock of Egypt died; but from the livestock of the sons of Israel, not one died.
7 Pharaoh sent men to look, and behold, not even one of the livestock of Israel had died. But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not let the people go.

8 Then the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a kiln, and have Moses scatter it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.
9 It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.”
10 So they took soot from the kiln and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses scattered it toward the sky, and it became boils with sores breaking out on man and beast.
11 The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians.
12 But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not listen to them, just as the Lord had spoken to Moses.

13 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of the Hebrews: “Send out My people, so that they may serve Me.
14 For this time I will send all My plagues upon your own heart, and upon your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like Me in all the earth.
15 For if I had stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with the plague, then you would have been cut off from the earth.
16 But for this very reason I have raised you up, in order to show you My power, and in order that My name might be proclaimed throughout all the earth.
17 Still, you exalt yourself against My people by not letting them go.

18 Behold, at this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall, such as has not been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
19 And now, send word, bring your livestock and all that you have in the field into shelter. The hail will fall on every man and beast that is found in the field and is not brought indoors; it will fall on them, and they will die.”’”
20 Those among Pharaoh’s servants who feared the word of the Lord made their servants and livestock gather under shelter.
21 But those who did not pay attention to the word of the Lord left their servants and livestock in the field.

22 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, so that hail may fall on all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and on every plant of the field throughout the land of Egypt.”
23 And Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt.
24 So there was hail, and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very severe, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
25 And the hail struck all that was in the field through all the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and the hail struck every plant of the field and shattered every tree of the field.
26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, there was no hail.

27 Then Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron and said to them, “I have sinned this time; the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are guilty.
28 Plead with the Lord, for there has been enough of God’s thunder and hail. I will send you out, and you shall stay no longer.”
29 And Moses said to him, “As soon as I go out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the Lord; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth belongs to the Lord.
30 But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the Lord God.”
31 (Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bloom.
32 But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they ripen late.)

33 So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to the Lord, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and rain no longer poured on the earth.
34 But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, both he and his servants.
35 So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, just as the Lord had spoken through Moses.


Chapter 10

1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, so that I may display these signs of Mine among them,
2 and so that you may recount in the hearing of your sons and your grandsons how I dealt harshly with Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them, that you may know that I am the LORD.”

3 So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews: How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
4 For if you refuse to let My people go, then tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.
5 They will cover the face of the land so that no one will be able to see the ground. They will consume the remainder of what has escaped—what is left to you after the hail—and they will eat every tree of yours that grows in the field.
6 They will fill your houses and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians—something your fathers and your forefathers have never seen since the day they came upon the earth until this day.” Then he turned and left Pharaoh's presence.

7 Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, so that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is being ruined?”

8 So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve the LORD your God. But who exactly will be going?”

9 Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old; we will go with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds, for we must hold a feast to the LORD.”

10 But he said to them, “Let the LORD be with you, if I ever let you and your little ones go! See now, evil is before your faces.
11 No! Go now, but only your men, and serve the LORD, for that is what you were seeking.” And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.

12 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come upon the land of Egypt and consume every plant of the land, all that the hail has left behind.”
13 So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind had brought the locusts.

14 The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled in all the territory of Egypt in great swarms. Never before had there been such locusts as these, nor will there ever be again.
15 For they covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened. They consumed all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in the field throughout all the land of Egypt.

16 Then Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
17 Now please forgive my sin just this once, and plead with the LORD your God, that He would take this death away from me.”

18 So he went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
19 And the LORD turned the wind into a very strong west wind, and it lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust remained in all the territory of Egypt.
20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.

21 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness that can be felt.”
22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.
23 They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

24 Then Pharaoh called to Moses and said, “Go, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be kept back. Your little ones may go with you.”

25 But Moses said, “You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, so that we may sacrifice them to the LORD our God.
26 Our livestock also must go with us—not a hoof shall be left behind—for we must take some of them to serve the LORD our God, and we will not know with what we are to serve the LORD until we arrive there.”

27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was unwilling to let them go.
28 Then Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Take care never to see my face again, for on the day you see my face you shall die.”

29 Moses said, “You have spoken rightly; I will never see your face again.”


Chapter 11

1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “One more plague I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. After that, he will send you out from here. When he sends you out, he will surely drive you out altogether.
2 Speak now in the hearing of the people that every man is to ask from his neighbor and every woman from her neighbor for silver items and gold items.”
3 And the LORD gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt—in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people.

4 Moses said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt,
5 and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the servant woman who is behind the millstones, and all the firstborn of the cattle.
6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as has never been and such as shall never be again.
7 But not a dog shall growl against any of the sons of Israel, whether against man or beast, so that you may know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.’
8 Then all these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me, saying, ‘Go out, you and all the people who follow you!’ And after that I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.

9 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”
10 Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land.


Chapter 12

1 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
2 “This month shall be the beginning of months for you; it shall be the first month of the year for you.
3 Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying: On the tenth of this month, each man shall take a lamb for himself, according to his father's household—a lamb for each household.
4 And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor shall take one according to the number of persons; you shall determine the amount needed for the lamb according to what each man eats.
5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats.
6 You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight.

7 Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.
8 And they shall eat the flesh that night, roasted over fire; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
9 Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but only roasted over fire—its head with its legs and its inner parts.
10 You shall not leave any of it until morning, but anything that remains until morning you shall burn in the fire.

11 This is how you shall eat it: with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste—it is the LORD’s Passover.
12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and I will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt—I am the LORD.
13 And the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will come upon you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.

14 This day shall be a memorial for you, and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations, you shall celebrate it as a permanent statute.
15 For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses; for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.
16 On the first day you shall hold a holy assembly, and on the seventh day a holy assembly as well; no work at all shall be done on them, except what each person must eat—that alone may be prepared for you.
17 And you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent statute.

18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, you shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening.
19 For seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses; for whoever eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel—whether a foreigner or a native of the land.
20 You shall not eat anything leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.”

21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go and take for yourselves lambs according to your families, and slaughter the Passover lamb.
22 Then you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts. And none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning.
23 For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you.

24 And you shall observe this event as a statute for you and for your sons forever.
25 And it will happen that when you enter the land which the LORD will give you, just as He promised, you shall keep this service.
26 And when your sons say to you, ‘What does this service mean to you?’
27 you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the LORD’s Passover, for He passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians, but spared our houses.’” And the people bowed low and worshiped.
28 Then the sons of Israel went and did so—just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, that's what they did.

29 Then at midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock.
30 Pharaoh arose in the night—he and all his servants and all the Egyptians—and there was great lamenting in Egypt, for there was no house where someone was not dead.
31 Then he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, “Rise up, go out from among my people, both you and the sons of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.
32 Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go—and bless me also.”

33 And the Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We will all be dead.”
34 So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in their cloaks on their shoulders.
35 And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses—they had asked from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold and garments;
36 and the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so they granted them what they requested. So they plundered the Egyptians.

37 Now the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.
38 And a mixed multitude also went up with them, along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock.
39 And they baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread, for it had not been leavened—because they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared provisions for themselves.

40 Now the time that the sons of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
41 And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the hosts of the LORD exited from the land of Egypt.
42 It was a night of watching for the LORD to bring them out of the land of Egypt; so this same night is a night of watching to the LORD for all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.

43 And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: no foreigner shall eat it.
44 But every man’s slave who is bought for money, after you have circumcised him, may eat of it.
45 A foreigner or a hired servant shall not eat of it.
46 It shall be eaten in a single house; you shall not bring any of the meat outside of the house, nor shall you break any of its bones.
47 All the congregation of Israel shall celebrate it.
48 But if a sojourner resides with you and wants to observe the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near to observe it, and he shall be as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat of it.
49 The same law shall apply to the native as to the sojourner who resides among you.”

50 Then all the sons of Israel did so; just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, that's what they did.
51 And it happened on that very day that the LORD brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.


Chapter 13

1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
2 “Set apart to Me every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the sons of Israel, both of man and beast; it belongs to Me.”

3 And Moses said to the people, “Remember this day in which you came out from Egypt, from the house of slavery, for by a powerful hand the LORD brought you out from this place. Nothing leavened shall be eaten.  
4 On this day in the month of Abib you are going out.  
5 And it shall be, when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you—a land flowing with milk and honey—that you shall perform this service in this month.  
6 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.  
7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days, and nothing leavened shall be seen with you, nor shall any leaven be seen within all your borders.  
8 And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, ‘I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’  
9 And it shall be as a sign on your hand and as a reminder on your forehead, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth; for with a mighty hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt.  
10 Therefore you shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year.

11 And it shall be, when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and to your fathers and gives it to you,  
12 that you shall set apart to the LORD every first offspring of the womb, and every firstborn of your livestock that are males shall belong to the LORD.  
13 But every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. And every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem.

14 And it shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ then you shall say to him, ‘With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of slavery.  
15 For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD every male that first opens the womb, but every firstborn of my sons I redeem.’  
16 And it shall be as a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for with a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.”

17 Now it happened, when Pharaoh let the people go, that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, though it was near; for God said, “Lest the people change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt.”  
18 But God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea. And the sons of Israel went up in battle array from the land of Egypt.

19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones with you from here.”  
20 Then they set out from Succoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.  
21 And the LORD was going before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.  
22 He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.


Chapter 14

1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; before Baal-zephon you shall encamp opposite it, by the sea.  
3 For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, ‘They are wandering in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’  
4 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, so that he will pursue them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and over all his army. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD.” And they did so.

5 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?”  
6 So he made his chariot ready and took his people with him.  
7 He took six hundred choice chariots and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.  
8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the sons of Israel as the sons of Israel were going out with a high hand.  
9 Then the Egyptians pursued them—all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army—and overtook them encamped by the sea, by Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.

10 When Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and saw the Egyptians were marching after them, and they were very afraid. And the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD.  
11 They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What is this you have done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?  
12 Isn’t this what we spoke about to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”  
13 And Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD, which He will work for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again.  
14 The LORD will fight for you, and you shall keep silent.”

15 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why do you cry to me? Tell the sons of Israel to go forward.  
16 And you—lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it, so the sons of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground.  
17 As for me, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they follow after them, and I will magnify myself above Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen.  
18 Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I magnify myself Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”

19 And the angel of God, who was going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them. And the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.  
20 So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And there was the cloud and darkness, yet it gave light by night. And the one did not come near the other all night.

21 Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea into dry land, and the waters were divided.  
22 And the sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right and on their left.  
23 Then the Egyptians pursued and went in after them—all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen—into the midst of the sea.

24 And in the morning watch, the LORD looked down on the camp of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and He threw the Egyptian camp into confusion.  
25 He removed the wheels from their chariots so that they drove them with difficulty. And the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from before Israel, for the LORD is fighting for them against the Egyptians.”

26 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the waters may return upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and upon their horsemen.”  
27 So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal flow when the morning appeared. And the Egyptians fled into it, and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.  
28 The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen—all the army of Pharaoh that had gone in after them into the sea—not one of them survived.  
29 But the sons of Israel walked on dry ground through the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right and on their left.

30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.  
31 And Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, and the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in His servant Moses.


Chapter 15

1 Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the Lord, saying:  
“I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted;  
The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea.  
2 The Lord is my strength and song,  
And He has become my salvation;  
This is my God, and I will praise Him,  
My father’s God, and I will exalt Him.  
3 The Lord is a warrior;  
The Lord is His name.  
4 Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He cast into the sea,  
And his elite officers were drowned in the Red Sea.  
5 The depths covered them;  
They went down into the depths like a stone.

6 Your right hand, O Lord, is majestic in power,  
Your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy.  
7 In the greatness of Your majesty You overthrow those who rise up against You;  
You send forth Your burning anger—it consumes them like stubble.  
8 At the blast of Your nostrils the waters were piled up,  
The flowing waters stood up like a heap;  
The deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.  
9 The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake,  
I will divide the spoil;  
My desire shall be gratified against them;  
I will draw my sword, my hand will destroy them.’  
10 But You blew with Your wind, and the sea covered them;  
They sank like lead into the mighty waters.

11 Who is like You among the gods, O Lord?  
Who is like You, majestic in holiness,  
Awesome in praises, working wonders?  
12 You stretched out Your right hand,  
The earth swallowed them.  
13 In Your lovingkindness You have led the people whom You have redeemed;  
In Your strength You have guided them to Your holy dwelling.

14 The peoples have heard, they tremble;  
Anguish has seized the inhabitants of Philistia.
15 Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed;  
The leaders of Moab, trembling grips them;  
All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.  
16 Terror and dread fall upon them;  
By the greatness of Your arm they are motionless as stone,  
Until Your people pass through, O Lord,  
Until the people pass through whom You have purchased.  
17 You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance,  
The place, O Lord, which You have made for Your dwelling,  
The sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established.  
18 The Lord shall reign forever and ever.”

19 For the horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them, but the sons of Israel walked on dry ground through the midst of the sea.

20 Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the tambourine in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dancing.  
21 Miriam answered them,  
“Sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted;  
The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea.”

22 Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the Wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.  
23 When they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore it was named Marah.  
24 So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?”  
25 Then he cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree; and he threw it into the waters, and the waters became sweet.

There He made for them a statute and a regulation, and there He tested them.  
26 And He said, “If you will diligently listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and do what is right in His eyes, and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the Lord who heals you.”

27 Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy date palms, and they encamped there beside the waters.


Chapter 16

1 Then they set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had gone out of the land of Egypt.  
2 And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.  
3 The sons of Israel said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by pots of meat, when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”  

4 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, so that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not.  
5 And on the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”  

6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, “At evening you will know that the LORD has brought you out of the land of Egypt,  
7 and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, for He hears your grumblings against the LORD. And what are we, that you grumble against us?”  
8 Moses also said, “When the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening and bread to the full in the morning, because the LORD hears your grumblings which you grumble against Him—what are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD.”  

9 Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, ‘Come near before the LORD, for He has heard your grumblings.’”  
10 And it came about as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.  

11 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
12 “I have heard the grumblings of the sons of Israel. Speak to them, saying, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.’”  

13 So it came about in the evening that quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.  
14 And when the layer of dew had lifted, behold, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground.  
15 When the sons of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.  

16 This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Gather from it, each man as much as he may eat; you shall take an omer apiece according to the number of persons each of you has in his tent.’”  
17 And the sons of Israel did so, and gathered, some more and some less.  
18 When they measured it with an omer, the one who gathered much had nothing left over, and the one who gathered little had no lack; each man gathered as much as he could eat.  
19 And Moses said to them, “Let no one leave any of it until morning.”  
20 But they did not listen to Moses, and some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. So Moses was angry with them.  
21 They gathered it morning by morning, each man as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.  

22 Now on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses.  
23 Then he said to them, “This is what the LORD has spoken: ‘Tomorrow is a day of rest, a holy sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning.’”  
24 So they put it aside until morning, as Moses had ordered, and it did not stink, nor was there any worm in it.  
25 And Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field.  
26 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the sabbath, there will be none.”  

27 And it came about on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.  
28 Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?  
29 See, the LORD has given you the sabbath; therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Each of you remain in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.”  
30 So the people rested on the seventh day.  

31 And the house of Israel called its name Manna. And it was like coriander seed, white, and its taste was like wafers with honey.  
32 Then Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread which I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”  
33 And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.”  
34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept.  

35 And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.  
36 (Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.)


Chapter 17

Chapter 18

1 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt.

2 Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away,
3 and her two sons—of whom one was named Gershom, for Moses said, “I have been a sojourner in a foreign land,”
4 and the other was named Eliezer, for he said, “The God of my father was my help, and He delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.”

5 Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was camped, at the mountain of God.
6 And he sent word to Moses: “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her.”

7 So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him. They asked each other about their welfare and went into the tent.
8 Then Moses recounted to his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardship that had befallen them on the journey, and how the Lord had delivered them.

9 Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness which the Lord had done for Israel, in delivering them from the hand of the Egyptians.
10 And Jethro said, “Blessed be the Lord, who delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh, and who delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
11 Now I know that the Lord is greater than all the gods; indeed, in the matter in which they dealt arrogantly against them, He was above them.”

12 Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.

13 It came about the next day that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood before Moses from the morning until the evening.
14 When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone as judge, while all the people stand before you from morning until evening?”

15 Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
16 When they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor and make known the statutes of God and His laws.”

17 Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you are doing is not good.
18 You will surely wear yourself out, both you and these people who are with you, for the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone.
19 Now listen to me; I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You be the representative for the people before God, and you bring the matters to God.
20 Then you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they are to walk and the work they are to do.

21 Furthermore, you shall choose out of all the people able men who fear God, men of truth, those who hate dishonest gain, and you shall place them as leaders over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.
22 Let them judge the people at all times. Let every major dispute be brought to you, but every minor case they themselves will judge. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.
23 If you do this thing and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace.”

24 So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
25 Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people: leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
26 They judged the people at all times; the difficult cases they brought to Moses, but every minor case they judged themselves.

27 Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way to his own land.


Chapter 19

1 On the third new moon after the sons of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.  
2 They set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they camped in the wilderness. Israel camped there in front of the mountain.  
3 Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, “This is what you shall say to the house of Jacob, and declare to the sons of Israel:  
4 ‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself.  
5 Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then out of all the nations you shall be My treasured possession, for all the earth is Mine.  
6 And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel.”  

7 So Moses came and summoned the elders of the people, and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him.  
8 Then all the people answered together and said, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do.” And Moses brought back the words of the people to the LORD.  
9 The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also trust in you forever.” Then Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD.  

10 The LORD also said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments.  
11 And let them be ready for the third day, for on the third day the LORD will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.  
12 You shall set boundaries for the people all around, saying, ‘Take care not to go up the mountain or touch the edge of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.  
13 No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether beast or man, he shall not live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.”  

14 So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated them, and they washed their garments.  
15 And he said to the people, “Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman.”  

16 On the third day, when morning came, there was thunder and lightning and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud sound of a ram’s horn, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled.  
17 Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.  
18 Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the LORD had descended on it in fire. The smoke went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled violently.  
19 As the sound of the ram’s horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder.  

20 Then the LORD came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.  
21 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people, so they do not break through to the LORD to look, and many of them perish.  
22 Also let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, lest the LORD break out against them.”  
23 Moses said to the LORD, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for You Yourself warned us, saying, ‘Set boundaries around the mountain and consecrate it.’”  
24 But the LORD said to him, “Go down, and then come up again, you and Aaron with you. But do not let the priests or the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest He break out against them.”  
25 So Moses went down to the people and told them.


Chapter 20

L1 Then God spoke all these words, saying,

2 “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

3 You shall have no other gods before Me.

4 You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth.
5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me,
6 but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love Me and keep My commandments.

7 You shall not take up the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not leave him unpunished who takes up His name in vain.

8 Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
10 but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, your son or your daughter, your servant or your maid, your cattle, or the sojourner who is within your gates.
11 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but He rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

12 Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be prolonged in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.

13 You shall not murder.

14 You shall not commit adultery.

15 You shall not steal.

16 You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

17 You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his servant or his maid, or his ox or his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”

18 And all the people perceived the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled and stood at a distance.
19 Then they said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen, but let not God speak to us, lest we die.”

20 And Moses said to the people, “Do not fear, for God has come to test you, so that the fear of Him may be before you, that you may not sin.”

21 So the people stood at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.

22 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel: ‘You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven.
23 You shall not make other gods alongside Me; gods of silver or gods of gold you shall not make for yourselves.

24 You shall make for Me an altar of earth, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.

25 If you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it with hewn stones, for if you wield your tool upon it, you will profane it.
26 And you shall not ascend by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness may not be exposed upon it.’”


Chapter 21

1 These are the ordinances which you shall set before them:

2 If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years, but in the seventh he shall go free without payment.
3 If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he is married, then his wife shall go out with him.
4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out by himself.
5 But if the servant plainly says, "I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,"
6 then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost; and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him permanently.

7 If a man sells his daughter as a maidservant, she shall not go out as the male servants do.
8 If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed; he has no right to sell her to a foreign people since he has dealt deceitfully with her.
9 If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters.
10 If he takes to himself another woman, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.
11 And if he does not do these three things for her, then she shall go out free without payment of silver.

12 He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.
13 But if he did not lie in wait, but God let it happen into his hand, then I will appoint you a place to which he may flee.
14 However, if a man acts presumptuously against his neighbor to kill him by deceit, you shall take him even from My altar, that he may die.

15 He who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.

16 He who kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or he is found in his possession, shall surely be put to death.

17 He who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.

18 If men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and he does not die but is confined to his bed,
19 if he rises and walks about outside on his staff, then he who struck him shall go unpunished; only he shall pay for his loss of time and shall see to his complete healing.

20 If a man strikes his servant or his maidservant with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall surely be punished.
21 However, if he survives a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his property.

22 If men struggle with each other and strike a pregnant woman so that she gives birth prematurely but there is no injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband demands of him, and he shall pay as the judges determine.
23 But if there is injury, then you shall appoint life for life,
24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.

26 If a man strikes the eye of his servant or the eye of his maidservant and destroys it, he shall let him go free on account of his eye.
27 And if he knocks out a tooth of his servant or of his maidservant, he shall let him go free on account of his tooth.

28 If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall surely be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall go unpunished.
29 But if the ox was known to be accustomed to gore in the past and its owner had been warned but did not guard it, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death.
30 If a ransom is imposed upon him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is imposed on him.
31 Whether it gores a son or a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done to him.
32 If the ox gores a male servant or a female servant, he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

33 If a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
34 the owner of the pit shall make restitution; he shall give money to its owner, and the dead animal shall become his.

35 If one man's ox injures another's so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide its price equally, and they shall also divide the dead animal.
36 Or if it is known that the ox was accustomed to gore in the past and its owner has not kept it under guard, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead animal shall become his.


Chapter 22

1 If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it, he shall repay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.

2 If a thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no bloodguilt for him.
3 But if the sun has risen on him, there shall be bloodguilt for him. He shall make full restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
4 If the stolen beast is found alive in his possession, whether it is an ox or a donkey or a sheep, he shall pay double.

5 If a man causes a field or vineyard to be grazed over, or lets his beast loose so that it grazes in another man's field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field or vineyard.

6 If a fire breaks out and catches in thorns so that the stacked grain or the standing grain or the field is consumed, he who started the fire shall make full restitution.

7 If a man gives his neighbor money or goods to keep safe, and they are stolen from the man's house, then if the thief is found, he shall pay double.
8 If the thief is not found, the owner of the house shall come near to God, to determine whether he has put his hand to his neighbor's property.

9 For every breach of trust, whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment, or for any lost thing about which one says, "This is it," the case of both parties shall come before God. The one whom God condemns shall pay double to his neighbor.

10 If a man gives to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any beast to keep safe, and it dies or is injured or is driven away without anyone seeing it,
11 an oath by the LORD shall be between them both to see whether he has put his hand to his neighbor's property. The owner shall accept the oath, and he shall not make restitution.
12 But if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution to the owner.
13 If it is torn by beasts, let him bring it as evidence. He shall not make restitution for what has been torn.

14 If a man borrows anything of his neighbor, and it is injured or dies, the owner not being with it, he shall make full restitution.
15 If the owner was with it, he shall not make restitution. If it was hired, it came for its hiring fee.

16 If a man entices a virgin who is not betrothed and lies with her, he shall pay the bride-price for her to be his wife.
17 If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money equivalent to the bride-price for virgins.

18 You shall not permit a sorceress to live.

19 Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death.

20 Whoever sacrifices to any god, other than the LORD alone, shall be devoted to destruction.

21 You shall not wrong a sojourner or oppress him, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.

22 You shall not mistreat any widow or fatherless child.
23 If you do mistreat them, and they cry out to me, I will surely hear their cry,
24 and my wrath will burn, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless.

25 If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be like a moneylender to him, and you shall not exact interest from him.
26 If ever you take your neighbor's cloak in pledge, you shall return it to him before the sun goes down,
27 for that is his only covering, and it is his cloak for his body. In what else shall he sleep? And if he cries to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.

28 You shall not revile God, nor curse a ruler of your people.

29 You shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses. The firstborn of your sons you shall give to me.
30 You shall do the same with your oxen and with your sheep. Seven days it shall be with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to me.

31 You shall be consecrated to me. Therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by beasts in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs.


Chapter 23

1 Do not spread a false report. Do not join hands with a wicked man to be a malicious witness.
2 You shall not follow a crowd to do evil. Nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to pervert justice by siding with the majority.
3 Nor shall you show partiality to a poor man in his lawsuit.

4 If you come across your enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, you shall surely return it to him.
5 If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying under its burden, you shall refrain from leaving it to suffer; you shall surely help him with it.

6 You shall not pervert the justice due to your poor in his lawsuit.

7 Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent or the righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked.

8 You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the words of the righteous.

9 You shall not oppress a sojourner. You know the mind of a sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.

10 For six years you shall sow your land and gather in its produce,
11 but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, so that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave, the beast of the field shall eat. You shall do likewise with your vineyard and with your olive grove.

12 Six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall rest, so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female servant, and the sojourner, may be refreshed.

13 Be careful to do all that I have said to you. Do not invoke the name of other gods, nor let it be heard on your lips.

14 Three times in the year you shall hold a feast for Me.
15 You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Aviv—for in it you came out of Egypt. No one shall appear before Me empty-handed.
16 Also the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of your labors, of what you sow in the field; and the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in the produce of your labor from the field.
17 Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord GOD.

18 You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall the fat of My feast remain until morning.

19 The best of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God.

You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.

20 Behold, I am sending an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared.
21 Pay careful attention to him and listen to his voice. Do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgression, for My name is in him.
22 But if you carefully listen to his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.
23 For My angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, and I will wipe them out.
24 You shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them, nor do as they do. Rather, you shall completely overthrow them and break their sacred pillars in pieces.

25 You shall serve the LORD your God, and He will bless your bread and your water. And I will remove sickness from among you.
26 None shall miscarry or be barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days.
27 I will send My terror before you and will throw into confusion all the people against whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.
28 And I will send the hornet before you, and it shall drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites from before you.
29 I will not drive them out before you in one year, lest the land become desolate and the wild beasts multiply against you.
30 Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased and possessed the land.

31 And I will set your border from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River, for I will give the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out from before you.
32 You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods.
33 They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against Me. For if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.


Chapter 24

1 And He said to Moses, “Go up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and you shall worship from a distance.
2 And Moses alone shall come near to the LORD, but they shall not come near, and the people shall not go up with him.”

3 So Moses came and recounted to the people all the words of the LORD and all the ordinances, and all the people answered with one voice and said, “All the words which the LORD has spoken we will do.”

4 Then Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. And he rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.
5 And he sent young men of the sons of Israel, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed bulls as peace offerings to the LORD.
6 Then Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

7 And he took the book of the covenant and read it aloud in the hearing of the people, and they said, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will obey.”
8 So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and said, “Behold the blood of the covenant which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.”

9 Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,
10 and they saw the God of Israel. And under His feet there was something like a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself.
11 Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel; and they beheld God, and they ate and drank.

12 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Come up to Me on the mountain and remain there, and I will give you the tablets of stone and the law and the commandment which I have written for their instruction.”
13 So Moses arose with Joshua his servant, and Moses went up onto the mountain of God.

14 And he said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a matter, let him go to them.”
15 Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.

16 And the glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. And on the seventh day He called to Moses from the midst of the cloud.
17 And the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the sons of Israel.
18 So Moses entered the cloud and went up on the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.


Chapter 25

1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, that they may take for Me a contribution. From every man whose heart moves him you shall take My contribution.

3 And this is the contribution that you shall take from them: gold and silver and bronze,  
4 blue and purple and scarlet yarn, fine linen and goats’ hair,  
5 tanned rams’ skins, dolphin skins, and acacia wood,  
6 oil for the lamp, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,  
7 onyx stones and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastpiece.

8 And let them make for Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst.  
9 According to all that I am going to show you—the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furnishings—just so you shall make it.

10 They shall make an ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide and one and a half cubits high.  
11 You shall overlay it with pure gold—inside and out you shall overlay it—and you shall make a gold molding around it.  
12 You shall cast four rings of gold for it and put them on its four feet, two rings on the one side of it and two rings on the other side.  
13 You shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.  
14 You shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark by them.  
15 The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be removed from it.  
16 You shall put into the ark the testimony that I shall give you.

17 You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.  
18 You shall make two cherubim of gold; of hammered work you shall make them at the two ends of the mercy seat.  
19 Make one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end. From the mercy seat you shall make the cherubim on its two ends.  
20 The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall face one another; the faces of the cherubim shall be toward the mercy seat.  
21 You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you.  
22 There I will meet with you, and I will speak with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim that are on the ark of the testimony, about all that I shall command you concerning the sons of Israel.

23 You shall make a table of acacia wood, two cubits long and one cubit wide and one and a half cubits high.  
24 You shall overlay it with pure gold and make a gold molding around it.  
25 You shall make a rim around it, a handbreadth wide, and a gold molding around the rim.  
26 You shall make four rings of gold for it and fasten the rings to the four corners at its four legs.  
27 The rings shall be close to the rim as holders for the poles to carry the table.  
28 You shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, and the table shall be carried with them.  
29 You shall make its plates and its dishes, its jars and its bowls with which to pour drink offerings; you shall make them of pure gold.  
30 You shall set the bread of the Presence on the table before Me regularly.

31 You shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand shall be made of hammered work—its base and its stem, its cups, its calyxes, and its blossoms shall be of one piece with it.  
32 Six branches shall go out from its sides: three branches of the lampstand out from one side and three branches of the lampstand out from the other side.  
33 Three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with calyx and blossom, shall be on one branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms on the other branch—the same for the six branches going out from the lampstand.  
34 And on the lampstand itself there shall be four cups shaped like almond blossoms, with calyxes and blossoms,  
35 and a calyx under the first pair of branches from it, and a calyx under the second pair of branches from it, and a calyx under the third pair of branches from it—for the six branches going out from the lampstand.  
36 Their calyxes and their branches shall be of one piece with it, all of it a single hammered work of pure gold.  
37 You shall make its seven lamps, and the lamps shall be set up so as to give light in front of it.  
38 Its tongs and its trays shall be of pure gold.  
39 It shall be made from a talent of pure gold, with all these utensils.  
40 See that you make them according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain.


Chapter 26

1 Moreover, you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine linen twisted, and blue and purple and scarlet yarns; you shall make them with cherubim skillfully worked into them.
2 The length of each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains shall have the same measurement.
3 Five curtains shall be joined to one another, and the other five curtains shall be joined to one another.
4 And you shall make loops of blue on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and likewise you shall make them on the edge of the end curtain in the second set.
5 You shall make fifty loops on the one curtain, and fifty loops you shall make on the edge of the curtain that is in the second set; the loops shall be opposite one another.
6 And you shall make fifty clasps of gold, and join the curtains to one another with the clasps, so that the tabernacle may become one whole.
7 And you shall make curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains shall you make.
8 The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains shall have the same measurement.
9 And you shall join five curtains by themselves, and the six curtains by themselves, and double over the sixth curtain at the front of the tent.
10 And you shall make fifty loops on the edge of the one end curtain in the first set, and fifty loops on the edge of the end curtain that joins the second.
11 And you shall make fifty clasps of bronze, and put the clasps into the loops, and join the tent together so that it becomes one.
12 And the excess that remains of the curtains of the tent—the half curtain that is left over—shall hang over the back of the tabernacle.
13 And the cubit on the one side and the cubit on the other side of what remains in the length of the curtains of the tent shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle, on both sides, to cover it.

14 And you shall make a covering for the tent of tanned rams’ skins and a covering of fine leather above.

15 And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright.
16 Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall be the width of each board.
17 Each board shall have two tenons, joined to one another; thus shall you do for all the boards of the tabernacle.
18 And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side facing southward.
19 And you shall make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards—two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
20 And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, twenty boards
21 and their forty sockets of silver—two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
22 And for the rear of the tabernacle westward you shall make six boards.
23 And you shall make two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear.
24 And they shall be doubled at the bottom, and together they shall be complete at the top to the first ring; thus shall it be with both of them—they shall form the two corners.
25 And there shall be eight boards, with their sockets of silver—sixteen sockets—two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
26 And you shall make bars of acacia wood: five for the boards on the one side of the tabernacle,
27 and five bars for the boards on the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards on the rear side of the tabernacle westward.
28 And the middle bar in the center of the boards shall pass through from end to end.
29 And you shall overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and you shall overlay the bars with gold.

30 And you shall erect the tabernacle according to the plan that you were shown on the mountain.

31 And you shall make a veil of blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twisted linen; it shall be made with cherubim skillfully worked.
32 And you shall hang it on four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold, with hooks of gold, on four sockets of silver.
33 And you shall hang the veil under the clasps, and bring in there, behind the veil, the ark of the testimony; and the veil shall separate for you between the Holy Place and the Most Holy.
34 And you shall put the mercy seat on the ark of the testimony in the Most Holy Place.
35 And you shall set the table outside the veil, and the lampstand opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle; and you shall place the table on the north side.
36 And you shall make a screen for the entrance of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer.
37 And you shall make for the screen five pillars of acacia, and overlay them with gold, their hooks shall be of gold, and you shall cast five sockets of bronze for them.


Chapter 27

1 You shall make the altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide—the altar shall be square—and its height shall be three cubits.
2 And you shall make horns on its four corners; its horns shall be of one piece with it, and you shall overlay it with bronze.
3 And you shall make its pots to remove its ashes, and its shovels, and its basins, and its forks, and its firepans—you shall make all its utensils of bronze.
4 And you shall make for it a networked grating, a bronze mesh, and on the mesh you shall make four bronze rings at its four corners.
5 And you shall set it beneath the ledge of the altar, from below, so that the mesh reaches halfway up the altar.
6 And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze.
7 And its poles shall be put into the rings, and the poles shall be on the two sides of the altar when it is carried.
8 You shall make it hollow with boards; they shall make it as it was shown to you on the mountain.

9 And you shall make the court of the tabernacle. On the south side, the court shall have hangings of fine linen, one hundred cubits in length for the one side,
10 and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets shall be of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands shall be of silver.
11 And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings one hundred cubits long, and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets shall be of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands shall be of silver.
12 And for the width of the court on the west side there shall be hangings fifty cubits, with their ten pillars and their ten sockets.
13 And the width of the court on the front, to the east, shall be fifty cubits.
14 The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets.
15 And on the second side there shall be hangings of fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets.
16 And for the gate of the court there shall be a screen of twenty cubits, of blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twisted linen, embroidered with needlework, with four pillars and their four sockets.
17 All the pillars of the court around shall be bound with silver, their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets shall be of bronze.
18 The length of the court shall be one hundred cubits, and the width fifty throughout, and the height five cubits, of fine twisted linen, and their sockets of bronze.
19 All the utensils of the tabernacle in all its service, and all its pegs, and all the pegs of the court, shall be of bronze.

20 And you shall command the sons of Israel that they bring to you pure beaten olive oil for the light, to make the lamp burn continually.
21 In the tent of meeting, outside the veil that is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall set it in order, from evening to morning, before the LORD. It shall be a statute forever for their generations, from the sons of Israel.


Chapter 28

1 And you shall bring near to you Aaron your brother, and his sons with him, from among the sons of Israel, to serve Me as priest—Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron.
2 And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for glory and for beauty.

3 And you shall speak to all the skilled men, whom I have filled with a spirit of wisdom, and they shall make the garments of Aaron, to consecrate him, that he may serve Me as priest.
4 These are the garments that they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a tunic of checker work, a turban, and a sash. And they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother and for his sons, to serve Me as priests.
5 They shall take the gold, and the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet yarn, and the fine linen.
6 And they shall make the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet yarn, and fine twined linen, skillfully worked.
7 It shall have two shoulder pieces joined to its two edges, and it shall be joined together.
8 And the skillfully woven waistband of the ephod that is on it shall be of the same workmanship, of one piece with it: of gold, blue, purple, scarlet yarn, and fine twined linen.
9 And you shall take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel,
10 six of their names on the one stone, and the remaining six names on the other stone, in the order of their birth.
11 As a gem-cutter engraves signets, so you shall engrave the two stones with the names of the sons of Israel; you shall enclose them in settings of gold filigree.
12 And you shall set the two stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel. And Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD on his two shoulders for remembrance.
13 And you shall make settings of gold filigree,
14 and two chains of pure gold, twisted like cords, and you shall attach the corded chains to the settings.

15 And you shall make a breastpiece of judgment, skillfully worked; like the work of the ephod you shall make it: of gold, blue, purple, scarlet yarn, and fine twined linen you shall make it.
16 It shall be square and doubled, a span in length and a span in width.
17 And you shall set in it settings of stones, four rows of stones: a row of sardius, topaz, and emerald shall be the first row;
18 and the second row a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;
19 and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
20 and the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper; they shall be enclosed in gold filigree in their settings.
21 And the stones shall be with the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, according to their names. They shall be like signets, each engraved with its name, for the twelve tribes.
22 And you shall make for the breastpiece twisted chains like cords, of pure gold.
23 And you shall make for the breastpiece two rings of gold, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece.
24 And you shall put the two cords of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece.
25 And the other two ends of the two cords you shall fasten to the two settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it.
26 And you shall make two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inner edge, which is toward the ephod.
27 And you shall make two rings of gold, and attach them to the front of the ephod, low on the two shoulder pieces, close to the place where it is joined, above the skillfully woven waistband of the ephod.
28 And they shall bind the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a cord of blue, so that it may lie on the skillfully woven waistband of the ephod, and the breastpiece shall not come loose from the ephod.
29 And Aaron shall bear the names of the sons of Israel in the breastpiece of judgment on his heart, when he goes into the holy place, for a remembrance before the LORD continually.
30 And you shall put into the breastpiece of judgment the Urim and the Thummim, and they shall be on Aaron’s heart, when he goes in before the LORD. And Aaron shall bear the judgment of the sons of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.

31 And you shall make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue.
32 It shall have an opening for the head in the middle of it; around its opening there shall be a binding, a woven work like the opening of a garment, so that it does not tear.
33 And on its hem you shall make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, all around its hem, with bells of gold between them all around:
34 a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, on the hem of the robe all around.
35 And it shall be on Aaron when he ministers, and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the holy place before the LORD and when he comes out, so that he does not die.

36 And you shall make a plate of pure gold, and engrave on it, like the engraving of a signet, “Holy to the LORD.”
37 And you shall fasten it on a blue cord, and it shall be on the turban; it shall be at the front of the turban.
38 And it shall be on Aaron’s forehead, and Aaron shall bear the guilt of the holy things, which the sons of Israel consecrate, all their holy gifts; and it shall be always on his forehead, to accept them before the LORD.

39 And you shall weave the tunic of fine linen, and you shall make a turban of fine linen, and you shall make a sash, the work of an embroiderer.

40 And for Aaron’s sons you shall make tunics, and you shall make sashes for them, and turbans for them, for glory and for beauty.

41 And you shall clothe them—Aaron your brother and his sons with him—and anoint them and ordain them and consecrate them, so that they may serve Me as priests.

42 And you shall make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh; they shall reach from the loins to the thighs.
43 And they shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they go into the tent of meeting or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy place, so that they do not incur guilt and die. This shall be a statute forever for him and for his seed after him.


Chapter 29

1 And this is what you shall do to them to consecrate them, to minister as priests to Me: Take one young bull and two rams without blemish,
2 and unleavened bread and unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil—you shall make them of fine wheat flour.
3 And you shall put them in one basket, and bring them in the basket, and bring the bull and the two rams.
4 Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and wash them with water.
5 And you shall take the garments, and clothe Aaron with the tunic and the robe of the ephod and the ephod and the breastpiece, and gird him with the skillfully woven sash of the ephod.
6 And you shall set the turban on his head, and put the holy crown on the turban.
7 Then you shall take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him.
8 And you shall bring his sons and clothe them with tunics.
9 And you shall gird them with sashes, Aaron and his sons, and bind headdresses on them, and the priesthood shall be theirs by a perpetual statute. Thus you shall ordain Aaron and his sons.

10 Then you shall bring the bull before the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull.
11 And you shall slaughter the bull before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
12 And you shall take some of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and you shall pour out all the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
13 And you shall take all the fat that covers the entrails, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and offer them up in smoke on the altar.
14 But the flesh of the bull and its skin and its dung you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering.

15 Then you shall take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.
16 And you shall slaughter the ram and take its blood and sprinkle it all around on the altar.
17 Then you shall cut the ram into pieces, and wash its entrails and its legs, and put them with its pieces and with its head.
18 And you shall offer up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the LORD; it is a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.

19 Then you shall take the second ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.
20 And you shall slaughter the ram and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and on the lobe of his sons’ right ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet, and sprinkle the rest of the blood around on the altar.
21 Then you shall take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and on his garments and on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him. And he shall be holy, and his garments, and his sons and the garments of his sons with him.
22 You shall also take the fat from the ram, and the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails, and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of ordination),
23 and one loaf of bread and one cake of bread mixed with oil and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread that is before the LORD.
24 And you shall place all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.
25 Then you shall take them from their hands and offer them up in smoke on the altar on top of the burnt offering as a pleasing aroma before the LORD. It is an offering by fire to the LORD.

26 And you shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s ordination, and wave it as a wave offering before the LORD, and it shall be your portion.
27 And you shall consecrate the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution that is waved and that is contributed from the ram of ordination, from what was Aaron’s and from what was his sons’.
28 And it shall be for Aaron and for his sons as a perpetual statute from the sons of Israel, for it is a contribution; and it shall be a contribution from the sons of Israel from their peace offerings, their contribution to the LORD.
29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, that in them they may be anointed and ordained.

30 For seven days the one of his sons who is priest in his place shall put them on when he enters the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.
31 And you shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a holy place.
32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
33 And they shall eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration; but a stranger shall not eat them, because they are holy.
34 And if any of the flesh of ordination or any of the bread remains until morning, you shall burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
35 Thus you shall do to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you; you shall ordain them for seven days.
36 And each day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement, and you shall purify the altar when you make atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to consecrate it.
37 For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. Then the altar shall be most holy, and whatever touches the altar shall be holy.

38 Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two one-year-old lambs each day, regularly.
39 You shall offer one lamb in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight.
40 And with the first lamb, a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering.
41 And the other lamb you shall offer at twilight, and shall offer with it the same grain offering and the same drink offering as in the morning, as a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.
42 It shall be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before the LORD, where I will meet with you, to speak to you there.
43 And there I will meet with the sons of Israel, and it shall be sanctified by My glory.
44 And I will sanctify the tent of meeting and the altar. I will also sanctify Aaron and his sons to serve as priests to Me.
45 And I will dwell among the sons of Israel and will be their God.
46 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt that I might dwell among them. I am the LORD their God.


Chapter 30

1 You shall make an altar for burning incense; you shall make it of acacia wood.
2 A cubit in length and a cubit in width—it shall be square—and two cubits high; its horns shall be of one piece with it.
3 You shall overlay it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns; and you shall make a gold molding all around it.
4 And you shall make two gold rings for it under its molding, on its two opposite sides you shall make them, and they shall serve as holders for poles with which to carry it.
5 You shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
6 And you shall set it in front of the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, in front of the atonement cover that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.
7 And Aaron shall burn fragrant incense on it; morning by morning, when he trims the lamps, he shall burn it.

8 And when Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he shall burn it—a continual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.
9 You shall not offer strange incense on it, or a burnt offering or a grain offering; and you shall not pour out a drink offering on it.
10 And Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once a year; with the blood of the sin offering of atonement, once a year he shall make atonement for it throughout your generations. It is most holy to the LORD.

11 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
12 When you take a census of the sons of Israel to number them, each man shall give a ransom for his soul to the LORD when you number them, so that there will be no plague among them when you number them.
13 This they shall give, everyone who passes among those who are counted: half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel as a contribution to the LORD.
14 Everyone who passes among those who are counted, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the contribution to the LORD.
15 The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than the half shekel, when you give the contribution to the LORD to make atonement for your souls.
16 And you shall take the atonement money from the sons of Israel and shall give it for the service of the tent of meeting, so that it may be a memorial for the sons of Israel before the LORD, to make atonement for your souls.

17 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
18 You shall make a basin of bronze, with its stand of bronze, for washing; and you shall place it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.
19 And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet from it.
20 When they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, so that they do not die; or when they approach the altar to minister, to burn an offering by fire to the LORD,
21 they shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they do not die. And it shall be a perpetual statute for them, for him and for his seed throughout their generations.

22 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
23 Take for yourself the finest spices: flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and fragrant cinnamon half that amount, two hundred fifty, and fragrant cane two hundred fifty,
24 and cassia five hundred, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil.
25 And you shall make from it a sacred anointing oil, a perfumed blend, the work of a perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.
26 And you shall anoint with it the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony,
27 and the table and all its vessels, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,
28 and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin and its stand.
29 And you shall consecrate them, so that they shall be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy.
30 And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, so that they may serve Me as priests.

31 And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations.
32 It shall not be poured on the body of an ordinary man, and you shall not make anything like it with the same formulation; it is holy, and it shall be holy to you.
33 Whoever makes any like it or puts any of it on a stranger shall be cut off from his people.
34 And the LORD said to Moses, Take spices: stacte and onycha and galbanum—spices with pure frankincense—of equal amounts they shall be.
35 And you shall make them into incense, a compound blended by a perfumer, salted, pure, and holy.
36 And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put part of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you; it shall be most holy to you.
37 And the incense which you make, you shall not make for yourselves using its formulation; it shall be holy to you for the LORD.
38 Whoever makes any like it, to smell it, shall be cut off from his people.


Chapter 31

1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
3 And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, and with understanding, and with knowledge, and with all manner of craftsmanship,
4 to devise skillful works—to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze,
5 and in the cutting of stones for setting, and in carving wood—to work in all craftsmanship.

6 And behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. And in the heart of every wise-hearted man I have placed wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you:
7 the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the atonement cover that is on it, and all the furnishings of the tent,
8 and the table and its utensils, and the pure lampstand with all its utensils, and the altar of incense,
9 and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin and its stand,
10 and the woven garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons for ministering as priests,
11 and the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense for the sanctuary. They shall make them according to all that I have commanded you.

12 And the LORD said to Moses,
13 “You shall speak also to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘Surely you shall keep My sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.
14 Therefore you shall keep the sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
15 Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the sabbath day shall surely be put to death.
16 Therefore the sons of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations as a covenant forever.
17 It is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He ceased and was refreshed.’”
18 And He gave to Moses, when He had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.


Chapter 32

1 When the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered around Aaron and said to him, “Arise, make for us gods who shall go before us. For this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt—we do not know what has become of him.”

2 Then Aaron said to them, “Take off the gold rings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.”

3 So all the people took off the gold rings that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.
4 He took them from their hand, fashioned it with a tool, and made it into a molten calf. Then they said, “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.”
5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. Then Aaron called out and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.”
6 So they rose early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to revel.

7 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go down, for your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.
8 They have turned aside quickly from the way that I commanded them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.’”

9 Then the LORD said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
10 Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may burn hot against them and that I may consume them. But of you I will make a great nation.”

11 But Moses implored the LORD his God and said, “O LORD, why does Your wrath burn hot against Your people, whom You brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
12 Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent He brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from Your fierce wrath and relent from the harm against Your people.
13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Yourself and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring like the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’”

14 Then the LORD relented from the harm that He said He would do to His people.
15 Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets written on both sides—on one side and on the other they were written.
16 The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.

17 When Joshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a sound of war in the camp.”
18 But he said, “It is not the sound of shouting for victory, nor the sound of crying for defeat, but the sound of singing that I hear.”
19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, that Moses’ anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain.

20 Then he took the calf they had made and burned it with fire, ground it to powder, scattered it upon the water, and made the sons of Israel drink it.

21 Then Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you, that you brought upon them such a great sin?”

22 And Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn hot. You know the people—that they are bent on evil.
23 They said to me, ‘Make for us gods who shall go before us, for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt—we do not know what has become of him.’

24 So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off.’ Then they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.”

25 When Moses saw that the people were out of control—for Aaron had let them get out of control, to become a derision among their enemies—
26 Moses stood at the gate of the camp and said, “Whoever is for the LORD, come to me!” Then all the sons of Levi gathered to him.
27 And he said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Every man put his sword on his side, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbor.”

28 So the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And that day about three thousand men of the people fell.
29 And Moses said, “Today you have been ordained to the LORD, each man at the cost of his son and of his brother, so that He may bestow a blessing upon you this day.”

30 And it came to pass the next day that Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”

31 So Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Alas, this people has committed a great sin. They have made for themselves gods of gold.
32 Yet now, if You will forgive their sin, then forgive it; but if not, blot me out of Your book that You have written.”

33 But the LORD said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.
34 But now go, lead the people to the place about which I spoke to you. Behold, My angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, on the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.”

35 Then the LORD struck the people with a plague, because they and Aaron had made the calf.


Chapter 33

1 And the LORD said to Moses, “Go, ascend from here—you and the people whom you brought up from the land of Egypt—to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your seed.’
2 And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
3 Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up in your midst, lest I consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.”

4 When the people heard this harsh word, they mourned, and no man put on his ornaments.
5 And the LORD said to Moses, “Say to the sons of Israel, ‘You are a stiff-necked people; if for one moment I were to go up in your midst, I would consume you. But now, take off your ornaments from yourselves, that I may know what I will do to you.’”

6 So the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward.
7 Now Moses would take the tent and pitch it for himself outside the camp, far from the camp, and he called it the Tent of Meeting. And everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the Tent of Meeting which was outside the camp.
8 And it would happen that when Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand, each man at the entrance of his tent, and they would look after Moses until he entered the tent.
9 And when Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the LORD would speak with Moses.
10 And all the people would see the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, and all the people would rise and bow down, each man at the entrance of his tent.
11 And the LORD would speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks with his friend. Then he would return to the camp, but his attendant Joshua son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tent.

12 And Moses said to the LORD, “See, You say to me, ‘Bring up this people,’ but You have not made known to me whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have found favor in My eyes.’
13 Now therefore, if I have indeed found favor in Your eyes, please make known to me Your ways, that I may know You, in order that I may find favor in Your eyes. And consider also that this nation is Your people.”
14 And He said, “My presence will go, and I will give you rest.”
15 And he said to Him, “If Your presence does not go, do not bring us up from here.
16 For how then will it be known that I have found favor in Your eyes—I and Your people—unless You go with us? Then we will be distinct—I and Your people—from every other people who is on the face of the earth.”
17 And the LORD said to Moses, “Also this thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in My eyes, and I know you by name.”

18 Then he said, “Please show me Your glory.”

19 And He said, “I will cause all My goodness to pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion.”
20 But He said, “You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live.”
21 And the LORD said, “Look, here is a place close to Me, and you shall stand on the rock.
22 And it shall come to pass, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock and will cover you with My hand until I have passed by.
23 Then I will remove My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.”


Chapter 34

1 And the LORD said to Moses, “Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
2 Be ready by morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me on top of the mountain.
3 And no man shall come up with you, and no man shall be seen throughout all the mountain. Even the flocks and the herds shall not graze in front of that mountain.”

4 So he cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and Moses rose early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone.
5 And the LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and He called upon the name of the LORD.

6 And the LORD passed before him and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loyalty and truth,
7 keeping loyal love to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons and on the sons of sons, to the third and the fourth generation.”
8 And Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the ground and worshiped.
9 And he said, “If I have now found favor in Your eyes, O Lord, let the Lord please go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people. Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your possession.”

10 And He said, “Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will do wonders such as have not been created in all the earth nor in any nation, and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD, for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.
11 Observe what I command you today. Behold, I am driving out from before you the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
12 Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, lest they become a snare in your midst.
13 But you shall tear down their altars, and break their pillars, and cut down their Asherim.
14 For you shall not bow yourself down to another god, for the LORD — whose name is Jealous — is a jealous God.
15 Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they whore after their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and one invites you and you eat of his sacrifice,
16 and you take from their daughters for your sons, and their daughters whore after their gods and make your sons whore after their gods.

17 You shall not make for yourself molten gods.

18 You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Aviv — for in the month of Aviv you came out of Egypt.

19 Every firstborn male is Mine, even every firstborn of your livestock, whether ox or sheep.
20 But the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, you shall break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And no man shall appear before Me empty-handed.

21 Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest. In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.

22 And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks — the firstfruits of wheat harvest — and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
23 Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.
24 For I will dispossess nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no man shall covet your land when you go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.

25 You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with anything leavened, and the sacrifice of the Feast of Passover shall not remain until morning.
26 The first of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.
27 And the LORD said to Moses, “Write these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”
28 So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he ate no bread and drank no water. And He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant — the Ten Words.
29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai — with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses’ hand as he came down from the mountain — that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had spoken with Him.
30 And when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, they saw that the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
31 But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke to them.
32 And afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he commanded them all that the LORD had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.
33 And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
34 But whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the sons of Israel what had been commanded,
35 the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone. And Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with Him.

Chapter 35

1 Moses assembled all the congregation of the sons of Israel and said to them, “These are the things that the LORD has commanded, to do them.  
2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.  
3 You shall not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath day.”  

4 And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, “This is the thing that the LORD has commanded, saying,  
5 ‘Take from among you a contribution to the LORD. Whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it as the LORD’s contribution: gold, silver, and bronze,  
6 and blue and purple and scarlet yarn, fine linen and goats’ hair,  
7 and rams’ skins dyed red, and hides of sea cows, and acacia wood,  
8 and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,  
9 and onyx stones and stones for setting, for the ephod and for the breastpiece.’  

10 “And let every wise-hearted man among you come and make all that the LORD has commanded:  
11 the tabernacle, its tent and its covering, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its bases;  
12 the ark and its poles, the mercy seat, and the veil of the screen;  
13 the table and its poles, and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;  
14 and the lampstand also for the light, with its utensils and its lamps, and the oil for the light;  
15 and the altar of incense and its poles, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the entrance at the door of the tabernacle;  
16 the altar of burnt offering, with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin and its stand;  
17 the hangings of the court, its pillars and its bases, and the screen for the gate of the court;  
18 the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court, and their cords;  
19 the woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to serve as priests.”  

20 Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from before Moses.  
21 And every man whose heart stirred him and every one whose spirit made him willing brought the LORD’s contribution for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments.  
22 And they came, both men and women, all who were willing of heart, brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and necklaces, all kinds of gold jewelry — every man who offered a wave offering of gold to the LORD.  
23 And every man who had blue or purple or scarlet yarn, or fine linen, or goats’ hair, or rams’ skins dyed red, or hides of sea otters, brought them.  
24 Everyone who could make a contribution of silver or bronze brought it as the LORD’s contribution, and everyone who had acacia wood for any of the work of the service brought it.  
25 And every wise-hearted woman spun with her hands, and brought what she had spun, blue and purple and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.  
26 And all the women whose hearts stirred them in wisdom spun the goats’ hair.  
27 And the leaders brought onyx stones and stones for setting, for the ephod and for the breastpiece,  
28 and the spices and the oil for the light, and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.  
29 Every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work which the LORD had commanded to be done by the hand of Moses — the sons of Israel brought a freewill offering to the LORD.  

30 Then Moses said to the sons of Israel, “See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.  
31 And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of craftsmanship,  
32 to devise artistic designs, to work in gold and silver and bronze,  
33 and in the cutting of stones for setting, and in the carving of wood, to work in every kind of artistic craftsmanship.  
34 And He has put in his heart the ability to teach, both he and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.  
35 He has filled them with skill to do every sort of work done by an engraver or by a designer or by an embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, or by a weaver — as those who do every sort of work and devise artistic designs.”


Chapter 36

1 Then Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise-hearted man in whom the LORD has placed wisdom and understanding, to know how to do all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD has commanded.
2 And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man in whose heart the LORD had placed wisdom, everyone whose heart stirred him up to approach the work to do it.
3 And they took from Moses all the contribution which the sons of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to do it. And they continued bringing to him voluntary gifts every morning.
4 And all the wise men who were doing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work he was doing,
5 and they said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough for the service of the work which the LORD commanded to do.”
6 So Moses gave a command, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, “Let no man or woman do any more work for the contribution for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing.
7 For the material they had was sufficient for all the work to do it—even too much.

8 And every wise-hearted man among those doing the work made the tabernacle of ten curtains of fine twisted linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet yarns; with cherubim, the work of a skillful craftsman, he made them.
9 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width four cubits; all the curtains had one measure.
10 And he joined five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he joined to one another.
11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of the curtain at the end of the first set; likewise he did on the edge of the end curtain in the second set.
12 He made fifty loops on one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite one another.
13 And he made fifty clasps of gold and joined the curtains one to another with the clasps; so the tabernacle became one.

14 And he made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains.
15 The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the width of each curtain; the eleven curtains had one measure.
16 And he joined five of the curtains separately and six of the curtains separately.
17 And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was at the end of the first set, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain of the second set.
18 And he made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together, that it might be one.

19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of fine leather above it.

20 And he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright.
21 The length of each board was ten cubits, and one and a half cubits the width of each board.
22 Each board had two tenons, joined one to another; thus he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.
23 And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward.
24 And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards—two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
25 And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards
26 and their forty sockets of silver—two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board.
27 And for the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.
28 And he made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear.
29 And they were double beneath and in the same way they were entire to the top, to one ring; thus he did to both of them, for the two corners.
30 And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets—two sockets under each board.
31 And he made bars of acacia wood: five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle,
32 and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle at the rear westward.
33 And he made the middle bar to pass through the midst of the boards from end to end.
34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and he made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and he overlaid the bars with gold.

35 And he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twisted linen; the work of a skillful craftsman he made it, with cherubim.
36 And he made for it four pillars of acacia and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four sockets of silver.
37 And he made a screen for the entrance of the tent: of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer,
38 and its five pillars with their hooks. And he overlaid their tops and their bands with gold, but their five sockets were of bronze.


Chapter 37

1 Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood. Two and a half cubits was its length, one and a half cubits its width, and one and a half cubits its height.
2 He overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a gold molding around it.
3 He cast four rings of gold for it, for its four feet: two rings on one side of it and two rings on the other side.
4 He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
5 He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark.

6 He made a cover of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.
7 He made two cherubim of gold. He made them of hammered work, at the two ends of the cover.
8 One cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end; from the cover he made the cherubim at its two ends.
9 The cherubim spread out their wings above, covering the cover with their wings. Their faces were toward each other; the faces of the cherubim were turned toward the cover.

10 He made the table of acacia wood. Two cubits was its length, one cubit its width, and one and a half cubits its height.
11 He overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it.
12 He made a rim around it, a handbreadth wide, and made a gold molding around the rim.
13 He cast for it four rings of gold and fastened the rings to the four corners at its four legs.
14 The rings were close to the rim, as holders for the poles to carry the table.
15 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table.
16 He made the vessels that were on the table—its dishes, its pans, its bowls, and its jars for pouring—with pure gold.

17 He made the lampstand of pure gold. Of hammered work he made the lampstand—its base and its shaft, its cups, its calyxes, and its blossoms were of one piece with it.
18 Six branches came out of its sides, three branches of the lampstand out of one side and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side.
19 Three cups shaped like almond blossoms on one branch, with calyx and blossom, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms on the next branch, with calyx and blossom—the same for the six branches coming out of the lampstand.
20 On the lampstand itself were four cups shaped like almond blossoms, with calyxes and blossoms.
21 And a calyx was under the first pair of branches from it, and a calyx under the second pair of branches from it, and a calyx under the third pair of branches from it, for the six branches coming out of it.
22 Their calyxes and their branches were of one piece with it; all of it was a single piece of hammered work of pure gold.
23 He made its seven lamps, its tongs, and its trays of pure gold.
24 He made it and all its utensils out of a talent of pure gold.

25 He made the altar of incense of acacia wood. A cubit was its length and a cubit its width—it was square—and two cubits its height. Its horns were of one piece with it.
26 He overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns. And he made a gold molding for it all around.
27 He made two rings of gold for it under its molding, on two sides—on opposite sides—as holders for the poles to carry it.
28 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
29 He made the holy anointing oil and the pure fragrant incense, blended as by a perfumer.


Chapter 38

1 He made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood. Five cubits was its length and five cubits its width—it was square—and three cubits its height.
2 He made its horns on its four corners; its horns were of one piece with it. And he overlaid it with bronze.
3 He made all the utensils of the altar: the pots, the shovels, the basins, the forks, and the firepans. All its utensils he made of bronze.
4 He made for the altar a grate of bronze mesh, beneath its ledge, reaching halfway up.
5 He cast four rings on the four corners of the bronze grate, as holders for the poles.
6 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
7 He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, to carry it. He made it hollow, with boards.

8 He made the basin of bronze, and its base of bronze, from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

9 He made the courtyard. For the south side, the hangings of the courtyard were of fine twisted linen, a hundred cubits long.
10 Its twenty pillars and their twenty bases were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
11 And for the north side, a hundred cubits, their twenty pillars and their twenty bases were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
12 And for the west side there were hangings of fifty cubits, with their ten pillars and their ten bases. The hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
13 And for the east side, fifty cubits—
14 fifteen cubits of hangings on the one side, with their three pillars and their three bases,
15 and fifteen cubits of hangings on the other side of the gate of the courtyard, with their three pillars and their three bases.
16 All the hangings of the courtyard all around were of fine twisted linen.
17 The bases for the pillars were of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver; the overlaying of their capitals was of silver; and all the pillars of the courtyard were banded with silver.

18 And the screen of the gate of the courtyard was the work of an embroiderer, of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine twisted linen. Twenty cubits was the length, and the height in width was five cubits, corresponding to the hangings of the courtyard.
19 Their four pillars and their four bases were of bronze. Their hooks were of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their bands were of silver.
20 All the pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard all around were of bronze.

21 These are the records of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were recorded by the command of Moses, the service of the Levites under the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
22 Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
23 And with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman and embroiderer and weaver, in blue and purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen.

24 All the gold that was used for all the work in all the work of the sanctuary—the gold of the wave offering—was twenty-nine talents and 730 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
25 And the silver from those of the congregation who were recorded was one hundred talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary—
26 a beka per head, that is, half a shekel, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for each one who passed over to those who were recorded, from twenty years old and upward, for 603,550 men.
27 The hundred talents of silver were for casting the bases of the sanctuary and the bases of the veil: one hundred bases from the hundred talents, one talent per base.
28 And of the 1,775 shekels, he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their capitals and made bands for them.

29 And the bronze of the wave offering was seventy talents and 2,400 shekels.
30 With it he made the bases for the entrance of the tent of meeting, and the bronze altar and the bronze grate for it and all the utensils of the altar,
31 and the bases around the courtyard and the bases of the gate of the courtyard, and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs around the courtyard.


Chapter 39

1 From the blue and purple and scarlet yarn they made finely woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary. They made the holy garments for Aaron, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

2 He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine twisted linen.
3 They hammered the gold into thin sheets and cut it into threads, to work into the blue and purple and scarlet yarn and the fine linen, skillfully done.
4 They made shoulder-pieces for the ephod, joined to it at its two edges.
5 And the skillfully woven band of the ephod that was on it was of one piece with it, and of the same workmanship—of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine twisted linen—as the LORD had commanded Moses.

6 They made the onyx stones enclosed in gold filigree settings, engraved like the engravings of a signet, with the names of the sons of Israel.
7 He set them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

8 He made the breastpiece, the work of a skillful craftsman, like the work of the ephod—of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine twisted linen.
9 It was square; they made the breastpiece doubled, a span in length and a span in width when doubled.
10 And they set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and emerald was the first row;
11 and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;
12 and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
13 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in gold filigree settings.
14 The stones were corresponding to the names of the sons of Israel—twelve, according to their names, engraved like signets, each with its name, for the twelve tribes.

15 They made on the breastpiece braided chains like cords, of pure gold.
16 And they made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and set the two rings on the two edges of the breastpiece.
17 And they put the two braided chains of gold into the two rings at the edges of the breastpiece.
18 The other two ends of the two braided chains they attached to the two filigree settings. And they fastened them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod at the front.
19 They made two rings of gold and set them at the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inside edge next to the ephod.
20 They made two other rings of gold and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, at its front, close to its seam, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.
21 And they bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it lay above the skillfully woven band of the ephod, so that the breastpiece would not come loose from the ephod, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

22 He made the robe of the ephod, woven all of blue.
23 And the opening of the robe in the middle of it was like the opening of a garment, with a binding around the opening, so that it would not tear.
24 On the hem of the robe they made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine twisted linen.
25 And they made bells of pure gold and put the bells between the pomegranates all around the hem of the robe, between the pomegranates—
26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate around the hem of the robe for ministering, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

27 They made the tunics of fine linen, woven work, for Aaron and for his sons,
28 and the turban of fine linen, and the headdresses of fine linen, and the undergarments of fine twisted linen,
29 and the sash of fine twisted linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, the work of an embroiderer, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

30 They made the plate of the holy diadem of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription like the engraving of a signet: “Holy to the LORD.”
31 And they tied to it a blue cord to fasten it on the turban above, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

32 Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished. And the sons of Israel did according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did.

33 Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses—the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its bases;
34 and the covering of ram skins dyed red, and the covering of fine leather, and the veil of the screen;
35 the ark of the testimony with its poles, and the cover;
36 the table, all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
37 the pure lampstand, its lamps—the lamps to be set in order—and all its utensils, and the oil for the light;
38 and the golden altar, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the entrance of the tent;
39 the bronze altar, and its grating of bronze, its poles and all its utensils, the basin and its base;
40 the hangings of the courtyard, its pillars and its bases, and the screen for the gate of the courtyard, its cords and its pegs, and all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
41 the finely woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons for serving as priests.

42 According to all that the LORD had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel had done all the work.
43 Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it; just as the LORD had commanded, so they had done. And Moses blessed them.


Chapter 40

1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
3 You shall put in it the ark of the testimony, and you shall screen the ark with the veil.
4 You shall bring in the table and arrange what belongs on it, and you shall bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.
5 You shall place the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and set up the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle.
6 You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
7 You shall set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it.
8 You shall set up the courtyard all around and hang up the screen for the gate of the courtyard.

9 Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and you shall consecrate it and all its furnishings; and it shall be holy.
10 You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar; and the altar shall be most holy.
11 You shall anoint the basin and its base and consecrate it.
12 Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
13 You shall put the holy garments on Aaron and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may serve Me as priest.
14 You shall bring his sons and clothe them with tunics.
15 You shall anoint them just as you anointed their father, that they may serve Me as priests. Their anointing shall be for them an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.”

16 Moses did so; according to all that the LORD had commanded him, so he did.

17 Now in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.
18 Moses set up the tabernacle. He laid its bases, set up its boards, inserted its bars, and erected its pillars.
19 He spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent over it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
20 He took the testimony and put it into the ark, and put the poles on the ark, and set the cover on top of the ark.
21 He brought the ark into the tabernacle, set up the veil for the screen, and screened off the ark of the testimony, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

22 He put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil.
23 He arranged the bread on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
24 He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle.
25 He set up the lamps before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
26 He placed the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil.
27 He burned fragrant incense on it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
28 He set up the screen at the entrance of the tabernacle.
29 He placed the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
30 He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.
31 From it Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet.
32 When they went into the tent of meeting and when they came near the altar, they washed, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
33 He set up the courtyard all around the tabernacle and the altar and hung up the screen for the gate of the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.

34 Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
35 Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
36 Throughout all their journeys, whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel would set out.
37 But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the day it was taken up.
38 For the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.

Leviticus

Chapter 1

1 Then the LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When any man among you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering from the livestock, from the herd or from the flock.
3 If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish. He shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, so that he may be accepted before the LORD.
4 He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for himself.
5 Then he shall slaughter the bull before the LORD, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall bring the blood and throw the blood against the sides of the altar that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
6 Then he shall skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces.
7 The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
8 Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head and the fat, on the wood that is on the fire on the altar.
9 But its entrails and its legs he shall wash with water, and the priest shall burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.

10 If his gift for a burnt offering is from the flock, from the sheep or the goats, he shall bring a male without blemish.
11 He shall slaughter it on the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall throw its blood against the sides of the altar.
12 Then he shall cut it into pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood that is on the fire on the altar.
13 But the entrails and the legs he shall wash with water, and the priest shall offer all of it and burn it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.

14 If his offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or of young pigeons.
15 The priest shall bring it to the altar and wring off its head and burn it on the altar. Its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar.
16 He shall remove its crop with its contents and cast it beside the altar on the east side, in the place for ashes.
17 He shall tear it open by its wings, but shall not sever it completely. Then the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.


Chapter 2

1 When a man presents a grain offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour. He shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it.
2 Then he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests. And he shall take from it a handful of its fine flour and of its oil, with all its frankincense, and the priest shall burn this as its memorial portion on the altar, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3 But the remainder of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the food offerings to the LORD.

4 When you bring as a grain offering baked goods from the oven, it shall be of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.
5 If your offering is a grain offering baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil.
6 You shall break it in pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
7 If your offering is a grain offering cooked in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
8 And you shall bring the grain offering that is made of these things to the LORD, and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar.
9 The priest shall take from the grain offering its memorial portion and burn it on the altar, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
10 But the remainder of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the food offerings to the LORD.

11 No grain offering that you bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven, for you shall burn no leaven nor any honey as a food offering to the LORD.
12 As an offering of firstfruits you may bring them to the LORD, but they shall not be offered on the altar for a pleasing aroma.
13 You shall season all your grain offerings with salt. You shall not let the salt of the covenant of your God be lacking from your grain offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt.

14 If you offer a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the grain offering of your firstfruits fresh heads of grain roasted in fire, crushed fresh grain.
15 And you shall put oil on it and lay frankincense on it; it is a grain offering.
16 And the priest shall burn as its memorial portion some of the crushed grain and some of the oil with all of its frankincense. It is a food offering to the LORD.


Chapter 3

1 If a man’s offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, if he offers an animal from the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.
2 He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And Aaron’s sons the priests shall throw the blood against the sides of the altar.
3 From the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall offer as a food offering to the LORD the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
4 and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys.
5 Then Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar on top of the burnt offering, which is on the wood on the fire. It is a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.

6 If his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD is from the flock, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.
7 If he offers a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it before the LORD,
8 lay his hand on the head of his offering, and slaughter it in front of the tent of meeting. And Aaron’s sons shall throw its blood against the sides of the altar.
9 Then from the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall offer as a food offering to the LORD its fat: the fat tail, whole, removed close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
10 and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys.
11 And the priest shall burn it on the altar as a food offering to the LORD.

12 If his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD
13 and lay his hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the tent of meeting. And Aaron’s sons shall throw its blood against the sides of the altar.
14 Then he shall offer from it, as his offering, a food offering to the LORD: the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
15 and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys.
16 And the priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering with a pleasing aroma. All fat is the LORD’s.

17 It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations, in all your dwelling places, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood.


Chapter 4

1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If a person sins unintentionally in any of the LORD’s commandments that should not be done, and does any one of them—
3 if it is the anointed priest who sins, thus bringing guilt on the people—then he shall offer for the sin that he has committed a bull from the herd without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.
4 He shall bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before the LORD, and lay his hand on the head of the bull and slaughter the bull before the LORD.
5 And the anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it into the tent of meeting.
6 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle part of the blood seven times before the LORD in front of the veil of the sanctuary.
7 And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before the LORD that is in the tent of meeting, and all the rest of the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
8 And all the fat of the bull of the sin offering he shall remove from it: the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
9 and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys
10 (just as these are taken from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings); and the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.
11 But the skin of the bull and all its flesh, with its head, its legs, its entrails, and its dung—
12 all the rest of the bull—he shall carry outside the camp to a clean place, to the ash heap, and burn it on a fire of wood. On the ash heap it shall be burned.

13 If the whole congregation of Israel sins unintentionally, and the matter is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they do any of the things that by the LORD’s commandments ought not to be done, and they incur guilt—
14 when the sin which they have committed becomes known, the assembly shall offer a bull from the herd for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting.
15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the LORD, and the bull shall be slaughtered before the LORD.
16 Then the anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull into the tent of meeting,
17 and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil.
18 And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before the LORD in the tent of meeting, and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
19 And all its fat he shall take from it and burn on the altar.
20 Thus shall he do with the bull. As he did with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this. And the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
21 And he shall carry the bull outside the camp and burn it, as he burned the first bull. It is a sin offering for the assembly.

22 When a leader sins, doing unintentionally any one of all the things that by the LORD’s commandments ought not to be done, and comes to realize his guilt—
23 or the sin that he has committed is made known to him—he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish,
24 and shall lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the LORD. It is a sin offering.
25 Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
26 And all its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. So the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, and he shall be forgiven.

27 If any one of the common men sins unintentionally in doing any one of the things that by the LORD’s commandments ought not to be done, and he comes to realize his guilt—
28 or the sin that he has committed is made known to him—he shall bring as his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for the sin which he has committed.
29 And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.
30 And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
31 And all its fat he shall remove, as the fat is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a pleasing aroma to the LORD. And the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.

32 If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring a female without blemish
33 and lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it as a sin offering in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering.
34 Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
35 And all its fat he shall remove, as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar with the offerings by fire to the LORD. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.


Chapter 5

1 If a man sins by hearing a public charge to testify when he is a witness, whether he has seen or known it, if he does not speak, he shall bear his guilt.

2 Or if a man touches any unclean thing—whether the carcass of an unclean beast or of unclean livestock or of unclean swarming things—and it is hidden from him, and he becomes unclean, and he realizes his guilt;
3 or if he touches human uncleanness—whatever uncleanness by which a man becomes unclean—and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it and realizes his guilt;
4 or if a man utters a careless oath, to do evil or to do good, whatever a man may speak rashly with an oath, and it is hidden from him—when he comes to know it and realizes his guilt in one of these things—
5 when he realizes his guilt in any of these and confesses the sin he has committed,
6 then he shall bring to the LORD as his guilt offering for the sin he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin.

7 But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to the LORD for his guilt offering for that which he has sinned, two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
8 He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the sin offering. He shall wring its head from its neck but shall not sever it completely,
9 and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.
10 Then he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to the rule. And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.

11 But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for the sin he has committed a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it and shall put no frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.
12 He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and burn it on the altar, on the LORD’s food offerings. It is a sin offering.
13 Thus the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin he has committed in any one of these things, and he shall be forgiven. And the remainder shall be for the priest, as with the grain offering.

14 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
15 “If a man acts unfaithfully and sins unintentionally in regard to the LORD’s holy things, then he shall bring as his guilt offering to the LORD a ram without blemish from the flock, valued in silver shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering.
16 And he shall make restitution for what he has done wrong in regard to the holy thing, and shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest. Then the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven.

17 If a man sins and does any of the things that the LORD has commanded not to be done, even if he did not know it, he is still guilty and shall bear his guilt.
18 He shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish from the flock, valued as a guilt offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him for the mistake that he made unintentionally, and he shall be forgiven.
19 It is a guilt offering; he has indeed incurred guilt before the LORD.


Chapter 6

1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “If a man sins and acts unfaithfully against the LORD by deceiving his fellow in regard to a deposit or security entrusted to him, or through robbery, or if he has oppressed his fellow,
3 or has found lost property and lied about it, and swears falsely—in any of all the things that a man does to sin thereby—
4 then it shall be, when he has sinned and is guilty, that he shall return what he has stolen, or what he has taken by oppression, or the deposit that was entrusted to him, or the lost property that he found,
5 or anything about which he has sworn falsely. He shall restore it in full, and add a fifth to it; he shall give it to the one to whom it belongs on the day he presents his guilt offering.
6 Then he shall bring to the priest his guilt offering to the LORD: a ram without blemish from the flock, or its equivalent, for a guilt offering.
7 And the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and he shall be forgiven for any of the things he may have done to incur guilt.”

8 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
9 “Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall remain on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it.
10 And the priest shall put on his linen robe, and he shall put on linen undergarments over his flesh. Then he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has reduced the burnt offering on the altar, and place them beside the altar.
11 Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
12 The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not go out. The priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall arrange the burnt offering on it, and burn the fat of the peace offerings on it.
13 Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.

14 This is the law of the grain offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, in front of the altar.
15 And one shall take from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering and of its oil, and all the frankincense that is on the grain offering, and shall burn this as its memorial portion on the altar, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
16 And the remainder of it Aaron and his sons shall eat; it shall be eaten unleavened in a holy place. In the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
17 It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion from my food offerings. It is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
18 Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat it, as a perpetual statute throughout your generations, from the LORD’s food offerings. Whatever touches them shall become holy.”

19 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
20 “This is the offering that Aaron and his sons shall offer to the LORD on the day when he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.
21 It shall be made with oil on a griddle. You shall bring it well mixed, baked pieces of the grain offering you shall offer, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
22 The priest from among Aaron’s sons, who is anointed to succeed him, shall offer it. It is a perpetual statute before the LORD. It shall be wholly burned.
23 Every grain offering of a priest shall be wholly burned; it shall not be eaten.”

24 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
25 “Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin offering be slaughtered before the LORD. It is most holy.
26 The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the tent of meeting.
27 Whatever touches its flesh shall be holy, and if any of its blood is spattered on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was spattered in a holy place.
28 And the earthenware vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. But if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
29 Every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy.
30 But no sin offering shall be eaten from which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; it shall be burned with fire.


Chapter 7

1 This is the law of the guilt offering. It is most holy.
2 In the place where they slaughter the burnt offering they shall slaughter the guilt offering, and its blood shall be dashed against the sides of the altar.
3 And all its fat shall be offered: the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails,
4 the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys.
5 The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering to the LORD; it is a guilt offering.
6 Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most holy.
7 The guilt offering is like the sin offering; there is one law for them: the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.

8 And the priest who offers any man’s burnt offering shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering that he has offered.
9 And every grain offering that is baked in the oven and all that is prepared in a pan or on a griddle shall belong to the priest who offers it.
10 And every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall be shared equally among all the sons of Aaron.

11 This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that one may offer to the LORD.
12 If he offers it for thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the thanksgiving sacrifice unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and cakes of fine flour well mixed with oil.
13 With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving he shall bring his offering with cakes of leavened bread.
14 And from it he shall offer one cake from each offering, as a gift to the LORD. It shall belong to the priest who dashes the blood of the peace offerings.
15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.

16 But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow offering or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten.
17 But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.
18 If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to him who offers it. It is tainted, and the person who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.

19 Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire. All who are clean may eat flesh,
20 but the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the LORD’s peace offerings while an uncleanness is on him, that person shall be cut off from his people.
21 And if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether human uncleanness or an unclean beast or any unclean swarming creature, and then eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the LORD’s peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from his people.

22 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
23 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, You shall eat no fat of ox or sheep or goat.
24 The fat of an animal that dies of itself and the fat of one that is torn by beasts may be put to any use, but on no account shall you eat it.
25 For every person who eats of the fat of an animal from which a food offering may be made to the LORD shall be cut off from his people.
26 Moreover, you shall eat no blood whatever, whether of bird or of beast, in any of your dwelling places.
27 Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.”

28 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
29 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Whoever offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the LORD shall bring his offering to the LORD from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
30 His own hands shall bring the LORD’s food offerings. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the LORD.
31 The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons.
32 And the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifice of your peace offerings.
33 The son of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh for his portion.
34 For the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed I have taken from the sons of Israel, from their sacrifices of peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual obligation that is due from the sons of Israel.

35 This is the portion for Aaron and his sons from the LORD’s food offerings, from the day they were presented to serve as priests of the LORD.
36 The LORD commanded this to be given them by the sons of Israel, from the day that he anointed them. It is a perpetual statute throughout their generations.

37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the grain offering, of the sin offering, of the guilt offering, of the ordination offering, and of the peace offering,
38 which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day that he commanded the sons of Israel to bring their offerings to the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.


Chapter 8

1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread,
3 and assemble all the congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.”
4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
5 And Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing that the LORD has commanded to be done.”
6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.
7 And he put on him the tunic and tied the sash around his waist and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him and tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod around him, binding it to him with the band.
8 And he placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.
9 And he set the turban on his head, and on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown, as the LORD commanded Moses.

10 Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.
11 And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.
12 And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him.
13 And Moses brought Aaron’s sons and clothed them with tunics and tied sashes around their waists and bound caps on them, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

14 Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.
15 And he slaughtered it, and Moses took the blood, and with his finger he put it on the horns of the altar around it and purified the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to make atonement for it.
16 And he took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar.
17 But the bull and its skin and its flesh and its dung he burned with fire outside the camp, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

18 Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
19 And he slaughtered it, and Moses threw the blood against the sides of the altar.
20 He cut the ram into pieces, and Moses burned the head and the pieces and the fat.
21 And he washed the entrails and the legs with water, and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

22 Then he presented the other ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
23 And he slaughtered it, and Moses took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
24 Then he presented Aaron’s sons, and Moses put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses cast the blood against the sides of the altar.
25 Then he took the fat and the fat tail and all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat and the right thigh,
26 and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD he took one unleavened loaf and one loaf of bread with oil and one wafer and placed them on the pieces of fat and on the right thigh.
27 And he put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons and waved them as a wave offering before the LORD.
28 Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD.
29 And Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before the LORD. It was Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination, as the LORD commanded Moses.

30 Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and also on his sons and his sons’ garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.

31 And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and eat it there and eat also the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’
32 And what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn with fire.
33 And you shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for it will take seven days to ordain you.
34 As has been done today, the LORD has commanded to be done to make atonement for you.
35 At the entrance of the tent of meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days, performing what the LORD has charged, so that you do not die, for so I have been commanded.”
36 And Aaron and his sons did all the things that the LORD commanded by Moses.


Chapter 9

1 On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
2 And he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a calf from the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
3 And say to the sons of Israel, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old and without blemish, for a burnt offering,
4 and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.’”
5 And they brought what Moses commanded in front of the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
6 And Moses said, “This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.”
7 Then Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and for the people. Then present the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded.”
8 So Aaron drew near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
9 And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.
10 But the fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses.
11 The flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.
12 Then he slaughtered the burnt offering, and Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar.
13 And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned them on the altar.
14 And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
15 Then he presented the people’s offering and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first one.
16 And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the rule.
17 And he presented the grain offering and took a handful of it and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.
18 Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people. And Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar.
19 But the fat pieces of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail and that which covers the entrails and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver—
20 they put the fat pieces on the breasts, and he burned the fat pieces on the altar.
21 But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses commanded.
22 Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.
23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
24 And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces.

Chapter 10

1 Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it, and they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them.
2 And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.
3 Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD spoke, saying, ‘Among those who are near me I will be treated with reverence, and before all the people I will be glorified.’” And Aaron was silent.

4 Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said to them, “Come, carry your brothers from the sanctuary outside the camp.”
5 So they came and carried them in their tunics outside the camp, as Moses had said.
6 And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, “Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not tear your garments, lest you die and wrath come upon all the congregation. But your brothers, the whole house of Israel, shall mourn for you over the burning that the LORD has kindled.
7 And you shall not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you.” And they did according to the word of Moses.

8 Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,
9 “Do not drink wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations,
10 so as to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,
11 and so that you are able to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.”

12 Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his surviving sons, “Take the grain offering that remains of the LORD’s offerings by fire and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.
13 You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons’ due from the LORD’s offerings by fire, for so I have been commanded.
14 And the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution offering you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons’ due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel.
15 The thigh of the contribution and the breast of the wave offering they shall bring with the offerings by fire of the fat, to wave as a wave offering before the LORD, and it shall be yours and your sons’ with you as a perpetual due, as the LORD has commanded.”

16 Now Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and found that it had been burned. And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying,
17 “Why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy place? For it is most holy, and He gave it to you to bear the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD.
18 Look here, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.”
19 But Aaron said to Moses, “Today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, such things like this have happened to me also. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in the sight of the LORD?”
20 And when Moses heard that, it was good in his sight.


Chapter 11

1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, These are the living things which you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth:
3 Whatever animal has a split hoof, completely divided, and chews the cud, you may eat.
4 Nevertheless, of those that chew the cud or divide the hoof, you shall not eat the camel, because it chews the cud but does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;
5 nor the hyrax, because it chews the cud but does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;
6 nor the hare, because it chews the cud but does not divide the hoof, it is unclean to you;
7 nor the pig, because it divides the hoof and is cloven-footed but does not chew the cud, it is unclean to you.
8 You shall not eat their flesh, and you shall not touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.

9 These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas and in the rivers, you may eat.
10 But whatever does not have fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers, of all that swarm in the waters and of all the living things that are in the waters, they are an abomination to you.
11 They shall be an abomination to you; you shall not eat their flesh, and you shall detest their carcasses.
12 Whatever water animal that does not have fins and scales is an abomination to you.

13 And these you shall detest among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,
14 the kite and the falcon according to its kind,
15 every raven according to its kind,
16 the ostrich, the owl, the gull and the hawk according to its kind,
17 the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl,
18, the white owl, the pelican, the carrion vulture,
19, the stork, the heron according to its kind, and the hoopoe and the bat.

20 All winged swarming things that go on all fours are an abomination to you.
21 Yet these you may eat of every winged swarming thing that goes on all fours, which have jointed legs above their feet, with which to leap on the earth.
22 These you may eat: the locust according to its kind, the bald locust according to its kind, the cricket according to its kind, and the grasshopper according to its kind.
23 But all other winged swarming things that have four feet are an abomination to you.

24 And by these you shall become unclean: whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
25 And whoever carries any part of their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
26 Every animal that has a split hoof but is not completely divided or does not chew the cud is unclean to you; everyone who touches them shall be unclean.
27 And whatever goes on its paws among all the animals that go on all fours, they are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
28 And the one who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.

29 And among the things that swarm on the earth, these are unclean to you: the mole rat, the mouse, the great lizard according to its kind,
30 the gecko, the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink, and the chameleon.
31 Among all that swarm, they are unclean to you; whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening.
32 And anything on which one of them falls when they are dead shall be unclean, whether it is any article of wood or clothing or skin or sack—any article that is used for any purpose—it shall be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; then it shall be clean.
33 And if any of them falls into an earthen vessel, whatever is in it shall be unclean, and you shall break it.
34 Any food that may be eaten which comes into contact with such water shall be unclean, and any drink that may be drunk from such a vessel shall be unclean.
35 And everything on which any part of their carcass falls shall be unclean: an oven or stove shall be broken down; they are unclean and shall be unclean to you.
36 Nevertheless, a spring or a cistern holding water shall be clean, but whoever touches their carcass in it shall be unclean.
37 And if any part of their carcass falls on any seed which is to be sown, it is clean.
38 But if water is put on the seed and any part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.

39 And if any animal which you may eat dies, whoever touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
40 And whoever eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. And whoever carries its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.

41 And every thing that swarms on the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
42 Whatever goes on its belly and whatever goes on all fours or whatever has many feet among all the things that swarm on the earth, you shall not eat them, for they are an abomination.
43 Do not make yourselves detestable with any thing that swarms, and you shall not make yourselves unclean with them and become unclean by them.
44 For I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy, for I am holy. And you shall not defile yourselves with any swarming thing that moves on the earth.
45 For I am the LORD who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God. You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.

46 This is the law about the animals and the birds and every living creature that moves in the waters and every creature that swarms on the earth,
47 to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living creature that may be eaten and the living creature that may not be eaten.


Chapter 12

1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If a woman conceives and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean for seven days; as in the days of her menstrual impurity, she shall be unclean.
3 And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
4 Then she shall continue in the blood of her purification for thirty-three days. She shall not touch anything holy, and she shall not come into the sanctuary until the days of her purification are completed.

5 But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as in her menstruation, and she shall continue in the blood of her purification for sixty-six days.

6 And when the days of her purification are completed, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting a lamb a year old for a burnt offering and a pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering.
7 And he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her, and she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This is the law for a woman who bears a child, either male or female.

8 And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering, and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.


Chapter 13

1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
2 “When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling or a scab or a bright spot, and it becomes an infection of leprosy on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests.
3 And the priest shall examine the infection on the skin of the body, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a leprous infection; when the priest has seen it, he shall pronounce him unclean.
4 But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair has not turned white, then the priest shall quarantine the infected person for seven days.
5 And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and behold, if in his eyes the infection remains unchanged and the infection has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall quarantine him for seven more days.
6 And the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is a scab. He shall wash his clothes and be clean.

7 But if the scab spreads further on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again before the priest.
8 And the priest shall examine him, and if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.

9 When the infection of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest,
10 and the priest shall examine him, and if there is a white swelling on the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling,
11 it is a chronic leprosy on the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not quarantine him, for he is unclean.

12 And if the leprosy breaks out over the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the infected person from his head even to his feet, as far as the priest can see,
13 then the priest shall examine him, and if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce clean him who has the infection; it has all turned white, and he is clean.
14 But whenever raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.
15 And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean; the raw flesh is unclean, it is leprosy.
16 Or if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest,
17 and the priest shall examine him, and if the infection has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the infected person clean; he is clean.

18 And when the body has a boil on the skin and it is healed,
19 and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a reddish-white bright spot, then it shall be shown to the priest.
20 And the priest shall examine it, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy that has broken out in the boil.
21 But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in it, and it is not deeper than the skin and has faded, then the priest shall quarantine him seven days.
22 And if it spreads over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection.
23 But if the bright spot remains in its place and has not spread, it is a scar from the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

24 Or if the body sustains a burn on the skin by fire, and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a reddish-white or bright white spot,
25 then the priest shall examine it, and if the hair in the bright spot has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy that has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous infection.
26 But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the bright spot, and it is not deeper than the skin and has faded, then the priest shall quarantine him seven days.
27 And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day. If it spreads on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy.
28 But if the bright spot remains in its place and has not spread on the skin and has faded, it is the swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar from the burn.

29 And when a man or woman has an infection on the head or on the beard,
30 then the priest shall examine the infection, and behold, if it appears to be deeper than the skin and there is in it thin yellow hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an itch, a leprous disease of the head or the beard.
31 But if the priest examines the infection and there appears to be no depth in it and no black hair in it, then the priest shall quarantine the infected person for seven days.
32 And on the seventh day the priest shall examine the infection, and if the itch has not spread and there is no yellow hair in it and the itch does not appear to be deeper than the skin,
33 then he shall shave himself, but he shall not shave the itch. And the priest shall quarantine the person with the itch for another seven days.
34 Then on the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch, and if the itch has not spread on the skin and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
35 But if the itch spreads on the skin after his cleansing,
36 then the priest shall examine him, and if the itch has spread on the skin, the priest need not look for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
37 But if in his eyes the itch has remained and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed, and he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

38 And when a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, bright white spots,
39 then the priest shall examine them, and behold, if the bright spots on the skin of the body are a dull white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin; he is clean.

40 If a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald; he is clean.
41 And if the hair falls out from the front of his head, he is bald on the forehead; he is clean.
42 But if on the bald head or the bald forehead there is a reddish-white infection, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or on his bald forehead.
43 Then the priest shall examine him, and if the swelling of the infection is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body,
44 he is a leprous man; he is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his infection is on his head.

45 And the leper who has the infection, his clothes shall be torn and the hair of his head shall hang loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out, ‘Unclean, unclean.’
46 All the days during which the infection is in him he shall remain unclean. He is unclean; he shall dwell alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.

47 When there is a garment with a leprous disease in it, whether it is a wool or linen garment,
48 whether in the warp or woof of linen or wool, or in a leather article or anything made of leather,
49 and the infection is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of leather, it is a leprous disease and shall be shown to the priest.
50 Then the priest shall examine the infection and quarantine the infected article for seven days.
51 And he shall examine the infection on the seventh day. If the infection has spread in the garment, in the warp or in the woof, or in the leather, whatever its use, the infection is a persistent leprous disease; it is unclean.
52 So he shall burn the garment, the warp or the woof, the wool or the linen, or any article of leather in which the infection is, for it is a persistent leprous disease; it shall be burned in the fire.

53 But if the priest examines it and the infection has not spread in the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of leather,
54 then the priest shall command them to wash the thing in which the infection is, and he shall quarantine it for seven more days.
55 Then the priest shall examine the infection after it has been washed, and if the infection has not changed in appearance though the infection has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire. It is a fungus, whether on the inside or the outside.
56 But if the priest looks, and sees that the infection has faded after it has been washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment or the leather or the warp or the woof.
57 And if it appears again in the garment, in the warp or the woof, or in any article of leather, it is breaking out; you shall burn the infected item in the fire.
58 And the garment or the warp or the woof or any article of leather which has been washed and the infection has departed from them shall be washed a second time and shall be clean.

59 This is the law for a leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen, in warp or woof or any article of leather, for pronouncing it clean or unclean.


Chapter 14

1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “This shall be the law of the leper on the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest,
3 and the priest shall go outside the camp. Then the priest shall examine him, and if the leprous disease is healed in the leper,
4 the priest shall command that two live clean birds be taken for him who is to be cleansed, and cedarwood and scarlet yarn and hyssop.
5 And the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over fresh water.
6 As for the live bird, he shall take it, and the cedarwood and the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water.
7 Then he shall sprinkle it seven times on him who is to be cleansed of the leprous disease. Then he shall pronounce him clean and shall let the live bird go free in the open field.

8 He who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean. After that he shall come into the camp, but shall live outside his tent seven days.
9 And on the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair from his head, his beard, and his eyebrows. He shall shave off all his hair, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.

10 On the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, and one log of oil.
11 And the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed and these things before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
12 Then the priest shall take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.
13 And he shall kill the lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary—for the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy.
14 Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
15 Then the priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand,
16 and dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.
17 And some of the oil that remains in his hand the priest shall put on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering.
18 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD.

19 The priest shall offer the sin offering, to make atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. Then afterward he shall kill the burnt offering.
20 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

21 But if he is poor and cannot afford so much, then he shall take one male lamb for a guilt offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and a log of oil;
22 also two turtledoves or two pigeons, whichever he can afford. One shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.
23 And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, before the LORD.
24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.
25 And he shall kill the lamb of the guilt offering. And the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
26 And the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand,
27 and shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD.
28 And the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the lobe of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, in the place where the blood of the guilt offering was put.
29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD.
30 And he shall offer one of the turtledoves or pigeons, whichever he can afford,
31 one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering along with the grain offering. And the priest shall make atonement before the LORD for him who is to be cleansed.
32 This is the law for him in whom is a leprous disease, who cannot afford the offerings for his cleansing.

33 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
34 “When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, and I put a leprous disease in a house in the land of your possession,
35 then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, ‘There seems to me to be something like a disease in the house.’
36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes to examine the disease, lest all that is in the house be declared unclean. And afterward the priest shall go in to examine the house.
37 And he shall examine the disease, and if the disease is in the walls of the house with greenish or reddish spots, and it appears deeper than the wall,
38 then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house and quarantine the house for seven days.
39 And the priest shall come again on the seventh day and examine it, and if the disease has spread in the walls of the house,
40 then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the disease and throw them into an unclean place outside the city.
41 And he shall have the inside of the house scraped all around, and they shall pour out the plaster that they scrape off into an unclean place outside the city.
42 Then they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other plaster and replaster the house.

43 But if the disease breaks out again in the house after he has taken out the stones and scraped the house and it is plastered,
44 then the priest shall go and examine it. And if the disease has spread in the house, it is a persistent leprous disease in the house; it is unclean.
45 And he shall break down the house, its stones and timber and all the plaster of the house, and he shall carry them out of the city to an unclean place.

46 Moreover, he who goes into the house while it is quarantined shall be unclean until evening,
47 and he who sleeps in the house shall wash his clothes, and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.

48 But if the priest comes and examines it and behold, the disease has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, for the disease is healed.
49 And he shall take two birds, cedarwood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop to cleanse the house.
50 And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over fresh water,
51 and shall take the cedarwood and the hyssop and the scarlet yarn, along with the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
52 Thus he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the fresh water and with the live bird and with the cedarwood and the hyssop and the scarlet yarn.
53 Then he shall let the live bird go out of the city into the open field. So he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.

54 This is the law for any case of leprous disease: for an itch,
55 for leprosy in a garment or in a house,
56 and for a swelling or a scab or a bright spot,
57 to teach when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law of leprous disease.


Chapter 15

1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean.
3 This shall be his uncleanness in regard to his discharge: whether his body allows the discharge to flow or obstructs its flow, it is his uncleanness.

4 Every bed on which the one with the discharge lies shall be unclean, and everything on which he sits shall be unclean.
5 And anyone who touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
6 And he who sits on anything on which the one with the discharge has sat shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
7 And he who touches the body of the one with the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
8 And if the one with the discharge spits on him who is clean, then he also shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
9 Every saddle on which the one with the discharge rides shall be unclean.
10 And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until evening. And he who carries such things shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
11 And anyone whom the one with the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
12 An earthen vessel which the one with the discharge touches shall be broken, and every wooden vessel shall be rinsed in water.

13 When the one with the discharge is cleansed of his discharge, he shall count seven days for himself for his cleansing; then he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in fresh water, and he shall be clean.
14 On the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two pigeons and come before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest.
15 And the priest shall offer them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD for his discharge.

16 If a man has an emission of semen, he shall bathe all his body in water and be unclean until evening.
17 And every garment and every skin on which the semen is shall be washed with water and be unclean until evening.
18 When a man lies with a woman and has an emission of semen, they shall bathe in water and be unclean until evening.

19 When a woman has a discharge, and her discharge from her body is blood, she shall be in her menstrual impurity for seven days, and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening.
20 And everything on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean. Everything also on which she sits shall be unclean.
21 And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
22 And whoever touches anything on which she sits shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
23 Whether it is the bed or anything on which she sits, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until evening.
24 And if any man lies with her and her menstrual impurity is on him, he shall be unclean seven days, and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.

25 If a woman has a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her menstrual impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her impurity, all the days of her impure discharge she shall be as in the days of her menstrual impurity; she shall be unclean.
26 Every bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge shall be to her as the bed of her impurity; and everything on which she sits shall be unclean, as in the uncleanness of her impurity.
27 And whoever touches these things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
28 But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall count seven days, and afterward she shall be clean.
29 On the eighth day she shall take for herself two turtledoves or two pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
30 And the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement for her before the LORD for the uncleanness of her discharge.

31 Thus you shall separate the sons of Israel from their uncleanness, lest they die in their uncleanness by defiling my tabernacle that is in their midst.

32 This is the law for the one who has a discharge and for him who has an emission of semen, becoming unclean thereby,
33 and for her who is sick with her impurity and for the one who has a discharge, whether male or female, and for a man who lies with a woman who is unclean.


Chapter 16

1 The LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the LORD and died.
2 And the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron your brother not to come at any time into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the mercy seat that is on the ark, so that he may not die, for I appear in the cloud over the mercy seat.

3 But in this way Aaron shall come into the Holy Place: with a bull from the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
4 He shall put on the holy linen tunic and shall have the linen undergarment on his body. He shall tie the linen sash around his waist and wear the linen turban; these are the holy garments. He shall bathe his body in water and then put them on.
5 And he shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.

6 Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself and shall make atonement for himself and for his house.
7 Then he shall take the two goats and set them before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
8 And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other lot for Azazel.
9 And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot for the LORD fell and offer it as a sin offering.
10 But the goat on which the lot for Azazel fell shall be presented alive before the LORD to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel.

11 Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering for himself and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. He shall kill the bull of the sin offering for himself.
12 And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the LORD, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small, and he shall bring it inside the veil
13 and put the incense on the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the testimony, so that he does not die.
14 And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat on the east side, and in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.

15 Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it upon the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat.
16 Thus he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the sons of Israel and because of their transgressions, all their sins. And so he shall do for the tent of meeting, which dwells with them in the midst of their uncleanness.
17 No man shall be in the tent of meeting when he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his household and for all the assembly of Israel.
18 Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat and put it on the horns of the altar all around.
19 And he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times and cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the sons of Israel.

20 And when he has finished atoning for the Holy Place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat.
21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel and all their transgressions, all their sins. And he shall put them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness.
22 The goat shall bear all their iniquities on itself to a remote area, and he shall let the goat go free in the wilderness.

23 Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and shall take off the linen garments that he put on when he went into the Holy Place and shall leave them there.
24 And he shall bathe his body in water in a holy place and put on his garments and come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people.
25 And the fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar.
26 And he who lets the goat go to Azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.
27 And the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be carried outside the camp. Their skin and their flesh and their dung shall be burned with fire.
28 And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.

29 And this shall be a statute to you forever: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict yourselves and shall do no work, neither the native nor the stranger who sojourns among you.
30 For on this day shall atonement be made for you to cleanse you. You shall be clean before the LORD from all your sins.
31 It is a sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall afflict yourselves; it is a statute forever.
32 And the priest who is anointed and consecrated to serve as priest in his father's place shall make atonement, wearing the holy linen garments.
33 He shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
34 And this shall be a statute forever for you, that atonement may be made for the sons of Israel once in the year because of all their sins.” And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.


Chapter 17

1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, This is the thing that the LORD has commanded:

3 If any man of the house of Israel kills an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or kills it outside the camp,
4 and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it as a gift to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, bloodguilt shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people.
5 This is so that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices that they offer in the open field, that they may bring them to the LORD, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the priest, and offer them as peace offerings to the LORD.
6 And the priest shall throw the blood on the altar of the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting and burn the fat for a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
7 So they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to goat demons, after whom they whore. This shall be a statute forever for them throughout their generations.

8 And you shall say to them: Any man of the house of Israel, or of the foreigners who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice
9 and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it to the LORD, that man shall be cut off from his people.

10 If any man of the house of Israel or of the foreigners who sojourn among them eats any blood, I will set my face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people.
11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your lives, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.
12 This is why I have said to the sons of Israel, No person among you shall eat blood, nor shall any foreigner who lives among you eat blood.

13 Any man of the sons of Israel, or of the foreigners who live among them, who hunts any beast or bird that may be eaten shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust.
14 For the life of every creature is its blood: its life is in its blood. Therefore I have said to the sons of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.

15 And every person who eats what dies on its own or what is killed by beasts, whether he is a native or a foreigner, shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until evening; then he shall be clean.
16 But if he does not wash them or bathe his flesh, he shall bear his iniquity.


Chapter 18

1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, I am the LORD your God.
3 You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you lived, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. You shall not live by their customs.
4 You shall follow my rules and keep my statutes and walk in them. I am the LORD your God.
5 You shall therefore keep my statutes and my rules; if a man does them, he shall live by them. I am the LORD.

6 None of you shall approach any one of his close relatives to uncover nakedness. I am the LORD.
7 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is the nakedness of your mother; she is your mother, you shall not uncover her nakedness.
8 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife; it is your father’s nakedness.
9 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home or born abroad.
10 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, for their nakedness is your own.
11 You shall not uncover the nakedness of the daughter of your father’s wife, begotten by your father; she is your sister.
12 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister; she is your father’s flesh.
13 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s flesh.
14 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother. You shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt.
15 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife. You shall not uncover her nakedness.
16 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife; it is your brother’s nakedness.
17 You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter. You shall not take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter to uncover her nakedness; they are near relatives. It is depravity.
18 And you shall not take a woman as a rival wife to her sister, to uncover her nakedness while her sister is still alive.

19 You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness while she is in her menstrual uncleanness.
20 And you shall not lie sexually with your neighbor’s wife and so make yourself unclean with her.
21 You shall not give any of your children as an offering to Molech, and so profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.
22 You shall not lie with a man as with a woman; it is an abomination.
23 And you shall not lie with any beast and so make yourself unclean with it, and a woman shall not stand before a beast to mate with it; it is a perversion.

24 Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things, for by all these the nations I am driving out before you have become unclean.
25 And the land became unclean, so I punished its iniquity, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.
26 But you shall keep my statutes and my rules and do none of these abominations, either the native or the foreigner who lives among you
27 (for the men of the land, who were before you, did all these abominations so that the land became unclean),
28 lest the land vomit you out when you make it unclean, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.

29 For everyone who does any of these abominations, those persons who do them shall be cut off from among their people.
30 So keep my charge never to practice any of these abominable customs that were practiced before you, and never to make yourselves unclean by them. I am the LORD your God.


Chapter 19

1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.

3 Every man shall revere his mother and his father, and you shall keep my Sabbaths. I am the LORD your God.
4 Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods. I am the LORD your God.

5 When you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it so that it may be accepted.
6 It shall be eaten on the day you offer it or on the next day, and what remains until the third day shall be burned with fire.
7 If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is tainted; it shall not be accepted.
8 And everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned what is holy to the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from his people.

9 When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field to the edges, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.
10 And you shall not strip your vineyard bare, nor shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and for the foreigner. I am the LORD your God.

11 You shall not steal; you shall not deal falsely; you shall not lie to one another.
12 You shall not swear falsely by my name, and so profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.
13 You shall not oppress your neighbor or rob him. The wages of a hired man shall not remain with you all night until the morning.
14 You shall not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God. I am the LORD.

15 You shall do no injustice in judgment. You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but you shall judge your neighbor in righteousness.
16 You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand against the life of your neighbor. I am the LORD.

17 You shall not hate your brother in your heart, but you must rebuke your neighbor when he sins, lest you bear sin because of him.
18 You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD.

19 You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your livestock breed with a different kind. You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed, and you shall not wear a garment of cloth made of two kinds of material.

20 If a man lies sexually with a woman who is a slave, designated for another man but not yet redeemed or given her freedom, there shall be an investigation. They shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
21 And he shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, a ram for a guilt offering.
22 And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the LORD for his sin that he committed, and he shall be forgiven for the sin that he committed.

23 When you come into the land and plant any kind of tree for food, then you shall regard its fruit as forbidden. Three years it shall be forbidden to you; it shall not be eaten.
24 And in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the LORD.
25 But in the fifth year you may eat of its fruit, to increase its yield for you. I am the LORD your God.

26 You shall not eat any flesh with the blood in it. You shall not practice divination or sorcery.
27 You shall not round off the hair on your temples or mar the edges of your beard.
28 You shall not make cuts on your flesh for the dead or tattoo any marks upon you. I am the LORD.

29 Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, lest the land fall into prostitution and the land become full of depravity.
30 You shall keep my Sabbaths and revere my sanctuary. I am the LORD.

31 Do not turn to mediums or to those who consult spirits; do not seek them out, and so make yourselves unclean by them. I am the LORD your God.

32 You shall rise before the gray head and honor the face of the old man, and you shall fear your God. I am the LORD.

33 When a foreigner sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong.
34 The foreigner who sojourns with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.

35 You shall do no wrong in judgment, in measures of length or weight or quantity.
36 You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin. I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
37 And you shall observe all my statutes and all my rules and do them. I am the LORD.


Chapter 20

1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Say to the sons of Israel, Any man from the sons of Israel or from the foreigners who sojourn in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Molech shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones.
3 I myself will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has sacrificed one of his children to Molech, made my sanctuary unclean and profaned my holy name.
4 And if the people of the land close their eyes to that man when he sacrifices one of his children to Molech and do not put him to death,
5 then I will set my face against that man and against his clan and will cut them off from among their people, both him and all who follow him in whoring after Molech.

6 If a man turns to mediums and to familiar spirits, whoring after them, I will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people.
7 Consecrate yourselves, therefore, and be holy, for I am the LORD your God.
8 And you shall keep my statutes and do them. I am the LORD who sanctifies you.

9 For anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother—his blood is upon him.

10 If a man commits adultery with the wife of another man, with the wife of his neighbor, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
11 If a man lies with his father’s wife, he has uncovered his father’s nakedness; both of them shall surely be put to death—their blood is upon them.
12 If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death—they have committed perversion; their blood is upon them.
13 If a man lies with a male as one lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination—they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.
14 If a man takes a woman and her mother also, it is depravity. He and they shall be burned with fire, that there may be no depravity among you.

15 If a man lies with an animal, he shall surely be put to death, and you shall kill the animal.
16 If a woman approaches any animal to mate with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal—they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.

17 If a man takes his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother, and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace, and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness—he shall bear his iniquity.
18 If a man lies with a woman during her menstrual impurity and uncovers her nakedness, he has made naked her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood—both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
19 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister or of your father’s sister, for that is to make naked one’s close relative—they shall bear their iniquity.
20 If a man lies with his uncle’s wife, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness—they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
21 If a man takes his brother’s wife, it is impurity—he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.

22 You shall therefore keep all my statutes and all my rules and do them, that the land where I am bringing you to dwell may not vomit you out.
23 And you shall not walk in the customs of the nation that I am driving out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I detested them.
24 But I have said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the LORD your God, who has set you apart from the nations.

25 You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean. You shall not make yourselves detestable by beast or by bird or by anything with which the ground teems, which I have set apart for you to hold unclean.
26 You shall be holy to me, for I the LORD am holy and have set you apart from the nations to be mine.

27 A man or a woman who is a medium or has a familiar spirit shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones—their blood is upon them.


Chapter 21

1 The LORD said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: No man shall make himself unclean for the dead among his people,
2 except for his closest relatives: for his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, and his brother,
3 and for his virgin sister who is near to him, who has had no husband—for her he may make himself unclean.
4 But he shall not make himself unclean as a chief man among his people, to profane himself.

5 They shall not make bald patches on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts in their flesh.
6 They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God. For they offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the food of their God; therefore they shall be holy.

7 They shall not take a woman who is a prostitute or profaned, neither shall they take a woman divorced from her husband, for the priest is holy to his God.
8 You shall sanctify him, for he offers the food of your God. He shall be holy to you, for I the LORD, who sanctify you, am holy.

9 If the daughter of any priest profanes herself by prostitution, she profanes her father—she shall be burned with fire.

10 The priest who is highest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, shall not let his hair hang loose nor tear his garments.
11 He shall not go in to any dead body nor make himself unclean, even for his father or his mother.
12 He shall not go out of the sanctuary, lest he profane the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him. I am the LORD.

13 He shall take a wife in her virginity.
14 A widow or a divorced woman or a woman who has been defiled or a prostitute—these he shall not take. But he shall take as his wife a virgin of his own people,
15 that he may not profane his offspring among his people, for I am the LORD who sanctifies him.

16 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
17 “Speak to Aaron, saying, No man of your offspring throughout their generations who has a blemish shall approach to offer the food of his God.
18 For no man who has a blemish shall draw near, a man blind or lame, or who has a mutilated face or a limb too long,
19 or a man who has a broken foot or a broken hand,
20 or a hunchback or a dwarf, or a man with a defect in his eyes, or an itching disease or scabs or crushed testicles.
21 No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer the LORD’s offerings made by fire. He has a blemish; he shall not come near to offer the food of his God.
22 He may eat the food of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy things,
23 but he shall not go through the veil or approach the altar, because he has a blemish, that he may not profane my sanctuaries. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.”

24 So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel.


Chapter 22

1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they dedicate to me, so that they do not profane my holy name. I am the LORD.
3 Say to them, If any man among all your descendants throughout your generations approaches the holy things that the sons of Israel dedicate to the LORD while he is unclean, that person shall be cut off from before me. I am the LORD.
4 No man of the offspring of Aaron who is a leper or has a discharge may eat of the holy things until he is clean. And if anyone touches anything made unclean by a corpse, or if a man has an emission of semen,
5 or if a man touches any swarming thing by which he may be made unclean, or any man through whom he becomes unclean, whatever his uncleanness may be—
6 the person who touches such shall be unclean until evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has bathed his body in water.
7 When the sun sets, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things, for it is his food.
8 He shall not eat what dies of itself or is torn by beasts, becoming unclean by it. I am the LORD.

9 They shall therefore keep my charge, so that they do not bear sin for it and die thereby if they profane it. I am the LORD who sanctifies them.

10 No layman may eat of a holy thing; a foreigner with a priest or a hired servant shall not eat of a holy thing.
11 But if a priest buys a slave as his property with his money, that one may eat of it, and those born in his house may eat of his food.
12 If a priest’s daughter marries a layman, she shall not eat of the contribution of the holy things.
13 But if the priest’s daughter becomes a widow or is divorced and has no child and returns to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s food. But no layman shall eat of it.

14 If a man eats of a holy thing unintentionally, he shall add a fifth to it and give the holy thing to the priest.
15 They shall not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they contribute to the LORD,
16 and so cause them to bear iniquity and guilt by eating their holy things, for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.

17 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
18 “Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them: When any man of the house of Israel or of the foreigners in Israel presents his offering, whether for any of their votive offerings or for any of their freewill offerings that they present to the LORD as a burnt offering,
19 it must be a male without blemish from the cattle, the sheep, or the goats, to be accepted.
20 You shall not offer anything that has a blemish, for it will not be accepted for you.
21 And when a man offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or from the flock, it must be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish in it.
22 Animals that are blind or broken or maimed or have a discharge or an itching disease or scabs you shall not offer to the LORD or make them an offering by fire on the altar to the LORD.
23 You may present a bull or a lamb that has a part too long or too short for a freewill offering, but for a vow it will not be accepted.
24 Any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut you shall not offer to the LORD. You shall not do it in your land,
25 and you shall not offer as the bread of your God any such animals acquired from a foreigner. Since they have a blemish or they are mutilated, they will not be accepted from you.”

26 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
27 “When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted as an offering made by fire to the LORD.
28 But you shall not slaughter an ox or a sheep and her young on the same day.

29 When you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall present it in an acceptable manner.
30 It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until morning. I am the LORD.

31 So you shall keep my commandments and do them. I am the LORD.
32 And you shall not profane my holy name, so that I may be sanctified among the sons of Israel. I am the LORD who sanctifies you,
33 and brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD.


Chapter 23

1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, These are the appointed times of the LORD, which you shall proclaim as holy convocations. They are my appointed times.

3 Six days you will do your work, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work. It is a Sabbath to the LORD wherever you live.

4 These are the appointed times of the LORD, the holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at their appointed times:
5 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight, is the LORD’s Passover.
6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
7 On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.
8 But for seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.

9 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
10 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land that I give you and reap its harvest, then you shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest.
11 He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD so that you may be accepted. On the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
12 On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD.
13 And its grain offering shall be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, a food offering to the LORD with a pleasing aroma; and its drink offering shall be of wine, a fourth of a hin.
14 And you shall eat neither bread nor roasted grain nor fresh grain until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God. It is a statute forever throughout your generations wherever you live.

15 You shall count seven full weeks from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering.
16 You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath. Then you shall present a new grain offering to the LORD.
17 You shall bring from your dwellings two loaves of bread for a wave offering, made of two tenths of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, and they shall be baked with leaven, as firstfruits to the LORD.
18 And you shall present with the bread seven lambs a year old without blemish, and one bull from the herd and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
19 And you shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old as a sacrifice of peace offerings.
20 The priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
21 And you shall make proclamation on that same day; you shall hold a holy convocation. You shall not do any ordinary work. It is a statute forever wherever you live throughout your generations.

22 And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field to its very edge, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and for the foreigner. I am the LORD your God.

23 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
24 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a solemn rest, a memorial proclaimed with trumpet blast, a holy convocation.
25 You shall not do any ordinary work, and you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD.”

26 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
27 “Now on the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. It shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall humble yourselves and present an offering by fire to the LORD.
28 And you shall not do any work on that same day, for it is a Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God.
29 For any person who does not humble himself on that same day shall be cut off from his people.
30 And any person who does any work on that same day, I will destroy from among his people.
31 You shall not do any work. It is a statute forever throughout your generations wherever you live.
32 It shall be to you a Sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall humble yourselves. On the ninth day of the month beginning at evening, from evening to evening you shall keep your Sabbath.”

33 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
34 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Feast of Booths for seven days to the LORD.
35 On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.
36 For seven days you shall present offerings by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day you shall hold a holy convocation and present an offering by fire to the LORD. It is a solemn assembly; you shall not do any ordinary work.

37 These are the appointed times of the LORD, which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, to present offerings by fire to the LORD—burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its proper day—
38 besides the LORD’s Sabbaths, and besides your gifts and besides all your vow offerings and besides all your freewill offerings that you give to the LORD.

39 On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the LORD for seven days. On the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
40 And you shall take on the first day the fruit of splendid trees, branches of palm trees and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.
41 You shall celebrate it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It is a statute forever throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
42 You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All the native-born in Israel shall dwell in booths,
43 that your generations may know that I made the sons of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.

44 Thus Moses declared to the sons of Israel the appointed times of the LORD.


Chapter 24

1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Command the sons of Israel to bring to you pure oil from beaten olives for the lamp, to keep a lamp burning continually.
3 Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall arrange it continually from evening to morning before the LORD. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
4 He shall arrange the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually.

5 You shall take fine flour and bake twelve loaves from it; two tenths of an ephah shall be in each loaf.
6 And you shall set them in two rows, six in a row, on the table of pure gold before the LORD.
7 You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may go with the bread as a memorial portion, as a food offering to the LORD.
8 Every Sabbath day Aaron shall arrange it before the LORD regularly; it is from the sons of Israel as a covenant forever.
9 And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place, since it is most holy to him from the LORD’s food offerings, a perpetual statute.”

10 Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the sons of Israel. And the son of the Israelite woman and a certain Israelite man fought together in the camp,
11 and the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed. Then they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)
12 And they put him in custody, till the will of the LORD should be declared to them.
13 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
14 “Bring out of the camp the one who cursed, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
15 And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.
16 Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The foreigner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.

17 Whoever takes a human life shall surely be put to death.
18 Whoever takes an animal’s life shall make it good, life for life.
19 If anyone injures his neighbor, as he has done it shall be done to him,
20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; whatever injury he has given a man shall be given to him.
21 Whoever kills an animal shall make it good, and whoever kills a man shall be put to death.
22 You shall have the same rule for the foreigner and for the native, for I am the LORD your God.”

23 So Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought the one who had cursed out of the camp and stoned him with stones. Thus the sons of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.


Chapter 25

1 The LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land that I give you, then the land shall keep a Sabbath to the LORD.
3 For six years you shall sow your field, and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its fruits,
4 but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to the LORD. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
5 You shall not reap what grows of itself in your harvest, nor gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
6 The Sabbath of the land shall provide food for you—for yourself and for your male and female slaves and for your hired worker and the foreigner who lives with you,
7 and for your cattle and for the wild animals that are in your land—all its yield shall be for food.

8 You shall count seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall be forty-nine years.
9 Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land.
10 And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his clan.
11 That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; in it you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of itself nor gather the grapes from the undressed vines.
12 For it is a jubilee. It shall be holy to you. You may eat the produce of the field.

13 In this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his property.
14 And if you make a sale to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one another.
15 You shall pay your neighbor according to the number of years after the jubilee, and he shall sell to you according to the number of years for crops.
16 If the years are many, you shall increase the price, and if the years are few, you shall reduce the price, for it is the number of the crops that he is selling to you.
17 You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God, for I am the LORD your God.

18 Therefore you shall do my statutes and keep my rules and perform them, and then you will dwell in the land securely.
19 The land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and dwell in it securely.
20 And if you say, ‘What shall we eat in the seventh year, if we may not sow or gather our crop?’
21 I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, so that it will produce a crop sufficient for three years.
22 When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating some of the old crop; you shall eat the old until the ninth year, when its crop arrives.

23 The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and foreigners with me.
24 And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.

25 If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold.
26 If a man has no one to redeem it and then himself becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it,
27 let him calculate the years since he sold it and pay back the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and then return to his property.
28 But if he does not have sufficient means to recover it, then what he sold shall remain in the hand of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property.

29 If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, he may redeem it within a year of its sale. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.
30 If it is not redeemed within a full year, then the house in the walled city shall belong in perpetuity to the buyer throughout his generations. It shall not be released in the jubilee.
31 But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them shall be considered as open country. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee.

32 As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem at any time the houses in the cities they possess.
33 And if one of the Levites exercises his right of redemption, then the house that was sold in a city they possess shall be released in the jubilee. For the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel.
34 But the fields of pasture land belonging to their cities may not be sold, for that is their perpetual possession.

35 If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a foreigner, and he shall live with you.
36 Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you.
37 You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.
38 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.

39 If your brother becomes poor beside you and sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave.
40 He shall be with you as a hired worker and as a foreigner. He shall serve with you until the year of jubilee.
41 Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and go back to his own clan and return to the possession of his fathers.
42 For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold as slaves.
43 You shall not rule over him ruthlessly but shall fear your God.

44 As for your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you.
45 You may also buy from among the sons of the foreigners who live among you and from their clans that are with you, who have been born in your land, and they may be your property.
46 You may bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever. You may make slaves of them, but over your brothers the sons of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, ruthlessly.

47 If a stranger or foreigner with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him becomes poor and sells himself to the stranger or foreigner with you or to a member of the stranger’s clan,
48 then after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him,
49 or his uncle or his cousin may redeem him, or a close relative from his clan may redeem him. Or if he grows rich, he may redeem himself.
50 He shall calculate with his buyer from the year when he sold himself to him until the year of jubilee, and the price of his sale shall be in proportion to the number of years. The time he was with his owner shall be rated as the time of a hired worker.
51 If there are still many years left, he shall pay proportionately for his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
52 If there remain but a few years until the year of jubilee, he shall calculate and pay for his redemption in proportion to his years of service.
53 He shall treat him as a worker hired year by year. He shall not rule ruthlessly over him in your sight.

54 And if he is not redeemed by these means, then he and his children with him shall be released in the year of jubilee.
55 For it is to me that the sons of Israel are servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.


Chapter 26

1 You shall not make idols for yourselves, nor shall you set up a carved image or a pillar for yourselves, nor shall you place a figured stone in your land to bow down to it, for I am the LORD your God.
2 You shall keep my Sabbaths and revere my sanctuary: I am the LORD.

3 If you walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them,
4 then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
5 Your threshing shall overtake the vintage, and the vintage shall overtake the sowing. You shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land securely.
6 I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. I will remove harmful beasts from the land, and the sword shall not go through your land.
7 You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
8 Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand, and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
9 I will turn to you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will establish my covenant with you.
10 You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall clear out the old to make way for the new.
11 I will set my dwelling among you, and my soul shall not abhor you.
12 And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people.
13 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. And I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk upright.

14 But if you will not listen to me and will not do all these commandments,
15 if you spurn my statutes, and if your soul abhors my rules so that you will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant,
16 then I will do this to you: I will visit you with panic, with wasting disease and fever that consume the eyes and make the heart ache. And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
17 I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck down before your enemies. Those who hate you shall rule over you, and you shall flee when none pursues you.

18 And if in spite of this you will not listen to me, then I will discipline you again sevenfold for your sins,
19 and I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your heavens like iron and your earth like bronze.
20 And your strength shall be spent in vain, for your land shall not yield its increase, and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit.

21 Then if you walk contrary to me and will not listen to me, I will continue striking you, sevenfold for your sins.
22 And I will let loose the wild beasts against you, which shall bereave you of your children and destroy your livestock and make you few in number, so that your roads shall be deserted.

23 And if by this discipline you are not turned to me but walk contrary to me,
24 then I also will walk contrary to you, and I myself will strike you sevenfold for your sins.
25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute vengeance for the covenant. And if you gather within your cities, I will send pestilence among you, and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
26 When I break your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven and shall dole out your bread again by weight, and you shall eat and not be satisfied.

27 But if in spite of this you will not listen to me, but walk contrary to me,
28 then I will walk contrary to you in fury, and I myself will discipline you sevenfold for your sins.
29 You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters.
30 And I will destroy your high places and cut down your incense altars and cast your dead bodies upon the dead bodies of your idols, and my soul will abhor you.
31 And I will lay your cities waste and will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your pleasing aromas.
32 And I myself will devastate the land, so that your enemies who settle in it shall be appalled at it.
33 And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword after you. Your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.

34 Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate, while you are in your enemies’ land; then the land shall rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.
35 As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, the rest that it did not have on your Sabbaths when you were dwelling in it.
36 And as for those of you who are left, I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall when none pursues.
37 They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though none pursues. And you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
38 And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
39 And those of you who are left shall rot away in your enemies’ lands because of their iniquity, and also because of the iniquities of their fathers they shall rot away like them.

40 But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers in their treachery that they committed against me, and also in walking contrary to me,
41 so that I walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies—if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled and they make amends for their iniquity,
42 then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and I will remember my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.
43 But the land shall be abandoned by them and enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them, and they shall make amends for their iniquity, because they spurned my rules and their soul abhorred my statutes.
44 Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not spurn them, neither will I abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and break my covenant with them, for I am the LORD their God.
45 But, for their sake, I will remember the covenant with their forefathers, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.

46 These are the statutes and rules and laws that the LORD made between himself and the sons of Israel through Moses on Mount Sinai.


Chapter 27

1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When a man makes a special vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your valuation.

3 If your valuation is for a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
4 If it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.
5 And if from five years old up to twenty years old, your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels.
6 And if from a month old up to five years old, your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.
7 And if from sixty years old and upward, if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels.
8 But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; the priest shall value him according to what the man who vowed can afford.

9 And if it is a beast of which men bring an offering to the LORD, all that a man gives to the LORD from it shall be holy.
10 He shall not exchange it or substitute it, good for bad or bad for good; and if he does substitute beast for beast, then both it and its substitute shall be holy.
11 And if it is any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering to the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest,
12 and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be.
13 But if he ever wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth to its valuation.

14 When a man dedicates his house as holy to the LORD, the priest shall value it, whether good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand.
15 And if the one who dedicates it wishes to redeem his house, then he shall add a fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his.

16 And if a man dedicates to the LORD part of the field of his possession, your valuation shall be in proportion to its seed: a homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
17 If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee, it shall stand at your full valuation.
18 But if he dedicates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the money according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and a deduction shall be made from your valuation.
19 And if he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be assured to him.
20 But if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore.
21 But the field, when it is released in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, like a devoted field; it shall be the priest’s possession.

22 And if he dedicates to the LORD a field that he has bought, which is not part of the field of his possession,
23 then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation up to the year of jubilee, and the man shall give your valuation on that day as a holy thing to the LORD.
24 In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought, to whom the possession of the land belongs.
25 All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.

26 But a firstborn of animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the LORD, no man may dedicate; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD’s.
27 But if it is of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it at your valuation and add a fifth to it; but if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at your valuation.

28 But nothing that a man devotes to the LORD, of anything that he has, whether man or beast or his inherited field, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.
29 No one devoted, who is devoted for destruction from mankind, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.

30 Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the LORD’s; it is holy to the LORD.
31 If a man wishes to redeem any of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it.
32 And every tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman’s staff, shall be holy to the LORD.
33 One shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he exchange it; and if he does exchange it, then both it and the substitute shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

34 These are the commandments that the LORD commanded Moses for the sons of Israel on Mount Sinai.

﻿Numbers


Chapter 1


1 The LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
2 “Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, every male, head by head,
3 from twenty years old and upward, everyone in Israel who is able to go out to war. You and Aaron shall number them by their companies.
4 And with you there shall be a man from each tribe, each man the head of his fathers’ house.
5 And these are the names of the men who shall assist you: from Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur;
6 from Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;
7 from Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab;
8 from Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar;
9 from Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon;
10 from the sons of Joseph, from Ephraim, Elishama the son of Ammihud, and from Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur;
11 from Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideoni;
12 from Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai;
13 from Asher, Pagiel the son of Ochran;
14 from Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel;
15 from Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan.
16 These were the ones called from the congregation, the chiefs of their ancestral tribes, the heads of the clans of Israel.


17 So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name,
18 and on the first day of the second month, they assembled the whole congregation together. They registered themselves by clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, head by head,
19 as the LORD commanded Moses. So he counted them in the wilderness of Sinai.


20 The sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
21 those listed of the tribe of Reuben were forty-six thousand five hundred.


22 Of the sons of Simeon, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, those who were counted, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
23 those listed of the tribe of Simeon were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.


24 Of the sons of Gad, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
25 those listed of the tribe of Gad were forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.


26 Of the sons of Judah, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
27 those listed of the tribe of Judah were seventy-four thousand six hundred.


28 Of the sons of Issachar, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
29 those listed of the tribe of Issachar were fifty-four thousand four hundred.


30 Of the sons of Zebulun, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
31 those listed of the tribe of Zebulun were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.


32 Of the sons of Joseph, namely of the sons of Ephraim, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
33 those listed of the tribe of Ephraim were forty thousand five hundred.


34 Of the sons of Manasseh, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
35 those listed of the tribe of Manasseh were thirty-two thousand two hundred.


36 Of the sons of Benjamin, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
37 those listed of the tribe of Benjamin were thirty-five thousand four hundred.


38 Of the sons of Dan, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
39 those listed of the tribe of Dan were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.


40 Of the sons of Asher, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
41 those listed of the tribe of Asher were forty-one thousand five hundred.


42 Of the sons of Naphtali, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
43 those listed of the tribe of Naphtali were fifty-three thousand four hundred.


44 These are those who were listed, whom Moses and Aaron listed with the twelve chiefs of Israel, each representing his fathers’ house.
45 So all those listed of the sons of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go out to war in Israel—
46 all those who were listed were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.


47 But the Levites, according to the tribe of their fathers, were not listed among them.
48 For the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
49 “Only the tribe of Levi you shall not list, and you shall not take their census among the sons of Israel.
50 But appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it and camp around the tabernacle.
51 When the tabernacle is set out, the Levites shall take it down, and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. But any outsider who comes near shall be put to death.
52 The sons of Israel shall pitch their tents, each man by his own camp and each man by his own standard, according to their hosts.
53 But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the sons of Israel. And the Levites shall keep guard over the tabernacle of the testimony.”
54 Thus the sons of Israel did; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they did.




Chapter 2


1 The LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
2 “The sons of Israel shall camp, each by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers’ houses. They shall camp facing the tent of meeting on every side.


3 Those who camp on the east side, toward the sunrise, shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah by their companies, and the leader of the sons of Judah shall be Nahshon the son of Amminadab,
4 and his company, as those who were listed, were seventy-four thousand six hundred.
5 Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar, and the leader of the sons of Issachar shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar,
6 and his company, as those who were listed, were fifty-four thousand four hundred.
7 Then the tribe of Zebulun, and the leader of the sons of Zebulun shall be Eliab the son of Helon,
8 and his company, as those who were listed, were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
9 All those listed of the camp of Judah, by their companies, were one hundred eighty-six thousand four hundred. They shall set out first on the march.


10 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben by their companies, and the leader of the sons of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur,
11 and his company, as those who were listed, were forty-six thousand five hundred.
12 And those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon, and the leader of the sons of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai,
13 and his company, as those who were listed, were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
14 Then the tribe of Gad, and the leader of the sons of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel,
15 and his company, as those who were listed, were forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.
16 All those listed of the camp of Reuben, by their companies, were one hundred fifty-one thousand four hundred fifty. They shall set out second.


17 Then the tent of meeting shall set out, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps. As they camp, so shall they set out, each in position, standard by standard.


18 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim by their companies, and the leader of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud,
19 and his company, as those who were listed, were forty thousand five hundred.
20 And next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh, and the leader of the sons of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur,
21 and his company, as those who were listed, were thirty-two thousand two hundred.
22 Then the tribe of Benjamin, and the leader of the sons of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni,
23 and his company, as those who were listed, were thirty-five thousand four hundred.
24 All those listed of the camp of Ephraim, by their companies, were one hundred eight thousand one hundred. They shall set out third on the march.


25 On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan by their companies, and the leader of the sons of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai,
26 and his company, as those who were listed, were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
27 And those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher, and the leader of the sons of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of Ochran,
28 and his company, as those who were listed, were forty-one thousand five hundred.
29 Then the tribe of Naphtali, and the leader of the sons of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan,
30 and his company, as those who were listed, were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
31 All those listed of the camp of Dan were one hundred fifty-seven thousand six hundred. They shall set out last, standard by standard.


32 These are those who were listed of the sons of Israel by their fathers’ houses. All those listed of the camps by their companies were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.
33 But the Levites were not listed among the sons of Israel, as the LORD commanded Moses.
34 Thus the sons of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses. So they camped by their standards, and so they set out, each one by his clan, according to his fathers’ house.




Chapter 3


1 These are the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
2 These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
3 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he consecrated to serve as priests.


4 But Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no sons. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests under the authority of Aaron, their father.


5 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
6 “Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him.
7 They shall serve him, and serve the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to perform the service of the tabernacle.
8 And they shall take care of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting and attend to the duties for the sons of Israel, to perform the service of the tabernacle.
9 You shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given to him from among the sons of Israel.
10 You shall appoint Aaron and his sons, that they may keep their priesthood; but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death.”


11 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
12 “Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of every firstborn, the first to open the womb among the sons of Israel. So the Levites shall be mine,
13 for all the firstborn are mine. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated to myself all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They shall be mine. I am the LORD.”


14 Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
15 “Count the sons of Levi by their fathers’ households, by their clans; every male from one month old and upward you shall count.”
16 So Moses counted them according to the word of the LORD, just as he had been commanded.


17 These were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
18 These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their clans: Libni and Shimei.
19 The sons of Kohath by their clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
20 The sons of Merari by their clans: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites according to their fathers’ households.


21 Of Gershon were the clan of the Libnites and the clan of the Shimeites; these were the clans of the Gershonites.
22 Their numbered males, from one month old and upward, numbered seven thousand five hundred.
23 The clans of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle to the west,
24 and the leader of the fathers’ household of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael.
25 The duties of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting included the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting,
26 the hangings of the court, the screen for the doorway of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and its ropes, and all the service concerning these items.


27 Of Kohath were the clan of the Amramites, the clan of the Izharites, the clan of the Hebronites, and the clan of the Uzzielites; these were the clans of the Kohathites.
28 The number of all the males from one month old and upward was eight thousand six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.
29 The clans of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle,
30 and the leader of the fathers’ household of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
31 Their duties included the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the utensils of the sanctuary with which they minister, the screen, and all the service concerning these items.
32 Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was the chief over the leaders of the Levites and had the oversight of those performing the duties of the sanctuary.


33 Of Merari were the clan of the Mahlites and the clan of the Mushites; these were the clans of Merari.
34 Their numbered males from one month old and upward were six thousand two hundred.
35 The leader of the fathers’ household of the clans of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
36 The appointed duties of the sons of Merari included the frames of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its bases, all its equipment, and the service concerning these items,
37 and the pillars around the court with their bases and their pegs and their cords.


38 Now those who were to camp before the tabernacle to the east, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons, performing the duties of the sanctuary for the obligation of the sons of Israel; but the outsider who came near was to be put to death.


39 All the numbered Levites, whom Moses and Aaron counted at the command of the LORD by their clans, every male from one month old and upward, were twenty-two thousand.


40 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Count every firstborn male of the sons of Israel from one month old and upward, and make a list of their names.
41 You shall take the Levites for me—I am the LORD—instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the sons of Israel.”


42 So Moses counted all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded him,
43 and all the firstborn males by the number of names from one month old and upward, for their numbered men, were twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three.


44 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
45 “Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle. So the Levites shall be mine. I am the LORD.
46 And as the redemption price for the two hundred seventy-three of the firstborn of the sons of Israel who are beyond the number of the Levites,
47 you shall take five shekels per person; you shall take them according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs),
48 and give the money, the redemption price of those who are in excess among them, to Aaron and to his sons.”


49 So Moses took the redemption money from those who were in excess beyond those redeemed by the Levites.
50 He took the money from the firstborn of the sons of Israel, one thousand three hundred sixty-five shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary.
51 Then Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.




Chapter 4


1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
2 “Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their clans, by their fathers’ households,
3 from thirty years old and upward, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to perform the work in the tent of meeting.
4 This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, regarding the most holy things.


5 When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down the veil of the screen and cover the ark of the testimony with it.
6 They shall place over it a covering of fine leather, and spread over that a cloth of pure blue, and insert its poles.
7 Over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall spread a blue cloth and put on it the dishes and the pans and the bowls and the jars for the drink offering, and the continual bread shall be on it.
8 They shall spread over them a scarlet cloth, and cover the same with a covering of fine leather, and insert its poles.
9 Then they shall take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for the light, along with its lamps, its tongs, its trays, and all its oil vessels, by which they serve it.
10 And they shall put it and all its utensils into a covering of fine leather and put it on the carrying frame.
11 Over the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth and cover it with a covering of fine leather, and insert its poles.
12 Then they shall take all the utensils of the service with which they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth and cover them with a covering of fine leather, and put them on the carrying frame.
13 They shall also clean the ashes from the altar and spread a purple cloth over it.
14 They shall put on it all its utensils by which they minister there, the fire pans, the forks, the shovels, and the basins, all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread over it a covering of fine leather and insert its poles.


15 When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy items and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is to set out, then the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them, so that they will not touch the holy objects and die. These are the duties of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting.
16 But the oversight of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be over the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the continual grain offering, and the anointing oil—the oversight of all the tabernacle and all that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings.”


17 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
18 “Do not let the tribe of the families of the Kohathites be cut off from among the Levites.
19 But do this for them so that they will live and not die when they approach the most holy items: Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign each of them to his service and to his load.
20 But they shall not go in to see the holy items even for a moment, or they will die.”


21 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
22 “Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers’ households, by their clans.
23 From thirty years old and upward to fifty years old you shall number them, all who come to serve to do the work in the tent of meeting.
24 This is the service of the clans of the Gershonites, in serving and in carrying:
25 they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting, its covering and the covering of fine leather that is on top of it, and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting,
26 and the hangings of the courtyard, and the screen for the entrance of the gate of the courtyard which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their ropes and all the equipment for their service; and all that is to be done, they shall perform.
27 At the command of Aaron and his sons all the service of the sons of the Gershonites shall be in regard to all their duties and in regard to all their carrying; and you shall assign their duties to them as their responsibility.
28 This is the service of the clans of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting; and their duties shall be under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.


29 As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their clans, by their fathers’ households;
30 from thirty years old and upward to fifty years old you shall number them, everyone who enters the service to do the work of the tent of meeting.
31 Now this is the duty of their loads, according to all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle and its crossbars and its pillars and its bases,
32 and the pillars around the courtyard with their bases and their pegs and their ropes, with all their equipment and with all their service; and you shall assign each man by name the items he is to carry.
33 This is the service of the clans of the sons of Merari, according to all their service in the tent of meeting, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.”


34 So Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the congregation counted the sons of the Kohathites by their clans and by their fathers’ households,
35 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for the work in the tent of meeting.
36 Their numbered men by their clans were two thousand seven hundred fifty.
37 These were the men counted in the clans of the Kohathites, all who served in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the command of the LORD through Moses.


38 And the numbered men of the sons of Gershon by their clans and by their fathers’ households,
39 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for the work in the tent of meeting—
40 their numbered men by their clans and by their fathers’ households were two thousand six hundred thirty.
41 These were the men counted by clans of the sons of Gershon, everyone who served in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the command of the LORD.


42 And the numbered men of the clans of the sons of Merari by their clans and by their fathers’ households,
43 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for the work in the tent of meeting—
44 their numbered men by their clans were three thousand two hundred.
45 These were the men counted by clans of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the command of the LORD through Moses.


46 All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel counted by their clans and by their fathers’ households,
47 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who could enter to do the work of service and the work of carrying in the tent of meeting—
48 their numbered men were eight thousand five hundred eighty.
49 According to the command of the LORD through Moses, they were counted, each man by his service or by his carrying; so these were his numbered men, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.




Chapter 5


1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Command the sons of Israel that they send away from the camp every leper and everyone with a discharge and everyone who is unclean because of contact with a corpse.
3 You shall send both male and female away; you shall send them outside the camp so that they do not defile their camp, where I dwell in their midst.”
4 So the sons of Israel did so and sent them outside the camp; just as the LORD had spoken to Moses, so the sons of Israel did.


5 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
6 “Speak to the sons of Israel: When a man or a woman commits any of the sins of mankind by acting unfaithfully against the LORD, and that person is guilty,
7 then he shall confess his sin which he has committed, and he shall make restitution in full for his wrong and add a fifth, and give it to the person whom he wronged.
8 But if the man has no redeemer to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution which is made shall go to the LORD for the priest, besides the ram of atonement by which atonement is made for him.
9 Also every contribution pertaining to all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, which they offer to the priest, shall be his.
10 Every man’s holy gifts shall be his; whatever any man gives to the priest, it becomes his.”


11 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
12 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘If any man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him,
13 and a man has sexual relations with her, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and she is undetected, although she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act,
14 and a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has defiled herself, or a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has not defiled herself,
15 then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring as her offering for her one-tenth of an ephah of barley flour; he shall not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of memorial, a reminder of wrongdoing.


16 Then the priest shall bring her forward and have her stand before the LORD,
17 and the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel; and he shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.
18 Then the priest shall have the woman stand before the LORD and let the hair of the woman’s head go loose, and place the grain offering of memorial in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy; and the water of bitterness that brings a curse shall be in the hand of the priest.
19 And the priest shall have her take an oath and shall say to the woman, ‘If no man has lain with you, and if you have not been unfaithful while under your husband’s authority, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings a curse.
20 But if you have gone astray, though under your husband’s authority, and if you have defiled yourself and a man other than your husband has had intercourse with you’—
21 then the priest shall have the woman swear with the oath of the curse, and the priest shall say to the woman—‘may the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people by the LORD’S making your thigh waste away and your abdomen swell;
22 and this water that brings a curse will go into your stomach and make your abdomen swell and your thigh waste away.’ And the woman shall say, ‘Amen. Amen.’


23 Then the priest shall write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the water of bitterness.
24 And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings a curse, so that the water which brings a curse will go into her and cause bitterness.
25 And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman’s hand, and he shall wave the grain offering before the LORD and bring it to the altar;
26 and the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering as its memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar, and afterward he shall make the woman drink the water.
27 When he has made her drink the water, then it will come about that, if she has defiled herself and has committed an act of unfaithfulness against her husband, the water which brings a curse will go into her and cause bitterness, and her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away, and the woman will become a curse among her people.
28 But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will be immune and will be able to conceive children.


29 This is the law of jealousy: when a wife, though under her husband’s authority, goes astray and defiles herself,
30 or when a spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife, he shall then have the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest shall carry out all this law for her.
31 Moreover, the man will be free of guilt, but that woman shall bear her guilt.




Chapter 6


1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When a man or a woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to dedicate himself to the LORD,
3 he shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar, whether made from wine or strong drink, nor shall he drink any grape juice nor eat fresh or dried grapes.
4 All the days of his dedication he shall not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, from the seeds, to the skin.


5 All the days of his vow of dedication, no razor shall pass over his head. Until the days are fulfilled for which he dedicated himself to the LORD, he shall be holy; he shall let the locks of hair on his head grow long.
6 All the days of his dedication to the LORD he shall not go near a dead person.
7 He shall not defile himself even for his father or for his mother or for his brother or sister when they die, because his dedication to God is on his head.
8 All the days of his dedication he is holy to the LORD.


9 But if someone dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his dedicated head, then he shall shave his head on the day he becomes clean; on the seventh day he shall shave it.
10 Then on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
11 The priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering and make atonement for him concerning his sin because of the dead person. And he shall consecrate his head on that same day.
12 He shall dedicate to the LORD the days of his dedication and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering. But the former days will be void because his dedication was defiled.


13 Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his dedication are fulfilled: he shall bring his offering to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
14 He shall offer his gift to the LORD: one unblemished male lamb a year old as a burnt offering, and one unblemished ewe lamb a year old as a sin offering, and one unblemished ram as a peace offering,
15 and a basket of unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, along with their grain offering and their drink offerings.
16 Then the priest shall present them before the LORD and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.
17 He shall also offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall likewise offer its grain offering and its drink offering.
18 The Nazirite shall then shave his dedicated head at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and take the hair of his dedicated head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.
19 The priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened loaf from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his dedicated hair.
20 Then the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before the LORD; it is holy for the priest, together with the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution. Afterward the Nazirite may drink wine.


21 This is the law of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD according to his dedication, in addition to what he can afford. In accordance with the vow which he takes, so he shall do according to the law of his dedication.”


22 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
23 “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is how you shall bless the sons of Israel. You shall say to them:


24 The LORD bless you and keep you;
25 The LORD make His face shine on you and be gracious to you;
26 The LORD lift up His face to you and give you peace.’


27 So they shall invoke My name on the sons of Israel, and I will bless them.”




Chapter 7


1 On the day Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it with all its furnishings, as well as the altar and all its utensils; he anointed and consecrated them.
2 Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their ancestral houses, who were the tribal chiefs over those who had been counted, brought offerings.
3 They brought their offerings before the LORD: six covered carts and twelve oxen—one cart for every two leaders and one ox for each—and they presented them before the tabernacle.
4 Then the LORD said to Moses,
5 “Accept these from them for use in the service of the tent of meeting, and give them to the Levites, each according to the service to which he is assigned.”
6 So Moses took the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
7 He gave two carts and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their service.
8 And he gave four carts and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
9 But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because their service was to carry on the shoulder the holy things for which they were responsible.


10 The leaders brought their dedication offerings for the altar when it was anointed, and the leaders presented their offerings before the altar.
11 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Let them present their offerings, one leader per day, for the dedication of the altar.”

Chapter 8


1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Speak to Aaron and say to him: ‘When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.’”
3 And Aaron did so; he set up the lamps to face forward on the lampstand, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
4 Now this was the workmanship of the lampstand: hammered work of gold. From its base to its blossoms it was hammered work; Moses made the lampstand according to the pattern that the LORD had shown him.


5 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
6 “Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and purify them.
7 And this is what you shall do to them, to purify them: sprinkle the water of purification upon them, and let them shave their whole body with a razor and wash their clothes, and so purify themselves.
8 Then they shall take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take a second young bull for a sin offering.
9 You shall bring the Levites before the Tent of Meeting, and you shall gather the whole congregation of the sons of Israel.
10 You shall bring the Levites before the LORD, and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites.
11 Then Aaron shall present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, so that they may perform the service of the LORD.
12 The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites.
13 You shall set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons and present them as a wave offering to the LORD.


14 Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.
15 After that the Levites shall go in to serve at the Tent of Meeting, once you have purified them and presented them as a wave offering,
16 for they are wholly given to me from among the sons of Israel. I have taken them for myself instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel.
17 For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is mine, both man and beast. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated them to myself.
18 But I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel.
19 I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, to perform the service of the sons of Israel at the Tent of Meeting and to make atonement for the sons of Israel, so that there will be no plague among the sons of Israel when the sons of Israel come near the sanctuary.”


20 Thus Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel did to the Levites. According to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them.
21 The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes, and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD, and Aaron made atonement for them to purify them.
22 After that the Levites went in to perform their service at the Tent of Meeting before Aaron and before his sons. Just as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.


23 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
24 “This is what applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall come to perform service in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
25 But from the age of fifty years they shall retire from the service and shall not work any longer.
26 They may assist their brothers in the Tent of Meeting by keeping guard, but they themselves shall not do the work. Thus you shall deal with the Levites in regard to their duties.”




Chapter 9


1 The LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
2 “Let the sons of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time.
3 On the fourteenth day of this month at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances you shall keep it.”
4 So Moses spoke to the sons of Israel to keep the Passover.
5 And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at twilight in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did.
6 But there were certain men who were unclean because of a dead body, and they could not keep the Passover on that day. So they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day,
7 and those men said to him, “We are unclean because of a dead body. Why are we kept from presenting the offering of the LORD at its appointed time among the sons of Israel?”
8 And Moses said to them, “Wait, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.”


9 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
10 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying: ‘If any man of you or of your generations becomes unclean because of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he may still keep the Passover to the LORD.
11 In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight, they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
12 They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break a bone of it. They shall keep it according to all the statutes of the Passover.
13 But the man who is clean and is not on a journey and yet fails to keep the Passover, that person shall be cut off from his people, because he did not present the offering of the LORD at its appointed time. That man shall bear his sin.
14 If a foreigner dwells with you and keeps the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its ordinance, he may do so. You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner and for the native of the land.’”


15 On the day the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony. And at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning.
16 So it was always: the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night.


17 Whenever the cloud was lifted from over the tent, after that the sons of Israel would set out, and in the place where the cloud settled, there the sons of Israel would camp.
18 At the command of the LORD the sons of Israel set out, and at the command of the LORD they camped. As long as the cloud dwelled over the tabernacle, they remained encamped.
19 Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the sons of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and did not set out.


20 Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days. At the command of the LORD they would remain encamped, and at the command of the LORD they would set out.
21 Sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, and when the cloud was lifted in the morning, they would set out; or if it remained for a day and a night, when the cloud was lifted they would set out.
22 Whether it was two days or a month or a year that the cloud remained over the tabernacle, staying above it, the sons of Israel remained encamped and did not set out. But when it was lifted, they set out.
23 At the command of the LORD they encamped, and at the command of the LORD they set out. They kept the charge of the LORD, at the command of the LORD through Moses.




Chapter 10


1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Make for yourself two silver trumpets. Of hammered work you shall make them, and they shall be used for summoning the congregation and for setting the camps in motion.
3 When both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
4 But if only one is blown, then the leaders, the heads of the tribes of Israel, shall assemble before you.
5 When you blow an alarm, the camps that are on the east side shall set out.
6 And when you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out.
7 But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
8 The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. And they shall be for you as a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
9 When you go to war in your land against the adversary who attacks you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, so that you may be remembered before the LORD your God and be saved from your enemies.
10 Also on the day of your gladness and on your appointed feasts and on the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; they shall serve as a reminder for you before your God. I am the LORD your God.”


11 In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony.
12 And the sons of Israel set out by stages from the wilderness of Sinai. Then the cloud settled in the wilderness of Paran.
13 So they set out for the first time at the command of the LORD by Moses.
14 The standard of the camp of the sons of Judah set out first by their divisions, and over their host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
15 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.
16 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.


17 Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out, carrying the tabernacle.
18 Then the standard of the camp of Reuben set out by their divisions, and over their host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
19 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
20 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.


21 Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things, and the tabernacle was to be set up before their arrival.
22 Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set out by their divisions, and over their host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
23 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
24 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.


25 Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan set out, acting as the rear guard for all the camps by their divisions, and over their host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
26 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.
27 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
28 This was the order of march of the sons of Israel by their divisions as they set out.


29 And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will do good to you, for the LORD has promised good concerning Israel.”
30 But he said to him, “I will not go. I will go to my own land and to my kindred.”
31 Then he said, “Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us.
32 And if you go with us—whatever good the LORD does for us—we will do the same for you.”


33 So they set out from the mount of the LORD three days’ journey, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD going before them for the three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.
34 And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day, when they set out from the camp.


35 And whenever the ark set out, Moses said,
“Arise, O LORD, and let Your enemies be scattered,
and let those who hate You flee before You.”


36 And when it came to rest, he said,
“Return, O LORD, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel.”




Chapter 11


1 Now the people began to complain in the hearing of the LORD about their hardships, and the LORD heard. His anger was kindled, and the fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed some on the outskirts of the camp.
2 Then the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down.
3 So that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them.


4 The mixed multitude who were among them craved intensely, and the sons of Israel also wept again and said, “Who will give us meat to eat?
5 We remember the fish that we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.
6 But now our soul is dried up; there is nothing at all except this manna to look at.”


7 Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium.
8 The people went about and gathered it and ground it between millstones or beat it in a mortar and boiled it in pots and made it into cakes, and its taste was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.


9 When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall upon it.
10 Then Moses heard the people moaning throughout their clans, each man at the entrance of his tent. And the anger of the LORD was burned, and Moses was displeased.
11 Moses said to the LORD, “Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You lay the burden of all these people on me?
12 Did I conceive all this people? Did I give birth to them, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries a nursing child,’ to the land which You swore to their fathers?


13 Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they groan before me, saying, ‘Give us meat to eat!’
14 I am not able to support all these people alone, because it is too difficult for me.
15 If You treat me this way, please kill me now—if I have found favor in Your sight—so that I do not see my wretchedness.”


16 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel, whom you know to be leaders of the people and officers over them. Bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them stand there with you.
17 Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the Spirit who is upon you and put Him upon them. Then they shall support the people with you, so that you do not struggle alone.
18 Say to the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you will eat meat; for the LORD has heard your complaints, when you were saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For it was better for us in Egypt.” Therefore the LORD will give you meat to eat.


19 But you will eat not it for only one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,
20 but for a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before Him, saying, “Why did we come out of Egypt?”’”
21 But Moses said, “There are six hundred thousand people on foot here with me, yet You have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat for a whole month.’
22 Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered to provide enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together to provide enough for them?”
23 And the LORD said to Moses, “Is the LORD’s hand shortened? Now you shall see if My word comes to pass for you.”


24 So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. And he gathered seventy men from the elders of the people and stationed them around the tent.
25 Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him. And He took of the Spirit who was upon him and put Him upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did not continue doing it.


26 But two men had remained in the camp; the name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested on them (they were among those written down but had not gone out to the tent), and they prophesied in the camp.
27 Then a young man ran and told Moses, saying, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”
28 Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from his youth, answered and said, “My lord Moses, restrain them!”
29 But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? I would be glad if all the LORD’s people were prophets, that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!”
30 Then Moses returned to the camp, both he and the elders of Israel.


31 Then a wind from the LORD went out and brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on one side and a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp, about two cubits deep on the surface of the ground.
32 And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day and gathered the quail (the one who gathered least, gathered ten homers), and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.
33 While the meat was still between their teeth, before they had chewed it, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very great plague.
34 So that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the men who had craved.
35 From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they stayed at Hazeroth.




Chapter 12


1 Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had taken, for he had a Cushite wife.
2 They said, “Has the LORD really spoken only through Moses? Hasn’t He also spoken through us?” And the LORD heard it.


3 Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.


4 And suddenly the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron and to Miriam, “Come out, the three of you, to the tent of meeting.” So the three of them went out.
5 Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward.
6 And He said, “Hear My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, make Myself known to him in a vision; I speak to him in a dream.
7 Not so with My servant Moses; he is faithful in all My house.
8 With him I speak face to face, clearly, and not in riddles, and he sees the form of the LORD. Why, then, were you not afraid to speak against My servant, Moses?”


9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and He departed.
10 When the cloud lifted from over the tent, they saw that  Miriam was leprous, like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and she was leprous.
11 Then Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, please do not hold this sin against us in which we have acted foolishly and have sinned.
12 Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”


13 So Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, “O God, please heal her, please!”
14 But the LORD said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut outside the camp for seven days, and afterward she may be brought in again.”
15 So Miriam was shut outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not journey until Miriam was brought in again.


16 After that the people set out from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.




Chapter 13


1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel. You shall send one man from each tribe of his fathers, each one a chief among them.”
3 So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran at the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the sons of Israel.


4 These were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
5 from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
6 from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
7 from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;
8 from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;
9 from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
10 from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
11 from the tribe of Joseph, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;
12 from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
13 from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
14 from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
15 from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
16 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. But Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.


17 Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them, “Go through the Negev and into the hill country,
18 and see what the land is like, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, few or many,
19 and whether the land in which they dwell is good or bad, and whether the cities they live in are like camps or have fortifications,
20 and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. Be courageous, and take some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.


21 So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, at Lebo-hamath.
22 They went up into the Negev and came to Hebron. Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)


23 Then they came to the Valley of Eshcol and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two men, with some pomegranates and figs.
24 That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster that the sons of Israel cut down from there.


25 At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.
26 They came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh, and brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
27 They told him and said, “We came into the land where you sent us, and it certainly does flow with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
28 Nevertheless, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the descendants of Anak there.
29 Amalek is living in the land of the Negev, and the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country. The Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the Jordan.”


30 Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, “Let us go up at once and take possession of it, for we are certainly able to overcome it.”
31 But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than us.”
32 So they gave a bad report of the land that they had spied out to the sons of Israel, saying, “The land through which we have gone to spy it out is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great stature.
33 There we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are of the Nephilim), and we seemed like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we seemed in their sight.




Chapter 14


1 Then all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried out, and the people wept that night.
2 All the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, “Oh, that we would have died in the land of Egypt, or that we would have died in this wilderness!
3 Why is the LORD bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to return to Egypt?”
4 So they said to one another, “Let’s appoint a leader and return to Egypt.”


5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the entire assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.
6 And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes,
7 and they said to the entire congregation of the sons of Israel, “The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land.
8 If the LORD delights in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us—a land which flows with milk and honey.
9 Only do not rebel against the LORD, and do not fear the people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their protection has been removed from them, and the LORD is with us. Do not fear them.”
10 But all the congregation said, stone them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared in the tent of meeting, to all the sons of Israel.


11 The LORD said to Moses, “How long will this people spurn Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the signs that I have performed among them?
12 I will strike them with a plague and destroy them, and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they.”


13 But Moses said to the LORD, “Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for You brought up this people by Your power from among them,
14 and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, O LORD, are in the midst of this people—for You, O LORD, are seen face to face, and Your cloud stands over them, and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
15 Now if You put this people to death all at once, then the nations who have heard of Your fame will say,
16 ‘The LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which He had promised them by oath, so He has slaughtered them in the wilderness.’
17 But now, please let the power of the Lord be great, just as You have spoken, saying,
18 ‘The LORD is slow to anger and abundant in loyal love, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation.’
19 Please pardon the guilt of this people according to the greatness of Your loyal love, just as You also have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.”


20 So the LORD said, “I have pardoned them according to your word.
21 But as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of the LORD.
22 Therefore, all the men who have seen My glory and My miracles which I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tested Me these ten times and have not listened to My voice,
23 they shall by no means see the land which I swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who spurned Me see it.
24 But My servant Caleb, because he had a different spirit and has followed Me fully, I will bring him into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall take possession of it.
25 Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys. Tomorrow, turn around and set out for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.”


26 The LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
27 “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who are grumbling against Me? I have heard the complaints of the sons of Israel, which they are raising against Me.
28 Say to them, ‘As I live, declares the LORD, just as you have spoken in My hearing, so I will do to you:
29 your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness, all your adult men, twenty years old and older, who have grumbled against Me.
30 You shall by no means come into the land in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.
31 But your little ones, whom you said would become plunder—I will bring them in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.
32 But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
33 Your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and they shall bear your unfaithfulness, until your corpses are decaying in the wilderness.
34 According to the number of the days you spied out the land, forty days, for each day you shall bear your iniquity for a year, namely forty years, and you shall know what it means to oppose me.
35 I, the LORD, have spoken; I will certainly do this to the entire evil congregation gathered together against Me. They shall come to an end, and they shall die in this wilderness.’”


36 As for the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land and who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing a bad report of the land,
37 those men who brought the bad report of the land died by a plague before the LORD.
38 But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.


39 When Moses spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people mourned greatly.
40 In the morning they rose early and went up to the ridge of the hill country, saying, “We are here at the place which the LORD has promised. And though we have indeed sinned, we will still enter here.”
41 But Moses said, “Why are you transgressing the commandment of the LORD? It will not succeed.
42 Do not go up, or you will be struck down before your enemies, for the LORD is not among you.
43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will be there before you, and you will fall by the sword, because you have turned away from the LORD, and the LORD will not be with you.”
44 Then they went up heedlessly to the ridge of the hill country. But neither the ark of the covenant of the LORD nor Moses departed from the camp.
45 Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down, struck them, and beat them down as far as Hormah.




Chapter 15


1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come into the land where you are to live, which I am giving to you,
3 and you offer to the LORD a food offering from the herd or the flock, either as a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering or in your appointed times, to make a pleasing aroma to the LORD,
4 then the one who brings his offering shall present to the LORD a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil,
5 and wine for the drink offering, a fourth of a hin you shall prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
6 Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil,
7 and for the drink offering you shall offer a third of a hin of wine as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
8 When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow or for peace offerings to the LORD,
9 then he shall offer with the bull a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil,
10 and you shall offer as the drink offering half a hin of wine as a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.


11 Thus it shall be done for each ox, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs or goats.
12 According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do for each one according to their number.
13 Every native among you shall do these things in this way, in presenting a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.


14 And if a foreigner lives among you, or whoever is among you throughout your generations, and he desires to offer a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD, he shall do as you do.
15 As for the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the foreigner who lives among you, a perpetual statute throughout your generations. As you are, so shall the foreigner be before the LORD.
16 There shall be one law and one ordinance for you and for the stranger who lives among you.’”


17 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
18 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come into the land where I bring you,
19 then, when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a contribution to the LORD.
20 Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake as a contribution; as the contribution from the threshing floor, so shall you offer it.
21 From the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD a contribution throughout your generations.’”


22 “But when you unintentionally fail and do not observe all these commandments which the LORD has spoken to Moses,
23 all that the LORD has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD gave the commandment and onward throughout your generations,
24 then if it was done unintentionally, without the knowledge of the congregation, then all the congregation shall offer one bull from the herd for a burnt offering, as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat as a sin offering.
25 Then the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and they shall be forgiven, for it was unintentional, and they have brought their offering, a food offering to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their error.
26 So all the congregation of the sons of Israel shall be forgiven, as well as the foreigner who lives among them, since it happened to all the people unintentionally.


27 If a person sins unintentionally, then he shall bring a female goat a year old for a sin offering.
28 And the priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the person who goes astray when he sins unintentionally, to make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
29 You shall have one law for him who does anything unintentionally, for him who is native among the sons of Israel and for the stranger who lives among them.
30 But the person who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native or a stranger, that one blasphemes the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from among his people.
31 Because he has despised the word of the LORD and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his guilt shall be upon him.”


32 Now while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
33 Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation.
34 They put him in custody, because it had not been made clear what should be done to him.
35 Then the LORD said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him outside the camp.”
36 So all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him, and he died, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.


37 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
38 “Speak to the sons of Israel, and tell them to make for themselves tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a cord of blue on the tassel of each corner.
39 And it shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the LORD, to do them, and not to follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you play the harlot,
40 so that you may remember to do all My commandments and be holy to your God.
41 I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God; I am the LORD your God.”




Chapter 16


1 Now Korah, son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men.
2 And they rebelled against Moses with some of the sons of Israel—two hundred fifty men from the congregation, leaders of the assembly, chosen men of the meeting, men of renown.
3 And they gathered together against Moses and against Aaron and said to them, “You take too much upon yourselves, for everyone in the congregation—all of them—are holy, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?”


4 When Moses heard this, he fell on his face.
5 Then he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, “In the morning the LORD will make known who is His and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to Him. The one whom He chooses, He will cause to come near to Him.
6 Do this: take censers, Korah and all his company,
7 and put fire in them and place incense on them before the LORD tomorrow. Then it shall be that the man whom the LORD chooses, he shall be the holy one. You sons of Levi take too much upon yourselves!”


8 Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi:
9 Is it too little for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near to Himself to perform the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?
10 And He has brought you near, and all your brothers, the sons of Levi, with you. And are you seeking the priesthood also?
11 Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against the LORD. And what is Aaron that you grumble against him?”


12 Then Moses sent to summon Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come up.
13 Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us?
14 Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of field and vineyard. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.”


15 Then Moses was very angry and said to the LORD, “Do not regard their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I harmed any of them.”
16 Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company be before the LORD tomorrow, you and they and Aaron.
17 And each man take his censer and put incense on it, and each man bring before the LORD his censer—two hundred fifty censers—you also and Aaron, each his censer.”
18 So each man took his censer and put fire in them and placed incense on them, and they stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
19 Then Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.


20 And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
21 “Separate yourselves from among this congregation, so that I may consume them in a moment.”
22 But they fell on their faces and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will You be angry with all the congregation?”


23 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
24 “Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’”
25 Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
26 And he spoke to the congregation, saying, “Turn away now from the tents of these wicked men and do not touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be swept away in all their sin.”


27 So they got back from around the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.
28 Moses said, “By this you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, and that it was not from my own heart:
29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they are visited by the fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me.
30 But if the LORD creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the grave, then you shall know that these men have despised the LORD.”


31 And it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground that was under them split apart.
32 And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, along with their households and all the men who belonged to Korah, with all their possessions.
33 So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into the grave, and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.
34 And all Israel who were around them fled at their outcry, for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up also!”
35 And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the two hundred fifty men who were offering the incense.


36 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
37 “Say to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, to take up the censers out of the burning and scatter the fire far away, for they have become holy.


38 The censers of these sinners against their own lives—let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, because they were presented before the LORD and became holy. They shall be a sign to the sons of Israel.”
39 So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had brought, and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar,
40 to be a memorial to the sons of Israel, so that no outsider, who is not of the seed of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the LORD, so that he does not become like Korah and his company—just as the LORD had spoken to him through Moses.


41 But on the next day, all the congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of the LORD.”
42 And then, when the congregation had assembled against Moses and Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting, and saw that the cloud which covered it and the glory of the LORD had appeared.
43 Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,
44 and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
45 “Get away from among this congregation, so that I may consume them in a moment.” But they fell on their faces.
46 And Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer and put fire from the altar in it and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them. For wrath has gone out from the LORD; the plague has begun.”
47 So Aaron took it, just as Moses had spoken, and ran into the midst of the assembly. And behold, the plague had begun among the people. So he put on the incense and made atonement for the people.
48 And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped.
49 Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died because of the matter of Korah.
50 And Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and the plague had been stopped.




Chapter 17


1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, and take from them one staff for each father's house, from all their leaders according to their fathers’ houses—twelve staffs. You shall write each man's name on his staff,
3 and you shall write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi, for there is to be one staff for the head of each of their fathers’ houses.
4 You shall place them in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
5 And it shall be that the staff of the man whom I choose will sprout. Thus I will put an end to the grumblings of the sons of Israel, which they are raising against you.”
6 So Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their leaders gave him staffs, one for each leader, according to their fathers’ houses—twelve staffs—and the staff of Aaron was among their staffs.
7 Then Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.


8 The next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and saw that the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted, and brought forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.
9 Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the LORD to all the sons of Israel, and they looked, and each man took his staff.
10 And the LORD said to Moses, “Put back the staff of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept as a sign for the rebellious, so that you may put an end to their grumblings against Me, and they do not die.”
11 So Moses did; just as the LORD commanded him, so he did.


12 Then the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone!
13 Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of the LORD, will die. Shall we all perish?”




Chapter 18


1 Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your father's house with you shall bear the guilt connected with the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you shall bear the guilt connected with your priesthood.
2 But bring also your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, with you, that they may be joined to you and minister to you while you and your sons are before the tent of the testimony.
3 They shall keep your guard and the duty of the whole tent, only they shall not come near the furnishings of the sanctuary and the altar, so that they do not die, neither they nor you.
4 They shall be joined to you and keep the duty of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent, and no outsider may come near you.
5 You shall keep the duty of the sanctuary and the duty of the altar, so that there will no longer be wrath on the sons of Israel.
6 I Myself have taken your brothers the Levites from among the sons of Israel; they are a gift to you, given to the LORD, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
7 But you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and within the veil, and you shall perform the services. I give your priesthood as a gift of service, but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death.


8 Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, “Now, I Myself have given you responsibility for My offerings, even all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you as a portion and to your sons as a perpetual statute.
9 This shall be yours from the most holy gifts, reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs, every grain offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every guilt offering of theirs, which they shall render to Me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.
10 As the most holy gifts you shall eat it; every male shall eat it. It shall be holy to you.
11 This also is yours: the contribution of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel. I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual statute. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.
12 All the best of the oil and all the best of the new wine and the grain, the firstfruits which they give to the LORD, I have given them to you.
13 The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours; everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.
14 Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.
15 Every firstborn of the womb of all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether man or beast, shall be yours; nevertheless, the firstborn of man you shall surely redeem, and the firstborn of unclean beasts you shall redeem.
16 And their redemption price, from a month old you shall redeem, by your valuation, five shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
17 But the firstborn of an ox or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall burn their fat as an offering by fire for a soothing aroma to the LORD.
18 Their meat shall be yours; it shall be yours like the breast of the wave offering and like the right thigh.
19 All the contributions of the holy gifts, which the sons of Israel offer to the LORD, I have given to you and to your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual statute. It is a covenant of salt forever before the LORD for you and for your descendants with you.”
20 Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in their land, nor shall you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the sons of Israel.


21 And to the sons of Levi, I have given all the tithe in Israel as an inheritance in return for their service, which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting.
22 And the sons of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting again, or they will bear sin and die.
23 But the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their guilt. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, and among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
24 For the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as a contribution to the LORD, I have given to the Levites as an inheritance; therefore I have said to them, ‘They shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel.’”


25 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
26 “Moreover, you shall speak to the Levites and say to them, ‘When you take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them as your inheritance, then you shall offer from it a contribution to the LORD, a tithe of the tithe.
27 Your contribution shall be reckoned to you as the grain from the threshing floor or the fullness from the winepress.
28 So you shall also offer a contribution to the LORD from all your tithes, which you receive from the sons of Israel; and from it you shall give the LORD’s contribution to Aaron the priest.
29 From all your gifts you shall offer every contribution due to the LORD, from all the best of them, the sacred part from them.’
30 You shall say to them, ‘When you offer the best part from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the produce of the threshing floor and as the produce of the winepress.
31 And you may eat it in every place, you and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.
32 And you will bear no sin by reason of it when you have offered the best of it. And you shall not profane the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, or you will die.’”




Chapter 19


1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
2 “This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded: Speak to the sons of Israel, that they bring to you a red heifer without defect, in which there is no blemish, and on which a yoke has never been placed.
3 You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and it shall be brought outside the camp, and one shall slaughter it in his presence.
4 Then Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle some of its blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.
5 And the heifer shall be burned in his sight; its hide and its flesh and its blood, with its refuse, shall be burned.
6 And the priest shall take cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning heifer.
7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp; but the priest shall be unclean until evening.
8 The one who burns it shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water and shall be unclean until evening.
9 Then a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and they shall be kept for the congregation of the sons of Israel for water for impurity; it is a purification offering.
10 And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening, and it shall be a perpetual statute for the sons of Israel and for the stranger who lives among them.


11 The one who touches the corpse of any man shall be unclean for seven days.
12 Then he shall purify himself from it on the third day then on the seventh day he shall be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean.
13 Anyone who touches a corpse, the body of a man who has died, and does not purify himself defiles the tabernacle of the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him.


14 This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean for seven days.
15 And every open vessel, which has no cover fastened on it, is unclean.


16 Also, anyone who in the open field touches one who has been slain with a sword, or who has died naturally, or a human bone, or a grave, shall be unclean for seven days.
17 Then for the unclean they shall take some of the ashes of the burned purification offering and pour running water over them into a vessel.
18 And a clean man shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there and on the one who touched the bone or the slain or the one who died naturally or the grave.
19 And the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify him. Then he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and shall be clean in the evening.


20 But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, for he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.
21 So it shall be a perpetual statute for them. And the one who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and the one who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.
22 And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean, and the person who touches it shall be unclean until evening.




Chapter 20


1 Then the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died there and was buried there.


2 Now there was no water for the congregation, and they assembled against Moses and against Aaron.
3 The people quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD!
4 Why then have you brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, for us and our cattle to die here?
5 And why have you made us come up from Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.”
6 Then Moses and Aaron came from the presence of the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to them.


7 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
8 “Take the staff, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will yield its water. So you shall bring out water for them from the rock and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.”


9 So Moses took the staff from before the LORD, just as He had commanded him.
10 Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock, and he said to them, “Listen now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?”
11 Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff, and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their cattle drank.
12 But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust in Me, to treat Me as holy in the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.”
13 These were the waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel contended with the LORD, and He proved Himself holy among them.
14 Then Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: “Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the hardship that has overtaken us:
15 our fathers went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers.
16 But when we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt. Now behold, we are at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.
17 Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, or drink water from a well. We will go along the king’s highway; we will not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.”


18 But Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through me, lest I come out against you with the sword.”
19 Then the sons of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway, and if we or our livestock drink of your water, then we will pay its price. Only let us pass through on foot—nothing more.”
20 But he said, “You shall not pass through.” And Edom came out against them with a heavy force and with a strong hand.
21 So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; then Israel turned away from him.


22 Now when they set out from Kadesh, the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.


23 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying,
24 “Aaron will be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land that I have given to the sons of Israel, because you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah.
25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up Mount Hor.
26 And strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. So Aaron will be gathered to his people and will die there.”
27 So Moses did just as the LORD had commanded, and they went up Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
28 After Moses had stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son, Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.




Chapter 21


1 Now when the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.
2 Then Israel made a vow to the LORD and said, “If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will devote their cities to destruction.”
3 The LORD listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites; and they devoted them and their cities to destruction. So the name of the place was called Hormah.


4 Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Sea of Reeds, to go around the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became impatient on the way.
5 The people spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you brought us up from Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread and no water, and our soul loathes this miserable food.”


6 Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, and many men of Israel died.
7 So the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD, that He may remove the serpents from us.” And Moses prayed for the people.
8 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make for yourself a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard; and it shall come about, that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, will live.”
9 So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on the standard, and it came about that if a serpent bit any man, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.


10 Now the sons of Israel set out and camped in Oboth.
11 Then they set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness which is opposite Moab, toward the sunrise.
12 From there they set out and camped in the valley of Zered.
13 From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites—for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
14 Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD,
“Waheb in Suphah and the wadis of the Arnon,
15 and the slope of the wadis that extends to the settlement of Ar
and leans to the border of Moab.”


16 From there they continued to Beer; that is the well where the LORD said to Moses, “Assemble the people, that I may give them water.”


17 Then Israel sang this song:
“Spring up, O well! Sing to it!
18 The well that the leaders sank,
that the nobles of the people dug,
with the scepter and with their staffs.”
And from the wilderness they continued to Mattanah,
19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
20 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the land of Moab, at the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the wasteland.


21 Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
22 “Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or vineyard; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the king’s highway until we have passed through your territory.”
23 But Sihon would not permit Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.
24 Then Israel struck him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the sons of Ammon, because the border of the sons of Ammon was fortified.
25 So Israel took all these cities, and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all its villages.
26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand as far as the Arnon.
27 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say,
“Come to Heshbon! Let it be built!
So let the city of Sihon be established.
28 For a fire went forth from Heshbon,
a flame from the city of Sihon;
it devoured Ar of Moab,
The tops of the heights of the Arnon.
29 Woe to you, O Moab!
You are ruined, O people of Chemosh!
He has given his sons as fugitives
and his daughters into captivity,
to Sihon, king of the Amorites.
30 But we have cast them down;
Heshbon is perished as far as Dibon,
and we laid waste as far as Nophah,
which reaches to Medeba.”


31 Thus Israel occupied the land of the Amorites.
32 Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.
33 Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to do battle at Edrei.
34 But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people and his land; and you shall do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”
35 So they struck him and his sons and all his people, until he had no survivor left; and they possessed his land.




Chapter 22


1 Then the sons of Israel set out and camped in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho.


2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
3 And Moab was exceedingly afraid of the people, because they were many; and Moab was distressed because of the sons of Israel.
4 So Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this assembly will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
5 So he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River, in the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, “Look, a people came out of Egypt; they cover the face of the earth, and they are occupying the land next to me.
6 Now please come, curse this people for me, for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that whomever you bless is blessed, and whomever you curse is cursed.”


7 So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand. And they came to Balaam and spoke Balak’s words to him.
8 And he said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will bring back word to you, as the LORD speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
9 And God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?”
10 And Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent word to me:
11 ‘Behold, the people that came out of Egypt cover the face of the earth; now come, curse them for me. Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out.’”
12 But God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”
13 So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, “Go back to your land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you.”
14 And the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”


15 Then Balak again sent princes, more numerous and more honorable than the first group.
16 And they came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, ‘Let nothing hinder you from coming to me,
17 for I will surely honor you greatly, and whatever you say to me I will do. Come then, curse this people for me.’”


18 But Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, “If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
19 Now please, you also stay here tonight, that I may know what more the LORD will say to me.”
20 And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise, go with them. But you shall say only the word which I speak to you.”


21 So Balaam rose in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.


22 But the anger of God was kindled because he went, and the angel of the LORD stood in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
23 And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his drawn sword in his hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back into the road.
24 Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on both sides.
25 And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD and pressed against the wall and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall, so he struck her again.
26 Then the angel of the LORD went farther and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right or the left.
27 And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD and lay down under Balaam. So Balaam’s anger burned, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
28 Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”
29 And Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have made a mockery of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now.”
30 And the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, upon which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you?” And he said, “No.”


31 Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his drawn sword in his hand. And he bowed down and fell on his face.
32 And the angel of the LORD said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me.
33 And the donkey saw me and turned aside before me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, I would surely have killed you by now and let her live.”
34 And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, “I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the road against me. Now therefore, if it is evil in your sight, I will turn back.”
35 But the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only the word that I tell you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
36 Now when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite city, which is on the border of the Arnon, at the farthest end of the territory.


37 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I indeed not able to honor you?”


38 And Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you now! Am I able to say anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.”
39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
40 And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep and sent some to Balaam and the princes who were with him.


41 Then in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal, and from there he saw the extremity of the camp of Israel.




Chapter 23


1 And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”
2 And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
3 And Balaam said to Balak, “Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell you.” So he went to a bare height.


4 And God met Balaam, and he said to him, “I have arranged the seven altars, and I have offered a bull and a ram on each altar.”
5 Then the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and tell him these words.”


6 So he returned to him, and he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the princes of Moab.
7 And he took up his discourse and said,
“From Aram Balak has brought me,
the king of Moab from the mountains of the east:
‘Come, curse Jacob for me,
and come, denounce Israel!’
8 How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?
And how shall I denounce whom the LORD has not denounced?
9 For from the top of the rocks I see him,
and from the hills I behold him;
behold, a people dwelling alone,
and not reckoning itself among the nations.
10 Who can count the dust of Jacob,
or number the fourth part of Israel?
Let me die the death of the upright,
and let my end be like his!”


11 Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them instead!”


12 And he answered and said, “Don’t I have to be careful to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?”


13 Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, from which you will see them. You will see only a part of them and not see them all; then curse them for me from there.”
14 So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
15 And he said to Balak, “Stand here beside your burnt offering, while I meet with him over there.”
16 And the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and say these words.”


17 So he came to him, as he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the LORD spoken?”
18 And he took up his discourse and said,
“Rise up, Balak, and hear;
give ear to me, O son of Zippor:
19 God is not a man, that he should lie,
or a son of man, that he should change his mind.
If He has spoken, won’t He then do it?
Or when He has promised, won’t He fulfill it?
20 Look! I received a command to bless:
He has blessed, and I cannot revoke it.
21 He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob,
nor has He seen trouble in Israel.
The LORD his God is with him,
and the shout of a king is among them.
22 God brings them out of Egypt;
He is for them like the horns of the wild ox.
23 For there is no enchantment against Jacob,
nor any divination against Israel.
Now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel,
‘What has God done!’
24 Behold, a people! As a lioness they rise up,
and as a lion they lift themselves;
it shall not lie down until it devours the prey
and drinks the blood of the slain.”


25 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them at all, and do not bless them at all!”


26 But Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘I must say whatever the LORD tells me’?”


27 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.”
28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the desert.
29 And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me seven altars here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”
30 So Balak did just as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.




Chapter 24


1 Then Balaam saw that it was good in the eyes of the LORD to bless Israel, and he did not go, as at other times, to meet with omens, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
2 When Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came upon him.


3 And he took up his discourse and said,
“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,
the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,
4 the oracle of him who hears the words of God,
who sees the vision of the Almighty,
falling down, yet with eyes uncovered:
5 How fair are your tents, O Jacob,
your dwelling places, O Israel!
6 Like valleys they are spread out,
like gardens beside a river,
like aloes that the LORD has planted,
like cedars beside the waters.
7 Water shall flow from his buckets,
and his seed shall be in many waters;
his king shall be higher than Agag,
and his kingdom shall be exalted.
8 God brings him out of Egypt;
he is for him like the horns of a wild ox.
He shall devour the nations, his adversaries,
and shall break their bones in pieces
and pierce them with his arrows.
9 He crouched, he lay down like a lion,
and like a lioness—who will rouse him?
Blessed are those who bless you,
and cursed are those who curse you.”


10 Then Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and yet, you have blessed them these three times.
11 Now therefore, go back home. I said I would honor you greatly, but the LORD has kept you back from honor.”
12 And Balaam said to Balak, “Didn’t I speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,
13 ‘Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own will. Whatever the LORD speaks, that is what I will speak’?


14 And now, though I am going to my own people, come, listen while I inform you what this people will do to your people in the latter days.”
15 And he took up his discourse and said,
“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,
the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,
16 the oracle of him who hears the words of God,
and knows the knowledge of the Most High,
who sees the vision of the Almighty,
falling down, yet with eyes uncovered:
17 I see him, but not now;
I behold him, but not near.
A star shall come out of Jacob,
and a scepter shall rise out of Israel;
it shall crush the forehead of Moab
and break down all the sons of Sheth.
18 Edom shall be dispossessed;
Seir also, his enemies, shall be dispossessed,
while Israel does valiantly.
19 And one from Jacob shall have dominion
and destroy the survivors from the city.”
20 And he looked on Amalek and took up his discourse and said,
“Amalek was the first among the nations,
but its end is utter destruction.”
21 And he looked on the Kenite and took up his discourse and said,
“Enduring is your dwelling place,
and your nest is set in the rock.
22 Nevertheless, Kain shall be burned,
until Asshur takes you away captive.”
23 And he took up his discourse and said,
“Alas, who shall live when God does this?
24 But ships shall come from Kittim
and shall afflict Asshur and shall afflict Eber,
and he also shall come to destruction.”


25 Then Balaam rose and went back to his place, and Balak also went his way.




Chapter 25


1 While Israel dwelled in Shittim, the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab.
2 They invited the people of Israel to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
3 So Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor, and the anger of the LORD burned against Israel.


4 The LORD said to Moses, “Take all the chiefs of the people and hang them before the LORD in broad daylight, so that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel.”
5 So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you must kill his men who have yoked themselves to Baal of Peor.”


6 Then it happened, that one of the sons of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, while they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
7 When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand.
8 He went after the man of Israel into the inner chamber and pierced both of them—the man of Israel and the woman through her belly. So the plague on the sons of Israel was stopped.
9 Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.


10 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
11 “Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has turned back my wrath from the sons of Israel, in that he was zealous with my zeal among them, so that I did not consume the sons of Israel in my jealousy.
12 Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace.
13 It shall be for him and for his descendants after him, a covenant of perpetual priesthood, because he was zealous for his God and made atonement for the sons of Israel.’”


14 The name of the man of Israel who was struck down with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a chief of a tribe belonging to the Simeonites.
15 The name of the Midianite woman who was struck down was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, the head of a tribe in Midian.


16 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
17 “Harass the Midianites and strike them down,
18 for they harassed you with their tricks, with which they deceived you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the chief of Midian, their sister, who was struck down on the day of the plague on account of Peor.”




Chapter 26


1 After the plague, the LORD spoke to Moses and to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, saying,
2 “Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ houses, all who are able to go out to war in Israel.”
3 So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
4 “Take a census from twenty years old and upward,” as the LORD commanded Moses.


Now the sons of Israel who came out of the land of Egypt were:


5 Reuben, the firstborn of Israel. The sons of Reuben were: of Hanoch, the clan of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the clan of the Palluites;
6 of Hezron, the clan of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the clan of the Carmites.
7 These were the clans of the Reubenites, and those numbered of them were 43,730.
8 The son of Pallu: Eliab.
9 The sons of Eliab: Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the same Dathan and Abiram, chosen from the congregation, who contended against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they contended against the LORD,
10 and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them with Korah, when that company died, when the fire devoured 250 men. They became a warning.
11 But the sons of Korah did not die.


12 The sons of Simeon by their clans were: of Nemuel, the clan of the Nemuelites; of Jamin, the clan of the Jaminites; of Jachin, the clan of the Jachinites;

19 The sons of Judah were Er and Onan, but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.
20 The sons of Judah by their clans were: of Shelah, the clan of the Shelanites; of Perez, the clan of the Perezites; of Zerah, the clan of the Zerahites.
21 The sons of Perez were: of Hezron, the clan of the Hezronites; of Hamul, the clan of the Hamulites.

23 The sons of Issachar by their clans were: of Tola, the clan of the Tolaites; of Puvah, the clan of the Punites;
24 of Jashub, the clan of the Jashubites; of Shimron, the clan of the Shimronites.
25 These were the clans of Issachar according to those numbered of them, 64,300.


26 The sons of Zebulun by their clans were: of Sered, the clan of the Seredites; of Elon, the clan of the Elonites; of Jahleel, the clan of the Jahleelites.
27 These were the clans of the Zebulunites according to those numbered of them, 60,500.


28 The sons of Joseph by their clans: Manasseh and Ephraim.
29 The sons of Manasseh: of Machir, the clan of the Machirites (and Machir fathered Gilead); of Gilead, the clan of the Gileadites.
30 These were the sons of Gilead: of Iezer, the clan of the Iezrites; of Helek, the clan of the Helekites;
31 of Asriel, the clan of the Asrielites; of Shechem, the clan of the Shechemites;
32 of Shemida, the clan of the Shemidaites; of Hepher, the clan of the Hepherites.
33 Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons, but daughters. The names of the daughters of Zelophehad were: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
34 These were the clans of Manasseh, and those numbered of them were 52,700.


35 These were the sons of Ephraim by their clans: of Shuthelah, the clan of the Shuthelahites; of Becher, the clan of the Becherites; of Tahan, the clan of the Tahanites.
36 And these were the sons of Shuthelah: of Eran, the clan of the Eranites.
37 These were the clans of the sons of Ephraim according to those numbered of them, 32,500. These were the sons of Joseph by their clans.


38 The sons of Benjamin by their clans were: of Bela, the clan of the Belaites; of Ashbel, the clan of the Ashbelites; of Ahiram, the clan of the Ahiramites;
39 of Shephupham, the clan of the Shuphamites; of Hupham, the clan of the Huphamites.
40 The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: of Ard, the clan of the Ardites; of Naaman, the clan of the Naamites.
41 These were the sons of Benjamin by their clans, and those numbered of them were 45,600.


42 These were the sons of Dan by their clans: of Shuham, the clan of the Shuhamites. These were the clans of Dan by their clans.
43 All the clans of the Shuhamites according to those numbered of them were 64,400.


44 The sons of Asher by their clans were: of Imnah, the clan of the Imnites; of Ishvi, the clan of the Ishvites; of Beriah, the clan of the Beriites.
45 Of the sons of Beriah: of Heber, the clan of the Heberites; of Malchiel, the clan of the Malchielites.
46 The name of the daughter of Asher was Serah.
47 These were the clans of the sons of Asher according to those numbered of them, 53,400.


48 The sons of Naphtali by their clans were: of Jahzeel, the clan of the Jahzeelites; of Guni, the clan of the Gunites;
49 of Jezer, the clan of the Jezerites; of Shillem, the clan of the Shillemites.
50 These were the clans of Naphtali according to those numbered of them, 45,400.


51 These were the sons of Israel who were numbered: 601,730.


52 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
53 “To these the land shall be divided for inheritance according to the number of names.
54 To the larger group you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller group a smaller inheritance; each shall be given its inheritance according to its numbered group.
55 However, the land shall be divided by lot; they shall inherit according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
56 Their inheritance shall be divided by lot between the many and the few.”


57 These were the numbered Levites by their clans: of Gershon, the clan of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the clan of the Kohathites; of Merari, the clan of the Merarites.
58 These were the clans of Levi: the clan of the Libnites, the clan of the Hebronites, the clan of the Mahlites, the clan of the Mushites, the clan of the Korahites. And Kohath fathered Amram.
59 The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt. She bore to Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.
60 And to Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
61 But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD.
62 Those numbered of them were 23,000, every male from a month old and upward. For they were not numbered among the sons of Israel, because no inheritance was given to them among the sons of Israel.


63 These are the ones who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
64 But among these there was not a man of those numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who had numbered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
65 For the LORD had said of them, “They shall surely die in the wilderness.” Not one of them was left, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.




Chapter 27


1 Then the daughters of Zelophehad drew near—the daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the clans of Manasseh the son of Joseph. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
2 They stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the leaders and all the congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting, saying,
3 “Our father died in the wilderness, but he was not among the company who gathered together against the LORD with Korah’s company; rather, he died in his own sin, and he had no sons.
4 Why should the name of our father be taken away from his clan because he had no son? Give us a possession among our father’s brothers.”


5 So Moses brought their case before the LORD.
6 Then the LORD said to Moses,
7 “The daughters of Zelophehad are right. You shall surely give them a possession of inheritance among their father’s brothers, and you shall transfer their father’s inheritance to them.
8 And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If a man dies and has no son, then you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
9 And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
10 And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.
11 And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the nearest kinsman in his clan, and he shall possess it. And this shall be a statute of judgment for the sons of Israel, just as the LORD commanded Moses.’”


12 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go up into this mountain of Abarim, and look at the land that I have given to the sons of Israel.
13 When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother was gathered,
14 because you rebelled against My word in the wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, to sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes.” (These were the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)


15 Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,
16 “Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,
17 who shall go out before them and come in before them, who shall lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD may not be like sheep that have no shepherd.”


18 So the LORD said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him.
19 Set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and commission him in their sight.
20 You shall invest him with some of your authority, so that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey.
21 He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the LORD. At his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the sons of Israel with him, even the whole congregation.”


22 So Moses did just as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.
23 Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.




Chapter 28


1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Command the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘You shall be careful to present to Me My offering, My food for My offerings by fire, as a pleasing aroma to Me, at their appointed times.’


3 And you shall say to them, ‘This is the offering by fire that you shall offer to the LORD: two male lambs a year old without blemish, day by day, as a regular burnt offering.
4 You shall offer the one lamb in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight,
5 together with a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with a quarter of a hin of beaten oil.
6 It is a regular burnt offering, which was established at Mount Sinai for a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.
7 And its drink offering shall be a quarter of a hin for each lamb; in the holy place you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to the LORD.
8 The other lamb you shall offer at twilight; like the grain offering of the morning, and like its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.


9 On the Sabbath day, two male lambs a year old without blemish, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, with its drink offering—
10 this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.


11 At the beginning of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD: two bulls from the herd, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old without blemish;
12 and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram;
13 and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering for each lamb—a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.
14 And their drink offerings shall be: half a hin of wine for a bull, a third of a hin for a ram, and a quarter of a hin for a lamb; this is the monthly burnt offering throughout the months of the year.
15 Also one male goat for a sin offering to the LORD shall be offered, besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.


16 On the fourteenth day of the first month is the LORD’s Passover.
17 And on the fifteenth day of this month is a feast; for seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten.
18 On the first day there shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no ordinary work.
19 And you shall offer an offering by fire, a burnt offering to the LORD: two bulls from the herd, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old. They shall be without blemish.
20 And their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah you shall offer for a bull, and two-tenths for the one ram.
21 You shall offer a tenth for each of the seven lambs,
22 and one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
23 You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a regular burnt offering.
24 You shall offer in this manner daily, for seven days, the food of an offering by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. It shall be offered besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
25 And on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no ordinary work.


26 Also on the day of the firstfruits, when you offer a grain offering of new grain to the LORD at your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no ordinary work.
27 And you shall offer a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD: two bulls from the herd, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old.
28 And their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram,
29 a tenth for each of the seven lambs;
30 and one male goat to make atonement for you.
31 Besides the regular burnt offering and its grain offering, you shall offer them, with their drink offerings. They shall be without blemish.




Chapter 29


1 On the first day of the seventh month you shall have a sacred assembly. You shall do no ordinary work. It shall be a day for you to blow the trumpet.


2 You shall offer a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD: one young bull, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, without blemish.
3 Their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the ram,
4 and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs.
5 Also one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
6 These are in addition to the burnt offering of the new moon, with its grain offering, and the regular burnt offering with its grain offering, and their drink offerings, according to the ordinance, for a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.


7 On the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have a sacred assembly and you shall afflict your souls. You shall do no work.
8 You shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD as a pleasing aroma: one young bull, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, without blemish.
9 And their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the one ram,
10 and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs.
11 Also one male goat for a sin offering, besides the sin offering of atonement, and the regular burnt offering and its grain offering, and their drink offerings.


12 On the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have a sacred assembly. You shall do no ordinary work, and you shall celebrate a feast to the LORD for seven days.

14 And their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for each of the thirteen bulls, two-tenths for each of the two rams,
15 and one-tenth for each of the fourteen lambs;
16 also one male goat for a sin offering, besides the regular burnt offering, its grain offering, and its drink offering.

39 These you shall offer to the LORD at your appointed times, besides your vows and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, for your grain offerings, for your drink offerings, and for your peace offerings.


40 And Moses told the sons of Israel all that the LORD had commanded Moses.




Chapter 30


1 Then Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, “This is what the LORD has commanded:
2 If a man vows a vow to the LORD or swears an oath to bind himself with a pledge, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.


3 If a woman vows a vow to the LORD and binds herself by a pledge, while in her father's house in her youth,
4 and her father hears her vow and her pledge by which she has bound herself, and he says nothing to her, then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge by which she has bound herself shall stand.
5 But if her father opposes her on the day he hears it, none of her vows or pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand; and the LORD will forgive her, because her father opposed her.


6 And if she marries while under her vows or the rash utterance of her lips by which she has bound herself,
7 and her husband hears it and says nothing to her on the day he hears it, then her vows shall stand, and her pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand.
8 But if, on the day her husband hears it, he forbids her, then he annuls her vow that is upon her and the rash utterance of her lips by which she bound herself; and the LORD will forgive her.


9 But any vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, anything by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her.


10 If a woman in her husband's house makes a vow or binds herself by a pledge with an oath,
11 and her husband hears of it and says nothing to her and does not oppose her, then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge by which she has bound herself shall stand.
12 But if her husband annuls them on the day he hears of them, then whatever proceeds from her lips concerning her vows or concerning the pledge of herself shall not stand; her husband has annulled them, and the LORD will forgive her.


13 Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may annul it.
14 But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows or all her pledges that are upon her; he has established them, because he said nothing to her on the day he heard of them.
15 But if he annuls them after he has heard them, then he shall bear her guilt.


16 These are the statutes that the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife and between a father and his daughter in her youth, while in her father’s house.




Chapter 31


1 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Avenge the sons of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered to your people.”


3 So Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute the LORD’s vengeance on Midian.
4 You shall send a thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel to the war.”
5 So there were conscripted from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
6 Moses sent them to the war, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the holy vessels and the trumpets for sounding in his hand.


7 And they warred against Midian, just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed every male.
8 They killed the kings of Midian along with the rest of their slain—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.


9 The sons of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones, and all their cattle, all their flocks, and all their goods they took as plunder.
10 Then they burned all their cities where they dwelt and all their camps with fire.
11 They took all the spoil and all the plunder, both of man and of beast.
12 And they brought the captives, the plunder, and the spoil to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the sons of Israel, at the camp on the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.


13 And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the congregation went out to meet them outside the camp.
14 But Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who came from the service in the war.
15 Moses said to them, “Have you let all the women live?
16 Look, these caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to act treacherously against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and so the plague came upon the congregation of the LORD.
17 Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man by lying with him.
18 But all the young women who have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.


19 And you, remain outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives.
20 And purify every garment and every article of leather, every item made of goats’ hair, and every article of wood.”


21 Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of the army who had gone to the battle, “This is the statute of the law that the LORD has commanded Moses:
22 Only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead—
23 everything that can withstand fire, you shall pass through fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless, it shall also be purified with the water for impurity. But whatever cannot withstand fire you shall pass through water.
24 And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you may come into the camp.”


25 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
26 “Take the count of the plunder that was taken, both of man and of beast, you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers’ households of the congregation.
27 And divide the plunder into two parts: between the men skilled in war who went out to battle and all the congregation.
28 Then levy a tribute to the LORD from the men of war who went out to battle: one of every five hundred, of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the flocks.
29 Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to the LORD.
30 And from the sons of Israel’s half you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the animals, and give them to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.”


31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
32 Now the plunder that remained of the spoil, which the men of war had taken, was 675,000 sheep,
33 72,000 cattle,
34 61,000 donkeys,
35 and 32,000 persons in all, of the women who had not known a man by lying with him.


36 And the half, the portion for those who went out to war, was in number 337,500 sheep,
37 and the LORD’s tribute of the sheep was 675.
38 And the cattle were 36,000, of which the LORD’s tribute was 72.
39 And the donkeys were 30,500, of which the LORD’s tribute was 61.
40 And the persons were 16,000, of whom the LORD’s tribute was 32 persons.
41 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD’s contribution, to Eleazar the priest, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.


42 And from the sons of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from the men who fought—
43 now the congregation’s half was 337,500 sheep,
44 36,000 cattle,
45 30,500 donkeys,
46 and 16,000 persons—
47 from the sons of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.


48 Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, approached Moses
49 and said to Moses, “Your servants have taken a census of the men of war who are under our command, and not one man of us is missing.
50 So we have brought the LORD’s offering, what each man found, articles of gold—armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.”
51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from them, all crafted articles.


52 And all the gold of the contribution that they presented to the LORD, from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, was 16,750 shekels.
53 (The men of war had taken plunder, each for himself.)
54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the sons of Israel before the LORD.




Chapter 32


1 Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock. And they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place was a place for livestock.
2 So the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,
3 “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,
4 the land which the LORD struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.”
5 Then they said, “If we have found favor in your eyes, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Do not bring us over the Jordan.”


6 But Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, “Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here?
7 Why will you discourage the heart of the sons of Israel from crossing into the land which the LORD has given them?
8 This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
9 For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the sons of Israel from going into the land that the LORD had given them.
10 So the LORD’s anger was kindled on that day, and He swore, saying,
11 ‘None of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not wholly followed Me—
12 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have wholly followed the LORD.’
13 And the LORD’s anger was kindled against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was consumed.
14 And behold, you have risen in your fathers’ place, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more the fierce anger of the LORD against Israel.
15 For if you turn away from following Him, He will again leave them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all this people.”


16 Then they came near to him and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our little ones,
17 but we ourselves will be armed and ready to go before the sons of Israel until we have brought them to their place. And our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
18 We will not return to our homes until each of the sons of Israel has received his inheritance.
19 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan toward the east.”


20 So Moses said to them, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for the war,
21 and every armed man of you will cross the Jordan before the LORD until He has driven His enemies from before Him,
22 and the land is subdued before the LORD—then afterward you shall return and be free from obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land shall be your possession before the LORD.
23 But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD, and be sure your sin will find you out.
24 Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what has proceeded out of your mouth.”


25 And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben said to Moses, “Your servants will do just as my lord commands.
26 Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of Gilead,
27 but your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, just as my lord says.”


28 So Moses gave orders concerning them to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers’ households of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
29 And Moses said to them, “If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, every man armed for battle before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession.
30 But if they do not cross over armed with you, then they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.”
31 And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, “What the LORD has said to your servants, we will do.
32 We will cross over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us on this side of the Jordan.”


33 So Moses gave to them—to the sons of Gad, to the sons of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph—the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land with its cities and their territories, the cities of the surrounding land.


34 And the sons of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
35 Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
36 Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities and sheepfolds.
37 And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
38 Nebo, and Baal-meon (their names being changed), and Sibmah. And they gave other names to the cities which they built.


39 And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
40 So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt in it.
41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took their villages and called them Havvoth-jair.
42 And Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah after his own name.




Chapter 33


1 These are the journeys of the sons of Israel, who came out from the land of Egypt by their divisions under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
2 Moses recorded their starting points according to their journeys at the command of the LORD, and these are their journeys according to their starting points:


3 They set out from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month. On the day after the Passover, the sons of Israel went out with a high hand before the eyes of all the Egyptians,
4 while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them. The LORD had also executed judgments against their gods.
5 So the sons of Israel set out from Rameses and camped at Succoth.
6 They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness.
7 They set out from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, which faces Baal-zephon, and they camped before Migdol.
8 They set out from Pi-hahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and they went a three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah.
9 They set out from Marah and came to Elim; and in Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there.
10 They set out from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
11 They set out from the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin.
12 They set out from the wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
13 They set out from Dophkah and camped at Alush.
14 They set out from Alush and camped at Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.
15 They set out from Rephidim and camped in the wilderness of Sinai.
16 They set out from the wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
17 They set out from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
18 They set out from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
19 They set out from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez.
20 They set out from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah.
21 They set out from Libnah and camped at Rissah.
22 They set out from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah.
23 They set out from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
24 They set out from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
25 They set out from Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
26 They set out from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
27 They set out from Tahath and camped at Terah.
28 They set out from Terah and camped at Mithkah.
29 They set out from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah.
30 They set out from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
31 They set out from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan.
32 They set out from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
33 They set out from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
34 They set out from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
35 They set out from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber.
36 They set out from Ezion-geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin, that is, Kadesh.
37 They set out from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, at the edge of the land of Edom.


38 Then Aaron the priest went up Mount Hor at the command of the LORD and died there in the fortieth year after the sons of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.
39 Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.


40 Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the sons of Israel.
41 They set out from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
42 They set out from Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
43 They set out from Punon and camped at Oboth.
44 They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, on the border of Moab.
45 They set out from Iye-abarim and camped at Dibon-gad.
46 They set out from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
47 They set out from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.
48 They set out from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan at Jericho.
49 They camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.


50 Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
51 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
52 then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their carved images, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places.
53 You shall take possession of the land and dwell in it, for I have given the land to you to possess it.
54 You shall divide the land by lot as an inheritance among your clans; to the larger you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give a smaller inheritance. Wherever the lot falls for anyone, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
55 But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those whom you let remain shall be as barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they shall trouble you in the land in which you dwell.
56 And it shall come to pass that as I planned to do to them, so I will do to you.’”




Chapter 34


1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2 “Command the sons of Israel and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance, the land of Canaan according to its boundaries.
3 Your southern border shall extend from the wilderness of Zin alongside Edom, and your southern border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea on the east.
4 Your border shall turn south of the ascent of Akrabbim and pass on to Zin, and its end shall be south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it shall reach to Hazar-addar and pass on to Azmon.
5 The border shall turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt, and its end shall be at the sea.


6 As for the western border, you shall have the Great Sea as a boundary; this shall be your western border.


7 This shall be your northern border: from the Great Sea you shall draw a line to Mount Hor.
8 From Mount Hor you shall draw a line to the entrance of Hamath, and the end of the border shall be at Zedad.
9 Then the border shall continue to Ziphron, and its end shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your northern border.


10 You shall draw your eastern border from Hazar-enan to Shepham.
11 The border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain, and the border shall go down and reach to the slope on the eastern side of the Sea of Chinnereth.
12 Then the border shall go down to the Jordan, and its end shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders all around.”


13 Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, “This is the land that you shall inherit by lot, which the LORD has commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half-tribe.
14 For the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their fathers’ houses and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to their fathers’ houses have received their inheritance, and the half-tribe of Manasseh has received its inheritance.
15 The two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan opposite Jericho, eastward toward the sunrise.”


16 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
17 “These are the names of the men who shall divide the land for you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.
18 And you shall take one leader from every tribe to divide the land for the inheritance.
19 These are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
20 of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud;
21 of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon;
22 of the tribe of the sons of Dan, a leader, Bukki the son of Jogli;
23 of the sons of Joseph: of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, a leader, Hanniel the son of Ephod;
24 and of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, a leader, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan;
25 of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun, a leader, Elizaphan the son of Parnach;
26 of the tribe of the sons of Issachar, a leader, Paltiel the son of Azzan;
27 of the tribe of the sons of Asher, a leader, Ahihud the son of Shelomi;
28 and of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, a leader, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.”
29 These are the ones whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance for the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan.




Chapter 35


1 The LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
2 “Command the sons of Israel that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession cities in which to dwell. You shall also give to the Levites pasture lands around the cities.
3 The cities shall be for them to dwell in, and their pasture lands shall be for their livestock and for their possessions and for all their animals.
4 The pasture lands of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall extend from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around.
5 You shall measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, on the south side two thousand cubits, on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the center. This shall be for them the pasture lands of the cities.
6 The cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give so that the manslayer who kills someone unintentionally may flee there. And in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities.
7 All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities, together with their pasture lands.
8 As for the cities which you shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel, from the larger tribes you shall take many, and from the smaller you shall take few. Each tribe shall give from its inheritance to the Levites in proportion to the inheritance that it receives.”


9 The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
10 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
11 then you shall select cities for yourselves to be cities of refuge, so that the manslayer who kills someone unintentionally may flee there.
12 The cities shall be for you a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer will not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment.
13 The cities which you are to give shall be your six cities of refuge.
14 You shall give three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.
15 These six cities shall be for refuge for the sons of Israel, for the foreigner, and for the temporary resident among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there.
16 But if he struck him with an iron object, so that he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.
17 And if he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which he might die, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.
18 Or if he struck him with a wooden object in the hand, by which he might die, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.
19 The avenger of blood himself shall put the murderer to death. When he meets him, he shall put him to death.
20 If he pushed him out of hatred, or threw something at him with premeditation, and he died,
21 or struck him with his hand in enmity, and he died, the one who struck him shall surely be put to death. He is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.
22 But if he pushed him suddenly without enmity, or threw something at him without lying in wait,
23 or with any stone by which a man might die, without seeing him, and it fell on him so that he died, though he was not his enemy and did not seek his harm,
24 then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances.
25 The congregation shall rescue the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge to which he fled. And he shall dwell in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.
26 But if the manslayer at any time goes beyond the border of his city of refuge to which he fled,
27 and the avenger of blood finds him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of blood,
28 because he should have stayed in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return to the land of his possession.


29 These things shall be a statute of judgment for you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
30 If anyone kills a man, the murderer shall be put to death on the evidence of multiple witnesses. But no one shall be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
31 Moreover, you shall not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death.
32 And you shall not accept a ransom for one who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may return to dwell in the land before the death of the high priest.
33 So you shall not pollute the land in which you are; for blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of the one who shed it.
34 You shall not defile the land in which you are living, in the midst of which I dwell; for I, the LORD, dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel.”




Chapter 36


1 The heads of the fathers’ houses of the clan of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the clans of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers’ houses of the sons of Israel.
2 They said, “The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel, and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
3 But if they marry any of the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received; so it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
4 And when the Jubilee of the sons of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received; so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”


5 Then Moses commanded the sons of Israel by the word of the LORD, saying, “The tribe of the sons of Joseph is right in what they are saying.
6 This is what the LORD has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad: ‘Let them marry whom they think best, only they must marry within the clan of the tribe of their father.’
7 So no inheritance of the sons of Israel shall be transferred from tribe to tribe, for each man of the sons of Israel shall hold to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
8 And every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the sons of Israel shall be wife to one of the clan of the tribe of her father, so that every man of the sons of Israel may possess the inheritance of his fathers.
9 Thus no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another tribe, for each man of the tribes of the sons of Israel shall hold to his own inheritance.”
10 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did.
11 Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married the sons of their uncles.
12 They were married into the clans of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the clan of their father.


13 These are the commandments and the ordinances which the LORD commanded through Moses to the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.﻿Deuteronomy
Chapter 1
1 These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
2 It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-Barnea.
3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the sons of Israel according to all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them,
4 after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth at Edrei.


5 Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this law, saying,
6 "The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, ‘You have dwelt long enough at this mountain.
7 Turn and set out, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland, in the Negev and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
8 See, I have set the land before you. Go in and possess the land that the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.’


9 "And I spoke to you at that time, saying, ‘I am not able to bear you alone.
10 The Lord your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
11 May the Lord, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times more than you are and bless you, as He has promised you!
12 How can I alone bear your burden and your load and your strife?
13 Take wise men of understanding, well-known among your tribes, and I will set them as heads over you.’ 


14 "And you answered me and said, ‘The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do.’
15 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and well-known men, and set them as heads over you, leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens, and officers for your tribes.
16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, ‘Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the foreigner who is with him.
17 You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s. And the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.’
18 And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.


19 "And we set out from Horeb and went through all that great and terrifying wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us, and we came to Kadesh-Barnea.
20 And I said to you, ‘You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us.
21 See, the Lord your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you. Do not fear or be dismayed.’


22 "Then all of you approached me and said, ‘Let us send men before us, that they may explore the land for us and bring us word again of the way by which we should go up and the cities into which we shall come.’
23 And the thing was good in my eyes, and I took twelve men from you, one man from each tribe.
24 And they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out.
25 And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us, and brought us word again and said, ‘It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us.’


26 "Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the Lord your God.
27 And you murmured in your tents and said, ‘Because the Lord hated us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.
28 Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, “The people are greater and taller than we are; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven. And besides, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.”’
29 Then I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, nor be afraid of them.
30 The Lord your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
31 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the Lord your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place.’
32 Yet in this matter you did not believe the Lord your God,
33 who went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.


34 "And the Lord heard the voice of your words and was angry, and He swore, saying,
35 ‘Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers,
36 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his sons I will give the land on which he has trodden, because he has wholly followed the Lord!’
37 Also the Lord was angry with me because of you, saying, ‘You also shall not go in there.
38 Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
39 And your little ones, whom you said would become a prey, and your sons, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.
40 But as for you, turn and set out toward the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.’


41 "Then you answered and said to me, ‘We have sinned against the Lord. We will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us.’ And every man of you girded on his weapons of war and thought it easy to go up into the hill country.
42 And the Lord said to me, ‘Say to them, “Do not go up nor fight, for I am not in your midst, lest you be struck down before your enemies.”’
43 So I spoke to you, and you would not listen, but you rebelled against the command of the Lord and presumptuously went up into the hill country.
44 And the Amorites who dwelt in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah.
45 And you returned and wept before the Lord, but the Lord did not listen to your voice or give ear to you.
46 So you dwelt in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you dwelt there."
Chapter 2
1 Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord had spoken to me, and we circled Mount Seir for many days.
2 And the Lord said to me,
3 “You have circled this mountain long enough; turn northward.
4 And command the men, saying, ‘You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the sons of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful.
5 Do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even the tread of the sole of a foot, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.
6 You shall purchase food from them with silver so that you may eat, and you shall also buy water from them with silver so that you may drink.
7 For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands; He knows your journeying through this great wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.’”


8 So we passed by our brothers, the sons of Esau who live in Seir, away from the way of the Arabah, away from Elath and Ezion-geber. Then we turned and passed through the way of the wilderness of Moab.
9 And the Lord said to me, “Do not harass Moab or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession.”
10 (The Emim formerly lived there, a great and numerous nation, as tall as the Anakim.
11 They also are regarded as Rephaim, like the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim.
12 The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the Lord gave to them.)
13 “Now rise up and cross over the brook Zered.” So we crossed over the brook Zered.
14 And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war had perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn to them.
15 For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from the camp until they had perished.


16 So it came to pass, when all the men of war had finally perished from among the men,
17 that the Lord spoke to me, saying,
18 “Today you are to cross over at Ar, the border of Moab.
19 And when you approach the sons of Ammon, do not harass them or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.”
20 (It also is regarded as a land of Rephaim; Rephaim formerly lived there, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
21 a great and numerous nation, as tall as the Anakim. But the Lord destroyed the Rephaim as the Ammonites progressed, and they dispossessed them and settled in their place,
22 just as He did for the sons of Esau who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; they dispossessed them and have settled in their place even to this day.
23 And the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)
24 “Rise up, set out, and cross over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to possess it and engage him in battle.
25 This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the nations under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.”


26 So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
27 “Let me pass through your land; I will go only by the road, I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.
28 You shall sell me food for silver so that I may eat, and give me water for silver so that I may drink. Only let me pass through on foot,
29 as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I cross the Jordan into the land that the Lord our God is giving us.”
30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through, for the Lord your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into your hand, as it is this day.
31 And the Lord said to me, “Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to possess it, that you may inherit his land.”
32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his men, to battle at Jahaz.
33 And the Lord our God delivered him over to us, and we struck him down, along with his sons and all his men.
34 And we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed every city—men, women, and children; we left no survivor.
35 Only the livestock we took as spoil for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities that we captured.
36 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; the Lord our God gave all into our hands.
37 Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, all along the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, just as the Lord our God had commanded.
Chapter 3
1 Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og, king of Bashan, came out against us, he and all his army, to battle at Edrei.
2 The Lord said to me, "Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his army and his land into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."
3 So the Lord our God gave into our hand Og, king of Bashan, and all his army. We struck him down until no survivor was left to him.
4 We captured all his cities at that time; there was not a town that we did not take from them—sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
5 All these were fortified cities with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a great many unwalled villages.
6 We devoted them to destruction, as we did to Sihon, king of Heshbon, devoting to destruction every city—men, women, and children.
7 But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as plunder for ourselves.


8 So at that time we took the land from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon
9 (the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir),
10 all the cities of the plain and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
11 (For only Og, king of Bashan, was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. His bed was a bed of iron. Is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its width, according to the cubit of a man.)


12 So we took possession of this land at that time. From Aroer, which is by the Valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites.
13 The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh (all the region of Argob, all that Bashan, is called the land of Rephaim).
14 Jair, son of Manasseh, took all the region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he called them, that is Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.
15 To Machir I gave Gilead,
16 and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a border, as far as the river Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites;
17 the Arabah also, with the Jordan river as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, below the slopes of Pisgah on the east.


18 I commanded you at that time, saying, "The Lord your God has given you this land to possess it. You shall cross over armed before your brothers, the sons of Israel, all the men of valor.
19 But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities that I have given you,
20 until the Lord gives rest to your brothers as to you, and they also possess the land that the Lord your God is giving them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession that I have given you."
21 I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, "Your eyes have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings. So the Lord will do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing.
22 You shall not fear them, for it is the Lord your God who fights for you."


23 I pleaded with the Lord at that time, saying,
24 "O Lord God, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as yours?
25 Please let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon."
26 But the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. The Lord said to me, "Enough from you; do not speak to me of this matter again.
27 Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes to the west and north and south and east, and see it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.
28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him, for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land that you shall see."
29 So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
Chapter 4
1 Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments that I am teaching you to do, so that you may live and go in and possess the land that the Lord, the God of your fathers, is giving you.
2 You shall not add to the word that I am commanding you, nor shall you take away from it, so that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God that I am commanding you.
3 Your eyes have seen what the Lord did at Baal-peor, for every man who followed Baal-peor, the Lord your God destroyed him from among you.
4 But you who held fast to the Lord your God are alive, every one of you, this day.
5 See, I have taught you statutes and judgments just as the Lord my God commanded me, so that you should do them in the land where you are entering to possess it.
6 So keep them and do them, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, who will hear all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”
7 For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the Lord our God is to us whenever we call upon Him?
8 And what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as righteous as all this law that I am setting before you today?


9 Only take care of yourself and guard your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your sons and your sons’ sons—
10 the day that you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when the Lord said to me, “Assemble the people to Me, and I will make them hear My words, so that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and that they may teach their sons.”
11 And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire up to the heart of heaven—darkness, cloud, and thick gloom.
12 Then the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard the sound of words, but you saw no form—only a voice.
13 And He declared to you His covenant, which He commanded you to do—the Ten Commandments—and He wrote them on two tablets of stone.
14 The Lord also commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, so that you might do them in the land where you are crossing over to possess it.


15 So guard your souls carefully, for you saw no form on the day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire,
16 lest you act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of any figure—the likeness of male or female,
17 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,
18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water below the earth.
19 And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars—all the host of heaven—and be drawn away and worship them and serve them, which the Lord your God has allotted to all the nations under the whole heaven.
20 But the Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be a people for His own possession, as you are this day.


21 Now the Lord was angry with me because of you, and He swore that I would not cross the Jordan and that I would not enter the good land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.
22 For I must die in this land; I shall not cross the Jordan, but you will cross over and possess that good land.
23 Take care of yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the Lord your God that He made with you, and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of anything that the Lord your God has forbidden you.
24 For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.


25 When you have sons and grandsons, and you have been long in the land, and you act corruptly and make a carved image in the form of anything, and do evil in the sight of the Lord your God to provoke Him to anger,
26 I call today on heaven and earth as witnesses against you, that you will surely perish quickly from the land where you are crossing the Jordan to possess it; you will not prolong your days on it, but you will be utterly destroyed.
27 And the Lord will scatter you among the nations, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the Lord will drive you.
28 And there you will serve gods, the work of a man’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell.
29 But from there you will seek the Lord your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and with all your soul.
30 When you are in distress and all these things have come upon you, in the later days, you will return to the Lord your God and listen to His voice.
31 For the Lord your God is a merciful God; He will not abandon you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers that He swore to them.


32 For ask now about the former days that were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from one end of heaven to the other, whether there has been anything like this great thing, or whether anything like it has been heard.
33 Has a people heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and lived?
34 Or has a god tried to go and take for himself a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
35 To you it was shown, so that you might know that the Lord, He is God; there is no other besides Him.
36 From heaven He made you hear His voice to discipline you, and on earth He showed you His great fire, and you heard His words from the midst of the fire.
37 And because He loved your fathers, He chose their seed after them and brought you out of Egypt with His presence, with His great power,
38 driving out before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land as an inheritance, as it is this day.
39 Know today, and take it to your heart, that the Lord, He is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other.
40 So you shall keep His statutes and His commandments that I command you today, so that it may go well with you and with your sons after you, and that you may prolong your days on the land that the Lord your God is giving you forever.


41 Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan toward the sunrise,
42 so that a manslayer might flee there, one who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without hating him in the past, and by fleeing to one of these cities he might live:
43 Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.


44 And this is the law that Moses set before the sons of Israel.
45 These are the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments that Moses spoke to the sons of Israel when they came out of Egypt,
46 across the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel struck down when they came out of Egypt.
47 And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were across the Jordan toward the sunrise,
48 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, even as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon),
49 and all the Arabah across the Jordan to the east, even as far as the sea of the Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah.
Chapter 5
1 Moses called all Israel together and said to them, “Listen, Israel, to the statutes and regulations that I proclaim in your hearing today. Learn them and make sure to follow them carefully.
2 The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
3 It wasn’t with our ancestors that the Lord made this covenant, but with us—those of us who are alive here today.
4 The Lord spoke to you face-to-face at the mountain, right out of the fire.
5 I stood between the Lord and you at that time to tell you what the Lord was saying, because you were afraid of the fire and didn’t go up the mountain. He said:


6 ‘I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
7 You must not have any other gods besides me.


8 You must not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above, on the earth below, or in the waters beneath.
9 You must not bow down to them or worship them, because I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. I bring the consequences of the parents’ sin onto the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
10 but I show faithful love to thousands of generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.


11 You must not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not let anyone go unpunished who misuses his name.


12 Observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy, just as the Lord your God commanded you.
13 Work for six days and do all your tasks,
14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath dedicated to the Lord your God. On it, you must not do any work—not you, your son, your daughter, your male or female servant, your ox, your donkey, any of your livestock, or the foreigner living in your towns—so that your male and female servants can rest just like you.
15 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That’s why the Lord your God commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.


16 Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God commanded you, so that you may live a long life and things may go well for you in the land the Lord your God is giving you.


17 You must not murder.


18 You must not commit adultery.


19 You must not steal.


20 You must not give false testimony against your neighbor.


21 You must not covet your neighbor’s wife. You must not desire your neighbor’s house, his field, his male or female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.’


22 These are the words the Lord spoke to your whole assembly at the mountain. He spoke from the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness with a loud voice, and he added nothing more. He wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.
23 When you heard the voice coming from the darkness while the mountain was burning with fire, you—all your tribal leaders and elders—came up to me.
24 You said, ‘Look, the Lord our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we’ve heard his voice from the fire. Today we’ve seen that a person can live even after God speaks with them.
25 But now, why should we die? This massive fire will consume us! If we keep hearing the voice of the Lord our God, we’ll die.
26 Has any human ever heard the voice of the living God speaking from the middle of the fire, like we have, and survived?
27 You go near and listen to everything the Lord our God says, then tell us whatever the Lord our God tells you. We’ll listen and obey.’


28 The Lord heard what you said when you spoke to me, and the Lord said to me, ‘I’ve heard the words these people have spoken to you. Everything they’ve said is right.
29 If only they would always have this kind of heart—one that fears me and keeps all my commandments—so that things would go well for them and their children forever!
30 Go tell them, “Return to your tents.”
31 But you, stay here with me, and I’ll give you all the commandments, statutes, and regulations you’re to teach them, so they can follow them in the land I’m giving them to possess.’


32 So be careful to do exactly what the Lord your God has commanded you—don’t turn aside to the right or the left.
33 Walk in all the ways the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live, prosper, and enjoy a long life in the land you’re about to possess.
Chapter 6
1 These are the commands, statutes, and judgments that the Lord your God has ordered me to teach you, so that you may obey them in the land you are crossing over to possess,
2 that you may fear the Lord your God by keeping all his statutes and commands that I am giving you—you, your son, and your grandson—all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged.
3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do them, that it may go well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.


4 Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
5 You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.
6 These words that I command you today shall be on your heart.
7 You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.
8 You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
9 You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.


10 When the Lord your God brings you into the land that he swore to your fathers—to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob—to give you, with great and good cities that you did not build,
11 houses full of all good things that you did not fill, cisterns dug out that you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant—and you eat and are satisfied,
12 then watch yourself, lest you forget the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
13 You shall fear the Lord your God; him you shall serve, and by his name you shall swear.
14 You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are around you—
15 for the Lord your God in your midst is a jealous God—lest the anger of the Lord your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from the face of the earth.


16 You shall not test the Lord your God, as you tested him at Massah.
17 You shall diligently keep the commands of the Lord your God, his testimonies, and his statutes that he has commanded you.
18 You shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may go well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land that the Lord swore to your fathers to give you,
19 by driving out all your enemies from before you, as the Lord has spoken.


20 When your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What are the testimonies, statutes, and judgments that the Lord our God has commanded you?’
21 then you shall say to your son, ‘We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
22 The Lord showed signs and wonders, great and grievous, against Egypt, against Pharaoh, and against all his household, before our eyes.
23 He brought us out from there, that he might bring us in to give us the land that he swore to our fathers to give us.
24 The Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is this day.
25 It will be righteousness for us if we are careful to do all this commandment before the Lord our God, as he has commanded us.’
Chapter 7
1 When the Lord your God brings you into the land you’re about to enter and take possession of, he will drive out many nations before you: the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—seven nations larger and stronger than you.
2 When the Lord your God hands them over to you and you defeat them, you must completely destroy them. Don’t make any treaties with them or show them any mercy.
3 Don’t intermarry with them—don’t give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,
4 because they’ll turn your children away from following me to serve other gods. Then the Lord’s anger will burn against you, and he’ll quickly destroy you.
5 Instead, this is what you should do to them: tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their carved idols with fire.
6 You are a holy people belonging to the Lord your God. Out of all the peoples on the face of the earth, the Lord your God has chosen you to be his treasured possession.


7 It wasn’t because you were more numerous than other peoples that the Lord set his affection on you and chose you—after all, you were the smallest of all peoples.
8 But it was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from slavery, from the power of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
9 Know this: the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who keeps his covenant of love for a thousand generations with those who love him and obey his commands.
10 But he repays those who hate him, right to their faces by destroying them; he won’t delay with anyone who hates him—he’ll repay them directly.
11 So keep the commands, decrees, and laws I command you today and follow them.


12 If you listen to these laws and are careful to follow them, the Lord your God will keep his covenant of love with you, just as he swore to your ancestors.
13 He will love you, bless you, and increase your numbers. He’ll bless the children you bear, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine, and olive oil—and the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you.
14 You’ll be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be barren.
15 The Lord will keep every disease away from you, and he won’t bring on you any of the terrible sicknesses you knew in Egypt—he’ll put them on all who hate you instead.
16 You must destroy all the peoples the Lord your God hands over to you. Don’t look on them with pity, and don’t serve their gods, because that will trap you.


17 You might say to yourself, “These nations are stronger than we are—how can we drive them out?”
18 But don’t be afraid of them. Remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt:
19 the great trials you saw with your own eyes, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God brought you out. He’ll do the same to all the peoples you’re afraid of now.
20 The Lord your God will even send the hornet against them until those who are left and hiding from you are wiped out.
21 Don’t be terrified of them, because the Lord your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God.
22 The Lord your God will drive out those nations before you little by little. You won’t be able to finish them off all at once, or the wild animals will multiply too much for you.
23 But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you and throw them into total panic until they’re destroyed.
24 He’ll hand their kings over to you, and you’ll wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand against you until you’ve destroyed them.
25 Burn the carved idols of their gods with fire. Don’t covet the silver or gold on them or take it for yourselves, or you’ll be ensnared by it—it’s detestable to the Lord your God.
26 Don’t bring anything detestable into your house, or you’ll be marked for destruction just like it. Consider it utterly repulsive and detestable, because it’s set apart for destruction.
Chapter 8
1 "You must be careful to follow every commandment that I command you today, so that you can live, grow in number, and enter and take possession of the land that the Lord promised to your ancestors.
2 Remember how the Lord your God led you through the wilderness these past forty years, to humble you and test you, to find out what was in your heart—whether you’d keep His commands or not.
3 He humbled you by letting you go hungry, then fed you with manna, something neither you nor your ancestors had ever known, to teach you that people don’t live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.
4 Your clothes didn’t wear out, and your feet didn’t swell during those forty years.
5 So, understand this in your heart: just as a parent disciplines their child, the Lord your God disciplines you."


6 "So keep the commandments of the Lord your God by walking in His ways and respecting Him.
7 Because the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land—a land with streams, springs, and deep waters flowing through hills and valleys,
8 a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil, and honey,
9 a land where you’ll eat without scarcity, where you won’t lack anything, a land whose rocks are iron and whose hills you can mine for copper.
10 When you’ve eaten and are satisfied, praise the Lord your God for the good land He’s given you."


11 "But be careful not to forget the Lord your God by failing to keep His commandments, laws, and decrees that I command you today.
12 Otherwise, when you’ve eaten your fill, built nice houses to live in,
13 and your herds and flocks multiply, your silver and gold increase, and everything you have grows,
14 your heart might become proud, and you could forget the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt, out of the slave house.
15 He led you through the vast, terrifying wilderness with its venomous snakes and scorpions, a dry place with no water, where He brought water out of solid rock for you.
16 He fed you manna in the wilderness, something your ancestors had never seen, to humble you and test you, so that in the end it would go well with you.
17 Don’t ever think to yourself, ‘My own power and the strength of my hands made all this wealth for me.’
18 Instead, remember the Lord your God, because He’s the one who gives you the ability to produce wealth, confirming His covenant that He swore to your ancestors, as it stands today."


19 "But if you ever forget the Lord your God and chase after other gods, worshiping and bowing to them, I testify against you today, that you will certainly be destroyed.
20 Like the nations the Lord is wiping out before you, that’s how you’ll be destroyed if you don’t obey the Lord your God."
Chapter 9
1 Listen, Israel: You’re about to cross the Jordan today to go in and take over nations bigger and stronger than you—cities with massive, sky-high walls.
2 The people there are the Anakites, huge and tall. You’ve heard the saying, “Who can stand up to the Anakites?”
3 But know today, that the Lord your God is the one crossing ahead of you like a consuming fire. He’ll destroy them and bring them down before you. You’ll drive them out and wipe them out fast, just as the Lord promised you.


4 When the Lord your God pushes them out in front of you, don’t think to yourself, “It’s because I’m so righteous that the Lord brought me here to take this land.” No, it’s because of how wicked these nations are that the Lord is driving them out before you.
5 It’s not your righteousness or your upright character that’s getting you this land to possess. It’s because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord your God is forcing them out ahead of you—and to keep the promise He swore to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
6 So get this straight: the Lord your God isn’t giving you this good land to possess because you’re righteous. You’re a stubborn, stiff-necked people.


7 Remember—don’t forget—how you provoked the Lord your God to anger in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you got here, you’ve been rebellious against the Lord.
8 Even at Horeb, you made the Lord so furious that He was ready to destroy you.
9 When I went up the mountain to get the stone tablets—the tablets of the covenant the Lord made with you—I stayed there forty days and forty nights, not eating bread or drinking water.
10 The Lord gave me the two stone tablets, written by God’s own finger, with everything He said to you on the mountain from the fire on the day of the assembly.


11 After those forty days and nights, the Lord handed me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
12 Then the Lord said to me, “Get up, head down from here quick, because the people you brought out of Egypt have ruined everything. They’ve already turned away from the way I commanded them and made themselves a cast-metal idol.”
13 The Lord also told me, “I’ve seen this people, and they’re a stubborn, stiff-necked bunch.
14 Leave me alone so I can destroy them and erase their name from under heaven. Then I’ll make you into a nation stronger and bigger than they are.”


15 So I turned and came down the mountain while it was still blazing with fire, holding the two tablets of the covenant in my hands.
16 And I saw it—you’d sinned against the Lord your God. You’d made yourselves a cast-metal calf, quickly abandoning the way the Lord had commanded you.
17 I grabbed the two tablets and threw them down, smashing them right in front of you.
18 Then I fell down before the Lord like before, for forty days and forty nights, not eating bread or drinking water, because of all the sin you’d committed—doing what was evil in the Lord’s eyes and provoking Him to anger.
19 I was terrified of the Lord’s burning anger, how furious He was, ready to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me that time too.


20 The Lord was also furious enough with Aaron to destroy him, but I prayed for Aaron at the same time.
21 As for that sinful thing you made—the calf—I took it, burned it in the fire, crushed it, and ground it into fine dust. Then I threw the dust into the stream running down the mountain.


22 You also provoked the Lord at Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah.
23 And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, “Go up and take the land I’ve given you,” you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God. You didn’t trust Him or listen to Him.
24 You’ve been rebellious against the Lord ever since I’ve known you.


25 So I fell down before the Lord for those forty days and forty nights because the Lord had said He’d destroy you.
26 I prayed to the Lord and said, “Lord God, don’t destroy Your people, Your inheritance that You redeemed with Your greatness, the ones You brought out of Egypt with a strong hand.
27 Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t focus on the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness, or their sin,
28 or else the land we came from will say, ‘The Lord couldn’t bring them into the land He promised, and He hated them, so He brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’
29 But they’re Your people, Your inheritance, the ones You brought out with Your great power and outstretched arm.”
Chapter 10
1 At that time, the Lord said to me, “Carve out two stone tablets like the first ones, and come up to me on the mountain. Also, make a wooden chest.
2 I’ll write on the tablets the words that were on the first ones, which you broke, and you’ll place them in the chest.”
3 So I made a chest out of acacia wood, carved two stone tablets like the originals, and went up the mountain with the tablets in my hands.
4 Then the Lord wrote on the tablets the same words as before—the Ten Commandments He had spoken to you on the mountain from the middle of the fire on the day of the assembly. After that, He gave them to me.
5 I turned and came down the mountain and put the tablets in the chest I had made, just as the Lord commanded me. They’re still there today.


6 Now, the Israelites traveled from the wells of the Bene-jaakan to Moserah. That’s where Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar took over as priest in his place.
7 From there, they moved on to Gudgodah, and then to Jotbathah, a land with flowing streams.
8 At that time, the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the chest of the Lord’s covenant, to stand before Him and serve Him, and to bless people in His name—a role they still have today.
9 That’s why Levi doesn’t get a share of land or inheritance like the other tribes; the Lord Himself is their inheritance, just as He promised them.


10 I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, just like the first time. The Lord listened to me again and decided not to destroy you.
11 Then the Lord said to me, “Get up and go lead the people on their journey, so they can enter and take possession of the land I swore to their ancestors I’d give them.”


12 So now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you? Only this: to respect the Lord your God, to follow all His ways, to love Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and soul,
13 keeping His commandments and laws that I command you today for your own good.
14 Look, the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth, and everything in them belong to the Lord your God.
15 Yet the Lord chose your ancestors to love them, and He picked their descendants—you—above all other nations, as you see today.
16 So circumcise your hearts and stop being stubborn,
17 because the Lord your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords—the great, mighty, and awesome God who doesn’t play favorites or take bribes.
18 He defends the cause of orphans and widows, and He loves the foreigner living among you, giving them food and clothing.
19 You’re to love the foreigner too, since you were foreigners in Egypt.
20 Respect the Lord your God, serve Him, stay close to Him, and swear by His name.
21 He’s your praise; He’s your God who did these great and awesome things for you that you’ve seen with your own eyes.
22 Your ancestors went down to Egypt as a group of seventy, and now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.
Chapter 11
1 You must love the Lord your God and always keep His requirements, His statutes, His judgments, and His commandments.
2 Recognize today—since I’m not speaking to your children who haven’t experienced or witnessed it—the discipline of the Lord your God, His greatness, His strong hand, and His outstretched arm,
3 His signs and His deeds that He performed in Egypt against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and his entire land,
4 and what He did to Egypt’s army, to their horses and chariots, when He made the waters of the Red Sea overwhelm them as they chased after you, and the Lord destroyed them completely up to this day.
5 Also consider what He did for you in the wilderness until you arrived at this place,
6 and what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab from the tribe of Reuben, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and everything they owned, right in the middle of all Israel.
7 Your own eyes have seen all these great acts of the Lord.


8 So keep every commandment I’m giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take possession of the land you’re about to enter,
9 and so that you may live long in the land the Lord swore to your ancestors to give them and their descendants—a land flowing with milk and honey.
10 The land you’re about to enter and possess isn’t like the land of Egypt, where you came from, where you had to sow your seed and irrigate it by foot, like a vegetable garden.
11 No, the land you’re crossing into is a land of hills and valleys; it drinks water from the rain of heaven.
12 It’s a land the Lord your God cares for; the eyes of the Lord your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year to its end.


13 If you faithfully obey the commandments that I command you today—to love the Lord your God and serve Him with all your heart and all your soul—
14 then He will provide rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the late rain, so you can gather your grain, your new wine, and your oil.
15 He’ll also make grass grow in your fields for your livestock, and you’ll eat and be satisfied.
16 But be careful, or your hearts might be deceived, and you’ll turn away to serve other gods and worship them.
17 Then the Lord’s anger will burn against you; He’ll shut up the heavens so there’s no rain, the land won’t yield its produce, and you’ll quickly perish from the good land the Lord is giving you.


18 So take these words of mine to heart and soul; tie them as a sign on your hands and let them be a reminder on your foreheads.
19 Teach them to your children, talking about them when you’re sitting at home, when you’re walking along the road, when you lie down, and when you get up.
20 Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates,
21 so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors, as long as the heavens remain above the earth.


22 If you diligently keep all these commandments I’m giving you—loving the Lord your God, walking in all His ways, and holding fast to Him—
23 then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you’ll dispossess nations greater and stronger than you.
24 Every place where the sole of your foot steps will be yours; your territory will stretch from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the western sea.
25 No one will be able to stand against you; the Lord your God will put fear and dread of you on all the land you tread, just as He promised you.


26 Look, today I’m setting before you a blessing and a curse:
27 the blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I’m giving you today,
28 and the curse if you don’t obey the commandments of the Lord your God and turn from the way I’m commanding you today, following other gods you haven’t known.
29 When the Lord your God brings you into the land you’re about to possess, you must pronounce the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
30 Aren’t these mountains across the Jordan, west of the road toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, near the oaks of Moreh?
31 You’re about to cross the Jordan to enter and possess the land the Lord your God is giving you; you’ll take it and live in it.
32 So be careful to follow all the statutes and judgments I’m setting before you today.




Chapter 12


1 These are the statutes and ordinances that you must diligently observe in the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has given you to possess, all the days that you live on the earth.
2 You must completely destroy all the places where the nations you are dispossessing worshiped their gods—on the high mountains, on the hills, and under every green tree.
3 Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, burn their Asherah poles with fire, and chop down the carved images of their gods. Wipe out their names from that place.
4 Do not worship the Lord your God in the same way they did.
5 Instead, seek the Lord at the place that the Lord your God will choose out of all your tribes to establish his name there as his dwelling, and go there.
6 Bring there your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the contributions of your hand, your vowed offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.
7 There, in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your households will eat and rejoice in all the work of your hands, because the Lord your God has blessed you.


8 You must not do as we are doing here today, where everyone does whatever seems right in their own eyes,
9 for you have not yet come to the resting place and the inheritance that the Lord your God is giving you.
10 But when you cross the Jordan and settle in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you so that you live in safety,
11 then to the place that the Lord your God will choose to make his name dwell there, you must bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the contributions of your hand, and all your choice vowed offerings that you vow to the Lord.
12 You will rejoice before the Lord your God—you, your sons, your daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your towns, since he has no portion or inheritance with you.


13 Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see,
14 but only at the place the Lord will choose in one of your tribes. There you must offer your burnt offerings and do everything I command you.
15 However, whenever you desire, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your towns, according to the blessing the Lord your God has given you. Both the unclean and the clean may eat it, as they would the gazelle or the deer.
16 Only you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
17 You are not permitted to eat within your towns the tithe of your grain, new wine, or oil, or the firstborn of your herds or flocks, or any of your vowed offerings that you vow, or your freewill offerings, or the contributions of your hand.
18 Instead, you must eat them before the Lord your God at the place the Lord your God will choose—you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your towns—and you will rejoice before the Lord your God in all the work of your hands.
19 Be careful not to neglect the Levite as long as you live in your land.


20 When the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he has promised you, and you say, “I want to eat meat,” because you crave meat, then you may eat meat whenever you desire.
21 If the place where the Lord your God chooses to put his name is too far from you, then you may slaughter animals from your herds and flocks that the Lord has given you, as I have commanded you, and you may eat within your towns whenever you desire.
22 Just as the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so you may eat it; the unclean and the clean alike may eat it.
23 Only be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat.
24 Do not eat it; pour it out on the ground like water.
25 Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the sight of the Lord.


26 But the holy things that belong to you and your vowed offerings you must take and go to the place that the Lord will choose.
27 Present your burnt offerings—the meat and the blood—on the altar of the Lord your God; the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the Lord your God, but the meat you may eat.
28 Be careful to obey all these words that I command you, so that it may go well with you and your children after you forever, because you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the Lord your God.


29 When the Lord your God cuts off the nations before you, where you are going to dispossess them, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land,
30 be careful not to be ensnared by following them, after they have been destroyed before you, and do not inquire about their gods, saying, “How did these nations serve their gods? I will do the same.”
31 You must not worship the Lord your God in that way, for every abominable thing that the Lord hates they have done for their gods, even burning their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods.


32 Everything that I command you, you must be careful to do; you shall not add to it or take away from it.




Chapter 13


1 If a prophet or someone who interprets dreams arises among you and promises you a sign or wonder,
2 and that sign or wonder they spoke about actually happens, and then they say, "Let’s follow other gods" (gods you’ve never known) "and worship them,"
3 you must not listen to what that prophet or dream-interpreter says. The Lord your God is testing you to find out whether you truly love Him with all your heart and all your soul.
4 You are to follow the Lord your God and revere Him. Keep His commands and obey His voice; serve Him and stay loyal to Him.
5 That prophet or dream-interpreter must be put to death because they’ve preached rebellion against the Lord your God—who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from slavery—to pull you away from the path the Lord your God commanded you to walk. You must purge this evil from among you.


6 If your own brother (your mother’s son), or your son, daughter, the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly tries to convince you, saying, "Let’s go worship other gods" (gods neither you nor your ancestors have known,
7 gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the earth to the other),
8 do not give in to them or listen to them. Don’t let your eye spare them; don’t show pity or shield them.
9 You must surely kill them. Your hand must be the first to strike them down, followed by the hands of all the people.
10 Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
11 Then all Israel will hear about it and be afraid, and no one will dare to do such an evil thing among you again.


12 If you hear a report about one of your towns that the Lord your God is giving you to live in, saying,
13 "Some wicked people have come out from among you and have led the town’s residents astray, saying, ‘Let’s go worship other gods,’" (gods you’ve never known)
14 then you must investigate thoroughly and carefully. If it’s true and confirmed that such a detestable thing has happened among you,
15 you must absolutely strike down the inhabitants of that town with the sword. Devote it and everything in it—including its livestock—to total destruction.
16 Gather all its plunder into the middle of the town square and burn the town completely, along with all its goods, as a whole burnt offering to the Lord your God. It will remain a ruin forever, never to be rebuilt.
17 Don’t let any of the devoted things stick to your hands, so that the Lord may turn from His fierce anger, show you mercy, have compassion on you, and multiply you, just as He swore to your ancestors—
18 but only if you obey the Lord your God, keeping all His commands that I’m giving you today and doing what is right in the sight of the Lord your God.




Chapter 14


1 You are the children of the Lord your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave the front of your heads for the sake of the dead,
2 because you are a people holy to the Lord your God. Out of all the peoples on the face of the earth, the Lord has chosen you to be His treasured possession.


3 Do not eat anything detestable.
4 These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,
5 the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain sheep.
6 You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof split into two parts and that chews the cud.
7 However, of those that chew the cud or have a divided hoof, you may not eat the camel, the rabbit, or the rock hyrax. Although they chew the cud, they do not have a divided hoof; they are unclean for you.
8 The pig is also unclean for you; though it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses.


9 Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat any that have fins and scales.
10 But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat; it is unclean for you.


11 You may eat any clean bird.
12 But these are the ones you may not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,
13 the red kite, the black kite, any kind of falcon,
14 any kind of raven,
15 the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk,
16 the little owl, the great owl, the white owl,
17 the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant,
18 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.


19 All winged insects are unclean for you; do not eat them.
20 But any clean winged creature you may eat.


21 Do not eat anything you find already dead. You may give it to the foreigner residing in your towns, and they may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. But you are a people holy to the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.


22 Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year.
23 Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine, and olive oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the Lord your God at the place He will choose as a dwelling for His Name, so that you may learn to revere the Lord your God always.
24 But if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the Lord your God and cannot carry your tithe because the place where the Lord will choose to put His Name is too far away,
25 then exchange your tithe for silver, and take the silver with you and go to the place the Lord your God will choose.
26 Use the silver to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine, or other fermented drink, or anything you wish. Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the Lord your God and rejoice.
27 And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns, for they have no allotment or inheritance of their own.


28 At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year’s produce and store it in your towns,
29 so that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their own) and the foreigners, the fatherless, and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.


Chapter 15


1 Every seven years, you must cancel debts.
2 This is how it works: every creditor must release what they have loaned to their neighbor. They must not press their neighbor or fellow Israelite for payment, because the Lord’s time for canceling debts has been announced.
3 You may press a foreigner for payment, but whatever you have lent to your fellow Israelite, you must release.
4 However, there should be no poor among you, because the Lord will richly bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess—
5 if only you fully obey the Lord your God and carefully follow all these commands I am giving you today.
6 For the Lord your God will bless you as He has promised: you will lend to many nations but borrow from none; you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.


7 If there is a poor person among you—one of your fellow Israelites in any of your towns in the land the Lord your God is giving you—do not harden your heart or close your hand against them.
8 Instead, open your hand generously and lend them whatever they need.
9 Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: “The seventh year, the year of debt cancellation, is near,” and then look stingily at your poor fellow Israelite and give them nothing. They might cry out to the Lord against you, and you would be guilty of sin.
10 Give to them generously and without a grudging heart, because for this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you undertake.
11 There will always be poor people in the land, so I command you to be open-handed toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land.


12 If a fellow Hebrew, whether a man or a woman, sells themselves to you, they will serve you for six years. In the seventh year, you must set them free.
13 When you release them, do not send them away empty-handed.
14 Provide for them generously from your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress; give to them as the Lord your God has blessed you.
15 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and the Lord your God redeemed you; that is why I am giving you this command today.
16 But if your servant says to you, “I don’t want to leave you,” because they love you and your household and are well off with you,
17 then take an awl and pierce it through their ear into the door, and they will become your servant for life. Do the same for a female servant.
18 Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you for six years was worth twice as much as a hired worker. Then the Lord your God will bless you in all you do.


19 Set apart for the Lord your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your cattle to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep.
20 Each year, you and your household are to eat them in the presence of the Lord your God at the place He will choose.
21 If an animal has a defect—is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw—you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.
22 You may eat it within your towns; both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as they would a gazelle or deer.
23 But you must not eat its blood; pour it out on the ground like water.




Chapter 16


1 Observe the month of Aviv and celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, because it was in the month of Aviv that the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt at night.
2 You must sacrifice the Passover offering to the Lord your God from the flock or the herd in the place where the Lord chooses to establish his name.
3 Do not eat it with anything leavened; for seven days, eat unleavened bread with it—the bread of affliction—since you left the land of Egypt in a hurry. This will help you remember the day you came out of Egypt all the days of your life.
4 No leaven should be seen among you in all your territory for seven days, and none of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day should remain until morning.
5 You are not allowed to sacrifice the Passover offering within any of your towns that the Lord your God gives you;
6 rather, it must be sacrificed at the place where the Lord your God chooses to establish his name. There you shall offer the Passover sacrifice in the evening, at sunset, the time when you came out of Egypt.
7 Cook it and eat it in the place the Lord your God chooses, then in the morning you may return to your tents.
8 For six days you must eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day hold a solemn assembly to the Lord your God; do no work on it.


9 Count off seven weeks for yourself; begin counting the seven weeks from the time you first put the sickle to the standing grain.
10 Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the Lord your God with a freewill offering in proportion to how the Lord your God has blessed you.
11 Rejoice before the Lord your God—you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, the Levite within your towns, the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow among you—at the place where the Lord your God chooses to establish his name.
12 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and carefully follow these statutes.


13 Celebrate the Festival of Booths for seven days after you have gathered the produce from your threshing floor and your winepress.
14 Rejoice during your festival—you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, the Levite, the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow within your towns.
15 For seven days, keep the festival to the Lord your God at the place the Lord chooses, because the Lord your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and you will be filled with joy.
16 Three times a year all your males must appear before the Lord your God at the place he chooses: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths. They must not appear before the Lord empty-handed;
17 each man should give according to what he has, in proportion to the blessing the Lord your God has given you.


18 Appoint judges and officials for yourself in all your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, according to your tribes, and they must judge the people with righteous judgment.
19 Do not pervert justice, show partiality, or accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous.
20 Pursue justice and only justice, so that you may live and possess the land the Lord your God is giving you.


21 Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole beside the altar of the Lord your God that you make for yourself,
22 nor erect a sacred stone pillar, which the Lord your God hates.




Chapter 17


1 You must not sacrifice to the Lord your God an ox or a sheep that has any defect or serious flaw, because that is detestable to the Lord your God.


2 If a man or woman is found among you, in one of the towns the Lord your God is giving you, who does what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God by violating His covenant,
3 and they go and serve other gods and bow down to them—or to the sun, the moon, or any of the heavenly bodies, which I have forbidden—
4 and you are told about it, then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is confirmed and proven true that such a detestable thing has been done in Israel,
5 then you must bring that man or woman who has done this wicked thing out to your city gates—that man or that woman—and stone them to death.
6 On the testimony of two or three witnesses, the one who is to die must be put to death; they must not be executed on the testimony of a single witness.
7 The hands of the witnesses must be the first to stone them, and then the hands of all the people afterward. In this way, you will purge the evil from among you.


8 If a case arises in one of your towns that is too difficult for you to judge—whether it involves a homicide, a legal dispute, or an assault—and it is a matter of contention, then you must go up to the place the Lord your God will choose.
9 You shall approach the Levitical priests and the judge who is in office at that time, and you shall inquire of them, and they will give you the legal decision.
10 You must act according to the decision they give you from that place the Lord will choose, and you must be careful to do everything they instruct you.
11 You must follow the legal ruling they provide and the verdict they declare to you without turning aside to the right or to the left from what they tell you.
12 But if a man acts presumptuously and refuses to listen to the priest who stands there to serve the Lord your God, or to the judge, that man must die. So you will purge the evil from Israel.
13 Then all the people will hear about it and be afraid, and they will no longer act presumptuously.


14 When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you and take possession of it and settle in it, and you say, “I will appoint a king over me like all the nations around me,”
15 you may indeed appoint a king over you whom the Lord your God will choose. He must be one of your own brothers; you must not place a foreigner over you who is not your brother.
16 However, he must not acquire many horses for himself or send the people back to Egypt to acquire more horses, for the Lord has said to you, “You must never return that way again.”
17 He must not take many wives for himself, so that his heart does not turn away, nor must he amass great amounts of silver and gold for himself.
18 When he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he must write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests.
19 It must remain with him, and he must read it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the Lord his God by keeping all the words of this law and these statutes and doing them.
20 This will ensure that his heart does not become arrogant above his brothers and that he does not turn aside from the commandment to the right or to the left, so that he and his sons may reign long over his kingdom in Israel.




Chapter 18


1 The Levitical priests, that is, the entire tribe of Levi, will not have a share or inheritance with the rest of Israel. Instead, they will eat the offerings made by fire to the Lord, which are their inheritance.
2 They will not possess any land among their fellow Israelites; the Lord himself is their inheritance, just as he promised them.


3 This is the portion due to the priests from the people—those who offer a sacrifice, whether it’s an ox or a sheep: they must give the priest the shoulder, the jowls, and the stomach.
4 You must also give them the first portion of your grain, new wine, and olive oil, as well as the first fleece from your sheep.
5 For the Lord your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and serve in the Lord’s name forever.


6 If a Levite decides to leave one of your towns, wherever he has been living in Israel, and comes to the place the Lord will choose, out of his own desire,
7 he may serve in the name of the Lord his God just like all his fellow Levites who stand there before the Lord.
8 He is entitled to an equal share of the provisions, regardless of any income he might have from selling family property.


9 When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not imitate the detestable practices of the nations there.
10 No one among you should ever sacrifice their son or daughter in the fire, practice divination, interpret omens, engage in witchcraft,
11 cast spells, consult a medium or spiritist, or attempt to summon the dead.
12 Anyone who does these things is abhorrent to the Lord, and it’s because of these detestable practices that the Lord your God is driving those nations out before you.
13 You must be blameless before the Lord your God.


14 Although these nations you’re about to displace listen to fortune-tellers and diviners, the Lord your God has not permitted you to do the same.
15 Instead, the Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people—you must listen to him.
16 This is exactly what you asked for from the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the Lord our God again or see this great fire anymore, or we will die.”


17 The Lord said to me, “What they’ve said is good.
18 I will raise up a prophet for them from among their own people, like you, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will speak to them everything I command him.
19 If anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will hold them accountable.
20 But if a prophet presumes to speak a message in my name that I haven’t commanded, or speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet must die.”


21 You might wonder, “How can we know if a message hasn’t been spoken by the Lord?”
22 If a prophet speaks in the Lord’s name and the prediction doesn’t come true or happen, that’s a message the Lord didn’t speak. The prophet has spoken arrogantly, and you don’t need to fear him.




Chapter 19


1 When the Lord your God cuts off the nations whose land the Lord your God is giving you, and you dispossess them and settle in their cities and in their houses, 2 you shall set apart three cities for yourself in the midst of your land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess. 3 You shall prepare the roads for yourself and divide into three parts the territory of your land that the Lord your God causes you to inherit, so that any manslayer may flee there.


4 This is the instruction for the manslayer who flees there and lives: whoever strikes his neighbor unintentionally, not hating him from before— 5 for example, a man who goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to fell a tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies—he may flee to one of these cities and live, 6 lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer while his heart is hot and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him fatally, though he did not deserve death since he did not hate him from before. 7 Therefore, I command you, saying, “You shall set apart three cities for yourself.”


8 If the Lord your God enlarges your border as He swore to your fathers and gives you all the land that He spoke to give to your fathers— 9 if you keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you today, to love the Lord your God and to walk in His ways always—then you shall add three more cities for yourself besides these three, 10 so that innocent blood may not be shed in the midst of your land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, and bloodguilt be upon you.


11 But if a man hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and rises against him and strikes him fatally so that he dies, and he flees to one of these cities, 12 then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, so that he may die. 13 Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, so that it may go well with you.


14 You shall not move your neighbor’s boundary marker, which the men of old set, in your inheritance that you will inherit in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess.


15 A single witness shall not stand against a man for any iniquity or for any sin, in any sin that he commits; by the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses a matter shall be established. 16 If a malicious witness rises against a man to accuse him of wrongdoing, 17 then both men who have the dispute shall stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges who are in office in those days. 18 The judges shall inquire diligently, and if the witness is a false witness and has testified falsely against his brother, 19 then you shall do to him as he intended to do to his brother. So you shall purge the evil from your midst. 20 Those who remain shall hear and fear and shall not again commit such evil in your midst. 21 Your eye shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.




Chapter 20


1 When you go out to war against your enemies and see horses, chariots, and an army larger than yours, do not be afraid of them, for the Lord your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt, is with you. 2 When you draw near to the battle, the priest shall approach and speak to the men. 3 He shall say to them, "Hear, O Israel, today you are drawing near to battle against your enemies. Do not let your heart faint. Do not fear or panic or be terrified because of them, 4 for the Lord your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you victory."


5 Then the officers shall speak to the men, saying, "What man is there who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it. 6 And what man is there who has planted a vineyard and has not enjoyed its fruit? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man enjoy its fruit. 7 And what man is there who has betrothed a wife and has not taken her? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man take her." 8 The officers shall speak further to the men and say, "What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go back to his house, lest he make the heart of his brothers faint like his own." 9 When the officers have finished speaking to the men, they shall appoint commanders of the armies to lead the men.


10 When you draw near to a city to fight against it, offer it terms of peace. 11 If it accepts your terms of peace and opens its gates to you, then all the men found in it shall become forced laborers for you and serve you. 12 But if it does not make peace with you and makes war against you, then you shall besiege it. 13 When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male in it with the edge of the sword. 14 However, the women, the children, the livestock, and all that is in the city—all its spoil—you shall take as plunder for yourselves. You shall enjoy the spoil of your enemies, which the Lord your God has given you. 15 Thus you shall do to all the cities that are very far from you, which are not cities of the nations here.


16 But in the cities of these nations that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, you shall not leave alive anything that breathes. 17 You shall devote them to complete destruction—the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites—as the Lord your God has commanded you, 18 so that they may not teach you to do according to all their abominations that they have done for their gods, and so you sin against the Lord your God.


19 When you besiege a city for a long time, making war against it to capture it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them. You may eat from them, but you shall not cut them down. For is the tree of the field a man, that it should be besieged by you? 20 However, the trees that you know are not trees for food, you may destroy and cut down to build siegeworks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.




Chapter 21


1 If a man is found slain in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess, lying in the field, and it is not known who struck him,
2 then your elders and your judges shall go out and measure the distance to the cities that are around the slain man.
3 And the elders of the city that is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer that has never been worked and has not pulled in a yoke.
4 The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and there they shall break the heifer’s neck in the valley.
5 Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister to Him and to bless in the name of the Lord, and by their word every dispute and every assault shall be settled.
6 All the elders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,
7 and they shall declare, “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done.
8 Accept atonement, O Lord, for Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed, and do not set the guilt of innocent blood in the midst of Your people Israel.” Then the bloodguilt shall be atoned for them.
9 So you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst, when you do what is right in the sight of the Lord.


10 When you go out to war against your enemies, and the Lord your God gives them into your hand, and you take them captive,
11 and you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you desire her and would take her as a wife for yourself,
12 then you shall bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head and trim her nails.
13 She shall remove the clothes of her captivity and remain in your house and mourn her father and her mother for a full month. After that, you may go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
14 But if you no longer delight in her, then you shall let her go where she wishes. You shall not sell her for money, nor shall you treat her as a slave, because you have humbled her.


15 If a man has two wives, one loved and the other unloved, and both the loved and the unloved have borne him sons, and if the firstborn son belongs to the unloved,
16 then on the day when he assigns his possessions as an inheritance to his sons, he may not treat the son of the loved as the firstborn in preference to the son of the unloved, who is the firstborn.
17 But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the unloved, by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the beginning of his strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him.


18 If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they discipline him, he will not listen to them,
19 then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of that place.
20 They shall say to the elders of his city, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.”
21 Then all the men of his city shall stone him with stones until he dies. So you shall purge the evil from your midst, and all Israel shall hear and fear.


22 If a man has committed a sin deserving of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree,
23 his body shall not remain on the tree overnight, but you shall bury him that same day, for a hanged man is cursed by God. You shall not defile your land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.




Chapter 22


1 If you see your brother’s ox or sheep wandering off, don’t ignore it—you must take it back to him.
2 If your brother isn’t nearby, or you don’t know who owns it, take it home with you and keep it until he comes looking for it, then give it back to him.
3 Do the same with his donkey, his clothing, or anything else your brother loses that you find—you can’t just pretend you didn’t see it.
4 If you see your brother’s donkey or ox collapsed on the road, don’t look the other way—help him get it back on its feet.


5 A woman must not wear a man’s clothing, nor a man put on a woman’s garment, because anyone who does this is detestable to the Lord your God.


6 If you come across a bird’s nest along the way, in a tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs and the mother sitting on them, don’t take the mother along with the young.
7 Let the mother go, but you can take the young for yourself—this way it’ll go well with you, and you’ll live a long life.


8 When you build a new house, make a railing around your roof so you don’t bring bloodguilt on your house if someone falls from it.


9 Don’t plant two kinds of seed in your vineyard—otherwise, the whole crop, both what you planted and what the vineyard produces, will be forfeited.
10 Don’t plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.
11 Don’t wear clothing woven from wool and linen mixed together.


12 Make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.


13 If a man marries a woman, goes to her, and then hates her,
14 and he accuses her of shameful things, spreads a bad name about her, and says, “I married this woman, but when I approached her, I didn’t find her a virgin,”
15 then the girl’s father and mother must take the evidence of her virginity and bring it to the elders at the city gate.
16 The girl’s father will say to the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man as a wife, but he hates her.
17 Now he’s making up accusations, saying, ‘I didn’t find your daughter a virgin.’ But here’s the evidence of my daughter’s virginity.” And they’ll spread out the cloth before the elders of the city.
18 The elders of that city will take the man, punish him,
19 and fine him a hundred shekels of silver, which he’ll pay to the girl’s father because he defamed a virgin of Israel. She’ll remain his wife—he can’t divorce her as long as he lives.
20 But if the accusation is true, and no evidence of the girl’s virginity is found,
21 they’ll bring the girl to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city will stone her to death with stones, because she did a disgraceful thing in Israel by playing the harlot in her father’s house. So you’ll purge the evil from among you.


22 If a man is found lying with a married woman, both of them must die—the man who lay with her and the woman. So you’ll purge the evil from Israel.


23 If there’s a virgin girl engaged to a man, and another man finds her in the city and lies with her,
24 you’ll bring them both out to the gate of that city and stone them to death with stones—the girl because she didn’t cry out, though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbor’s wife. So you’ll purge the evil from among you.
25 But if the man finds the engaged girl in the countryside, seizes her, and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her must die.
26 Don’t do anything to the girl—she’s not guilty of a crime deserving death. This case is like when a man attacks his neighbor and murders him.
27 Since he found her in the countryside, the engaged girl may have cried out, but there was no one to rescue her.


28 If a man finds a virgin girl who isn’t engaged, seizes her, lies with her, and they’re discovered,
29 the man who lay with her must give the girl’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she’ll become his wife because he violated her. He can’t divorce her as long as he lives.


30 A man must not take his father’s wife or uncover his father’s skirt.




Chapter 23


1 A man whose testicles are crushed or whose penis is cut off shall not enter the assembly of the Lord.
2 A man born of an illegitimate union shall not enter the assembly of the Lord; even to the tenth generation, none of his descendants shall enter the assembly of the Lord.
3 An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter the assembly of the Lord; even to the tenth generation, none of their descendants shall enter the assembly of the Lord, forever,
4 because they did not meet you with bread and water on the way when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired Balaam, son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, against you to curse you.
5 But the Lord your God would not listen to Balaam; instead, the Lord your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the Lord your God loved you.
6 You shall not seek their peace or their prosperity all your days forever.


7 You shall not detest an Edomite, for he is your brother. You shall not detest an Egyptian, because you were a sojourner in his land.
8 The sons of the third generation who are born to them may enter the assembly of the Lord.


9 When you go out as a camp against your enemies, you shall keep yourself from every evil thing.
10 If there is among you a man who is not clean because of a nocturnal emission, he shall go outside the camp; he shall not come inside the camp.
11 But when evening comes, he shall bathe himself in water, and at sunset he may come back into the camp.
12 You shall have a designated place outside the camp where you shall go to relieve yourself.
13 And you shall have a trowel among your equipment, and when you sit down outside, you shall dig with it and turn back and cover your excrement,
14 because the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp to deliver you and to give your enemies over to you. Therefore, your camp must be holy, so that He does not see anything indecent among you and turn away from you.


15 You shall not hand over to his master a slave who has escaped to you from his master.
16 He shall dwell with you in your midst, in the place that he chooses within one of your towns, wherever it suits him. You shall not oppress him.


17 There shall be no cult prostitute among the daughters of Israel, nor shall there be a cult prostitute among the sons of Israel.
18 You shall not bring the fee of a prostitute or the wages of a male prostitute into the house of the Lord your God for any vow, for both of these are an abomination to the Lord your God.


19 You shall not charge interest to your brother—interest on money, interest on food, interest on anything that is lent for interest.
20 To a foreigner you may charge interest, but to your brother you shall not charge interest, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to in the land that you are entering to possess.


21 When you make a vow to the Lord your God, you shall not delay to fulfill it, for the Lord your God will surely require it of you, and it would be sin in you.
22 But if you refrain from vowing, it shall not be sin in you.
23 What has gone out of your lips you shall keep and perform, just as you vowed to the Lord your God as a freewill offering, which you have promised with your mouth.


24 When you go into your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat grapes until you are satisfied, but you shall not put any in your container.
25 When you go into your neighbor’s standing grain, you may pluck the ears with your hand, but you shall not wield a sickle against your neighbor’s standing grain.




Chapter 24


1 If a man marries a woman and then finds something indecent about her, and she no longer pleases him, he may write her a certificate of divorce, hand it to her, and send her out of his house.
2 After she leaves his house, she may go and marry another man.
3 If the second husband also dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce, hands it to her, and sends her out of his house—or if he dies—
4 then her first husband, who divorced her, is not allowed to marry her again, since she has been defiled. That would be an abomination before the Lord. You must not bring sin upon the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.


5 When a man has recently married, he must not be sent to war or have any other duty imposed on him. For one year he is to be free to stay at home and bring happiness to the wife he has married.


6 Do not take a pair of millstones—or even the upper one—as a pledge, for that would be taking a man’s livelihood as a pledge.


7 If a man is caught kidnapping one of his fellow Israelites and treating him as a slave or selling him, that kidnapper must die. You must purge the evil from among you.


8 In cases of a defiling skin disease, be careful to follow exactly the instructions of the Levitical priests, who will teach you what I commanded them.
9 Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam along the way after you came out of Egypt.


10 When you make a loan of any kind to your neighbor, do not go into his house to get what he is offering as a pledge.
11 Stand outside, and let the man to whom you are making the loan bring the pledge out to you.
12 If he is a poor man, do not keep his pledge overnight.
13 Return his cloak to him by sunset so that he may sleep in it. Then he will bless you, and it will be an act of righteousness before the Lord your God.


14 Do not oppress a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether he is a fellow Israelite or a foreigner residing in one of your towns.
15 Pay him his wages each day before sunset, because he is poor and depends on them. Otherwise, he may cry out to the Lord against you, and you will be guilty of sin.


16 Fathers must not be put to death for their sons, nor sons for their fathers; each man is to die for his own sin.


17 Do not deny justice to a foreigner or an orphan, and do not take a widow’s cloak as a pledge.
18 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt and that the Lord your God redeemed you from there. That is why I command you to do this.


19 When you harvest your field and forget a sheaf there, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
20 When you beat the olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow.
21 When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, do not go over it again. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow.
22 Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt. That is why I command you to do this.




Chapter 25


1 If there is a dispute between men and they go to court, and the judges decide their case, they shall justify the righteous man and condemn the wicked man.
2 Then it shall be, if the wicked man deserves to be beaten, the judge shall make him lie down and be beaten in his presence with the number of stripes according to his guilt.
3 He may strike him forty times, but no more, lest he strike him with many more stripes than these and your brother be degraded in your eyes.


4 You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.


5 If brothers dwell together and one of them dies and has no son, the wife of the dead man shall not be married outside the family to a strange man. Her husband’s brother shall go in to her and take her as his wife and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her.
6 And the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed to the name of his dead brother, so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel.
7 But if the man does not desire to take his brother’s wife, then his brother’s wife shall go up to the gate to the elders and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to raise up a name for his brother in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband’s brother to me.”
8 Then the elders of his city shall summon him and speak to him. And if he persists and says, “I do not desire to take her,”
9 then his brother’s wife shall come to him in the sight of the elders and pull his sandal off his foot and spit in his face. And she shall declare, “Thus it is done to the man who does not build up his brother’s house.”
10 And in Israel his name shall be called, “The house of him whose sandal was removed.”


11 If two men, a man and his countryman, are struggling together, and the wife of one comes near to deliver her husband from the hand of the one striking him, and puts out her hand and seizes his genitals,
12 then you shall cut off her hand; your eye shall not pity her.


13 You shall not have in your bag differing weights, a large and a small.
14 You shall not have in your house differing measures, a large and a small.
15 You shall have a full and just weight; you shall have a full and just measure, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God gives you.
16 For everyone who does these things, everyone who acts unjustly, is an abomination to the Lord your God.


17 Remember what Amalek did to you along the way when you came out from Egypt,
18 how he met you along the way and attacked among you all the stragglers at your rear when you were faint and weary; and he did not fear God.
19 Therefore it shall come about, when the Lord your God has given you rest from all your surrounding enemies in the land which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance to possess, you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven; you shall not forget.




Chapter 26


1 "And it shall be, when you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, and you take possession of it and dwell in it,
2 that you shall take some of the first of all the produce of the ground that you harvest from the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place that the Lord your God chooses to make His name dwell there.
3 And you shall go to the priest who is in office in those days and say to him, ‘I declare today to the Lord your God that I have entered the land that the Lord swore to our fathers to give us.’


4 Then the priest shall take the basket from your hand and set it down before the altar of the Lord your God.
5 And you shall declare before the Lord your God: ‘My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down to Egypt and sojourned there, few in number. But there he became a great, mighty, and numerous nation.
6 And the Egyptians mistreated us, afflicted us, and imposed hard labor upon us.
7 Then we cried out to the Lord, the God of our fathers, and the Lord heard our voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression.
8 And the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror, with signs and wonders.
9 And He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
10 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land that You, O Lord, have given me.’


Then you shall set it down before the Lord your God and worship before the Lord your God.
11 And you shall rejoice in all the good that the Lord your God has given to you and to your house—you, the Levite, and the sojourner who is among you.


12 When you finish tithing the tenth of your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you shall give it to the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within your towns and be satisfied.
13 Then you shall declare before the Lord your God: ‘I have removed from my house the sacred portion, and I have also given it to the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all Your commandment that You have commanded me. I have not transgressed or forgotten Your commandments.
14 I have not eaten of it while in mourning, nor have I removed any of it while unclean, nor have I given any of it as a sacrifice to the dead. I have obeyed the voice of the Lord my God; I have done according to all that You have commanded me.
15 Look down from Your holy dwelling place, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel and the land that You have given us, as You swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.’


16 This day the Lord your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances; therefore, you shall be careful to do them with all your heart and with all your soul.
17 Today you have declared that the Lord is your God and that you will walk in His ways, keep His statutes, His commandments, and His ordinances, and obey His voice.
18 And today the Lord has declared that you are His treasured people, as He promised you, and that you are to keep all His commandments,
19 so that He may set you high above all the nations He has made, in praise, in fame, and in honor, and that you shall be a holy people to the Lord your God, as He has spoken."




Chapter 27


1 Then Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, “Keep every commandment that I am giving you today.
2 On the day when you cross the Jordan into the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you shall set up large stones for yourself and coat them with plaster.
3 You shall write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over, so that you may enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has promised you.


4 So when you have crossed the Jordan, you shall set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I am commanding you today, and coat them with plaster.
5 There you shall build an altar to the Lord your God, an altar of stones. You shall not use an iron tool on them.
6 You shall build the altar of the Lord your God with uncut stones, and you shall offer burnt offerings on it to the Lord your God.
7 You shall sacrifice peace offerings and eat there, rejoicing before the Lord your God.
8 You shall write clearly on the stones all the words of this law.”


9 Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying, “Be silent and listen, O Israel! Today you have become the people of the Lord your God.
10 Therefore, you shall obey the voice of the Lord your God and keep His commandments and His statutes that I am commanding you today.”


11 That day, Moses commanded the people, saying,
12 “When you have crossed the Jordan, these shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
13 And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.


14 Then the Levites shall speak and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice:


15 ‘Cursed is the man who makes a carved or cast image, an abomination to the Lord, the work of a craftsman’s hands, and sets it up in secret.’ And all the people shall answer and say, ‘Amen.’


16 ‘Cursed is he who dishonors his father or his mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’


17 ‘Cursed is he who moves his neighbor’s boundary marker.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’


18 ‘Cursed is he who leads a blind man astray on the road.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’


19 ‘Cursed is he who perverts justice due to foreigners, the fatherless, or widows.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’


20 ‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his father’s wife, for he has uncovered his father’s bed.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’


21 ‘Cursed is he who lies with any animal.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’


22 ‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his sister, whether the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’


23 ‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his mother-in-law.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’


24 ‘Cursed is he who strikes down his neighbor in secret.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’


25 ‘Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’


26 ‘Cursed is he who does not uphold the words of this law by doing them.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’




Chapter 28


1 And it shall come to pass, if you diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God, being careful to do all His commandments that I command you today, then the Lord your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.
2 And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, if you obey the voice of the Lord your God.


3 Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field.


4 Blessed shall be the fruit of your womb, the produce of your ground, and the offspring of your livestock—the increase of your herds and the young of your flock.


5 Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.


6 Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.


7 The Lord will cause your enemies who rise against you to be defeated before you. They shall come out against you one way and flee before you seven ways.
8 The Lord will command the blessing on you in your barns and in all that you undertake, and He will bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.  


9 The Lord will establish you as a holy people to Himself, as He has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of the Lord your God and walk in His ways.
10 And all the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the Lord, and they shall fear you.
11 And the Lord will make you abound in prosperity, in the fruit of your womb, in the offspring of your livestock, and in the produce of your ground, in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers to give you.
12 The Lord will open to you His good treasury, the heavens, to give rain to your land in its season and to bless all the work of your hands. And you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow.
13 And the Lord will make you the head and not the tail, and you shall only go up and not down, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I command you today, being careful to do them.
14 And you shall not turn aside from any of the words that I command you today, to the right or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.  


15 But if you will not obey the voice of the Lord your God, being careful to do all His commandments and His statutes that I command you today, then all these curses shall come upon you and overtake you.


16 Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field.


17 Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.


18 Cursed shall be the fruit of your womb, the produce of your ground, the increase of your herds, and the young of your flock.


19 Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.


20 The Lord will send on you curses, confusion, and frustration in all that you undertake to do, until you are destroyed and perish quickly because of the evil of your deeds, because you have forsaken Me.
21 The Lord will make the plague cling to you until He has consumed you from the land that you are entering to take possession of it.
22 The Lord will strike you with wasting disease, with fever, with inflammation, with fiery heat, with drought, with blight, and with mildew. They shall pursue you until you perish.
23 And the heavens over your head shall be bronze, and the earth under you shall be iron.
24 The Lord will turn the rain of your land into powder and dust; from heaven it shall come down on you until you are destroyed.
25 The Lord will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You shall go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them. And you shall be a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
26 And your dead body shall be food for all the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth, and there shall be no one to frighten them away.


27 The Lord will strike you with the boils of Egypt, with tumors, scabs, and itch, from which you cannot be healed.
28 The Lord will strike you with madness, blindness, and confusion of heart.
29 And you shall grope at noonday as the blind grope in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways. And you shall be only oppressed and robbed continually, and there shall be no one to save you.


30 You shall betroth a wife, but another man shall lie with her. You shall build a house, but you shall not live in it. You shall plant a vineyard, but you shall not enjoy its fruit.
31 Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, but you shall not eat any of it. Your donkey shall be stolen before you, but it shall not be restored to you. Your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have no one to save you.
32 Your sons and daughters shall be given to another people, and your eyes shall look on and fail with longing for them all day long, but you shall be helpless.
33 A nation that you do not know shall eat up the fruit of your ground and all your labors, and you shall be only oppressed and crushed continually,
34 so that you are driven mad by the sights that your eyes see.
35 The Lord will strike you on the knees and on the legs with grievous boils of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.


36 The Lord will bring you and your king, whom you set over you, to a nation that neither you nor your fathers have known. And there you shall serve other gods of wood and stone.
37 And you shall become a horror, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples where the Lord will lead you away.


38 You shall carry much seed into the field but shall gather little in, for the locust shall consume it.
39 You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes, for the worm shall eat them.
40 You shall have olive trees throughout all your territory, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil, for your olives shall drop off.
41 You shall father sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours, for they shall go into captivity.




Chapter 29


1 These are the words of the covenant that the Lord commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He had made with them at Horeb.  


2 And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “You have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land,
3 the great trials which your eyes saw, those great signs and wonders.
4 Yet to this day, the Lord has not given you a heart to understand, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear.  


5 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness; your clothes have not worn out upon you, and your sandals have not worn out on your feet.
6 You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink, so that you might know that I am the Lord your God.  


7 And when you came to this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to meet us in battle, and we defeated them.
8 And we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.  


9 So keep the words of this covenant and do them, so that you may prosper in all that you do.  


10 You stand today, all of you, before the Lord your God: your chiefs, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, all the men of Israel,
11 your little ones, your wives, and the sojourner who is in your camp, from the one who chops your wood to the one who draws your water,
12 so that you may enter into the covenant of the Lord your God and into His oath, which the Lord your God is making with you today,
13 in order that He may establish you as His people and that He may be your God, as He promised you and as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.  


14 Now, it is not with you alone that I am making this covenant and this oath,
15 but with those who stand here with us today before the Lord our God, and also with those who are not here with us today.  


16 For you know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we passed through the midst of the nations through which you passed.
17 And you saw their detestable things and their idols of wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them.  


18 Beware lest there be among you a man or a woman or a family or a tribe whose heart turns away today from the Lord our God to go and serve the gods of those nations; lest there be among you a root bearing poison and wormwood.
19 And it will be, when he hears the words of this oath, that he blesses himself in his heart, saying, ‘I will have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,’ so that the watered land may be swept away along with the dry.  


20 The Lord will not be willing to forgive him, but rather, the anger of the Lord and His jealousy will burn against that man, and every curse that is written in this book will rest upon him, and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven.
21 And the Lord will single him out for disaster from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Law.  


22 And the coming generation, your sons who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, will see the plagues of that land and the diseases with which the Lord has struck it.
23 The whole land will be a burning waste of brimstone and salt, without being sown, without sprouting, and without any vegetation growing in it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the Lord overthrew in His anger and in His wrath.  


24 And all the nations will say, ‘Why has the Lord made the land like this? What caused this great burning of anger?’
25 Then they will say, ‘Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt,
26 and they went and served other gods and bowed down to them—gods whom they had not known and whom He had not asked them to serve.
27 Therefore, the anger of the Lord burned against this land, to bring upon it every curse that is written in this book.
28 And the Lord uprooted them from their land in anger and wrath and great fury, and He cast them into another land, as it is this day.’  


29 The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may do all the words of this Law.”




Chapter 30


1 When all these things come upon you—the blessing and the curse that I have set before you—and you call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you,
2 and you return to the Lord your God and obey His voice with all your heart and all your soul, according to all that I command you today, you and your sons,
3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you. He will gather you again from all the peoples where He scattered you.
4 Even if you are driven to the ends of the heavens, the Lord your God will gather you from there, and He will bring you back from there.
5 The Lord your God will bring you into the land that your fathers possessed, and you will take possession of it. He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers.


6 The Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your children, so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.
7 The Lord your God will put all these curses upon your enemies and upon those who hate you and persecuted you.
8 And you shall return and obey the voice of the Lord and do all His commandments that I command you today.
9 The Lord your God will make you abundantly prosperous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your womb, in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your land. For the Lord will again delight in prospering you, as He delighted in your fathers,
10 if you obey the voice of the Lord your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes that are written in this Book of the Law, and if you turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul.  


11 For this commandment that I command you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it beyond your reach.
12 It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will ascend into heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?”
13 Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will cross the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?”
14 But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may do it.  


15 See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil.
16 If you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I command you today, by loving the Lord your God, by walking in His ways, and by keeping His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, then you shall live and multiply, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to possess.
17 But if your heart turns away and you do not listen, but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them,
18 I declare to you today that you shall surely perish. You shall not live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.  


19 I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore, choose life, so that you and your children may live,
20 by loving the Lord your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding fast to Him. For He is your life and the length of your days, that you may dwell in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.




Chapter 31


1 Then Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
2 He said to them, “I am now 120 years old; I can no longer go out and come in, and the Lord has told me, ‘You shall not cross over this Jordan.’
3 The Lord your God Himself will cross over before you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua will cross over before you, just as the Lord has said.
4 And the Lord will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when He destroyed them.
5 The Lord will give them over to you, and you shall do to them according to the whole commandment that I have commanded you.
6 Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or tremble before them, for the Lord your God is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you.”  


7 Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land that the Lord swore to their fathers to give them, and you shall cause them to inherit it.
8 The Lord Himself goes before you; He will be with you. He will not leave you or forsake you. Do not be afraid or dismayed.”  


9 Then Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel.
10 And Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time of the year of release, during the Feast of Booths,
11 when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place that He will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
12 Assemble the people—the men, the women, the children, and the sojourner within your gates—so that they may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God and carefully observe all the words of this law.
13 And their children, who do not know it, shall hear and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”  


14 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, the time is approaching for you to die. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, so that I may commission him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.
15 Then the Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood at the entrance of the tent.  


16 And the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, you are about to rest with your fathers, and this people will rise and play the harlot by following foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake Me and break My covenant that I made with them.
17 Then My anger will burn against them in that day, and I will forsake them and hide My face from them. They will be consumed, and many evils and troubles will come upon them, so that they will say in that day, ‘Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?’
18 But I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil that they have done by turning to other gods.  


19 Now therefore, write down this song and teach it to the sons of Israel; put it in their mouths, so that this song may be a witness for Me against the sons of Israel.
20 For when I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to their fathers, and they eat and are satisfied and grow fat, then they will turn to other gods and serve them, and they will despise Me and break My covenant.
21 Then when many evils and troubles come upon them, this song will testify against them as a witness, for it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants. For I know what they are inclined to do even now, before I bring them into the land that I swore to give them.”
22 So that day, Moses wrote down this song, and taught it to the sons of Israel.  


23 Then the Lord commissioned Joshua, the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the sons of Israel into the land that I swore to them, and I will be with you.”  


24 When Moses finished writing the words of this law in a book, until they were complete,
25 he commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying,
26 “Take this book of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, so that it may be there as a witness against you.
27 For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. Behold, even while I am still alive with you today, you have been rebellious against the Lord; how much more after my death!
28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, so that I may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
29 For I know that after my death you will surely act corruptly and turn aside from the way that I have commanded you. And in the days to come, evil will befall you because you will do what is evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger with the work of your hands.”  


30 Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were complete.




Chapter 32


1 Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak;  
    let the earth hear the words of my mouth.  
2 May my teaching drop as the rain,  
    my speech distill as the dew,  
like gentle rain upon the tender grass,  
    and like showers upon the herb.  
3 For I will proclaim the name of the Lord;  
    ascribe greatness to our God!  


4 The Rock, his work is perfect,  
    for all his ways are just.  
A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,  
    righteous and upright is he.  
5 They have dealt corruptly with him;  
    they are no longer his children because of their blemish;  
    they are a crooked and twisted generation.  
6 Do you thus repay the Lord,  
    O foolish and unwise people?  
Is he not your father who created you,  
    who made you and established you?  


7 Remember the days of old;  
    consider the years of many generations.  
Ask your father, and he will show you,  
    your elders, and they will tell you.  
8 When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,  
    when he divided mankind,  
he fixed the boundaries of the peoples  
    according to the number of the sons of God.  
9 But the Lord’s portion is his people,  
    Jacob his allotted inheritance.  


10 He found him in a desert land,  
    in the howling waste of the wilderness;  
he encircled him, he cared for him,  
    he kept him as the apple of his eye.  
11 Like an eagle that stirs up its nest,  
    that flutters over its young,  
spreading out its wings, catching them,  
    bearing them on its pinions,  
12 the Lord alone guided him,  
    and no foreign god was with him.  
13 He made him ride on the high places of the land,  
    and he ate the produce of the field,  
and he suckled him with honey from the rock,  
    and oil from the flinty stone,  
14 curds from the herd, and milk from the flock,  
    with fat of lambs,  
rams of Bashan and goats,  
    with the finest of the wheat—  
    and you drank wine, the blood of the grape.  


15 But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked;  
    you grew fat, stout, and sleek;  
then he forsook God who made him  
    and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation.  
16 They made him jealous with strange gods;  
    with abominations they provoked him to anger.  
17 They sacrificed to demons that were no gods,  
    to gods they had never known,  
to new gods that had come recently,  
    whom your fathers had never feared.  
18 You were unmindful of the Rock that bore you,  
    and you forgot the God who gave you birth.  


19 The Lord saw it and spurned them,  
    because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.  
20 And he said, “I will hide my face from them;  
    I will see what their end will be,  
for they are a perverse generation,  
    children in whom there is no faithfulness.  
21 They have made me jealous with what is no god;  
    they have provoked me to anger with their idols.  
So I will make them jealous with those who are no people;  
    I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.  
22 For a fire is kindled by my anger,  
    and it burns to the depths of the grave,  
devours the earth and its increase,  
    and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.  


23 And I will heap disasters upon them;  
    I will spend my arrows on them.  
24 They shall be wasted with hunger,  
    devoured by plague and poisonous pestilence;  
I will send the teeth of beasts against them,  
    with the venom of things that crawl in the dust.  
25 Outside the sword shall bereave,  
    and inside terror,  
for young man and virgin alike,  
    the nursing child with the man of gray hairs.  


26 I would have said, ‘I will cut them to pieces;  
    I will wipe them from human memory,’  
27 had I not feared provocation by the enemy,  
    lest their adversaries should misunderstand,  
lest they should say, ‘Our hand is triumphant,  
    it was not the Lord who did all this.’  


28 For they are a nation void of counsel,  
    and there is no understanding in them.  
29 If they were wise, they would understand this;  
    they would discern their latter end!  
30 How could one chase a thousand,  
    and two put ten thousand to flight,  
unless their Rock had sold them,  
    and the Lord had given them up?  
31 For their rock is not as our Rock;  
    our enemies are by themselves.  


32 For their vine comes from the vine of Sodom  
    and from the fields of Gomorrah;  
their grapes are grapes of poison;  
    their clusters are bitter.  
33 Their wine is the poison of serpents  
    and the cruel venom of asps.  


34 Is not this laid up in store with me,  
    sealed up in my treasuries?  
35 Vengeance is mine, and recompense,  
    for the time when their foot shall slip;  
for the day of their calamity is at hand,  
    and their doom comes swiftly.  


36 For the Lord will vindicate his people  
    and have compassion on his servants,  
when he sees that their power is gone  
    and there is none remaining, bond or free.  
37 Then he will say, ‘Where are their gods,  
    the rock in which they took refuge,  
38 who ate the fat of their sacrifices  
    and drank the wine of their drink offering?  
Let them rise up and help you;  
    let them be your protection!  


39 See now that I, I am he,  
    and there is no god besides me;  
I kill and I make alive;  
    I wound and I heal,  
    and there is none who can deliver out of my hand.  
40 For I lift up my hand to heaven  
    and swear, As I live forever,  
41 if I sharpen my flashing sword,  
    and my hand takes hold on judgment,  
I will take vengeance on my adversaries  
    and will repay those who hate me.  
42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood,  
    and my sword shall devour flesh—  
with the blood of the slain and the captives,  
    from the long-haired heads of the enemy.’  


43 Rejoice, O nations, with his people,  
    for he will avenge the blood of his servants,  
he will take vengeance on his adversaries,  
    and he will atone for his land and his people.”  


44 Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.
45 And when Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,
46 he said to them, “Set your heart on all the words that I testify among you today, that you may command your sons to be careful to do all the words of this law.
47 For it is no empty word for you, but your very life, and by this word you shall live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess.”


48 That very day the Lord spoke to Moses,
49 “Go up this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, opposite Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel for a possession.
50 And die on the mountain that you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,
51 because you broke faith with me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh in the wilderness of Zin,
52 for you shall see the land before you, but you shall not go there, into the land that I am giving to the sons of Israel.”




Chapter 33


1 This is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the sons of Israel before his death.  


2 He said, “The Lord came from Sinai and dawned upon them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran, and He came from the midst of myriads of holy ones; at His right hand was a fiery law for them.
3 Indeed, He loves the people; all His holy ones are in Your hand. They followed in Your steps; they receive Your words.
4 Moses commanded us a law, an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
5 And He was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people gathered, the tribes of Israel together.


6 “Let Reuben live and not die, nor let his men be few.”


7 This is for Judah, and he said, “Hear, O Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people. With his hands he contends for them, and You shall be his help against his adversaries.”


8 And of Levi he said, “Your Thummim and Urim belong to Your godly man, whom You tested at Massah, with whom You contended at the waters of Meribah.
9 He said of his father and his mother, ‘I have not regarded them,’ nor did he acknowledge his brothers, nor did he recognize his own sons, for they kept Your word and guarded Your covenant.
10 They shall teach Your judgments to Jacob and Your law to Israel. They shall put incense before You and whole burnt offerings on Your altar.
11 Bless, O Lord, his strength, and accept the work of his hands. Crush the loins of those who rise against him, and those who hate him, so that they may not rise again.”


12 Of Benjamin he said, “The beloved of the Lord shall dwell securely beside Him. He shields him all day long, and he dwells between His shoulders.”


13 And of Joseph he said, “Blessed by the Lord is his land, with the precious things of heaven, with dew, and with the deep waters lying below,
14 with the precious yield of the sun, and the choice produce of the months,
15 with the finest things of the ancient mountains, and the precious things of the everlasting hills,
16 with the precious things of the earth and its fullness, and the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush. Let them rest on the head of Joseph, on the crown of him who was set apart from his brothers.
17 His majesty is like the firstborn of his ox, and his horns are the horns of a wild ox. With them he will gore the peoples, all at once to the ends of the earth. These are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh.”


18 Of Zebulun he said, “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and Issachar, in your tents.
19 They will call peoples to the mountain; there they will offer righteous sacrifices, for they will draw from the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand.”


20 Of Gad he said, “Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad. He dwells as a lion and tears the arm and the crown of the head.
21 He chose the best of the land for himself, for there the ruler’s portion was reserved. He came with the leaders of the people; he carried out the righteousness of the Lord and His judgments for Israel.”


22 Of Dan he said, “Dan is a lion’s cub; he leaps out from Bashan.”


23 Of Naphtali he said, “O Naphtali, satisfied with favor and full of the blessing of the Lord, take possession of the sea and the south.”


24 Of Asher he said, “More blessed than sons is Asher; let him be favored by his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.
25 Your bolts will be iron and bronze, and your strength will last as long as your days.
26 There is none like the God of Jeshurun, who rides the heavens to your help, and in His majesty on the clouds.
27 The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He drove out the enemy before you and said, ‘Destroy!’”


28 “So Israel dwells securely, alone in a land of grain and new wine, and his heavens drop down dew.
29 Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the Lord? He is the shield of your help and the sword of your majesty! Your enemies shall cower before you, and you shall tread upon their high places.”




Chapter 34


1 Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which faces Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the land—Gilead as far as Dan,
2 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea,
3 and the Negev, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.
4 And the Lord said to him, “This is the land that I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.”


5 So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord.
6 And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor, but no man knows his burial place to this day.
7 Moses was 120 years old when he died; his eyes were not dim, nor had his strength left him.
8 And the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.


9 Now Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands on him. And the sons of Israel listened to him and did as the Lord had commanded Moses.


10 But no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,
11 in all the signs and wonders that the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt—to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land—
12 and in all the mighty power and in all the great terror that Moses displayed in the sight of all Israel.﻿Joshua


Chapter 1


1 After the death of Moses, the servant of the LORD, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying,  
2 “Moses, my servant, is dead. Now arise, cross over this river, the Jordan—you and all this people—into the land that I am giving to them, the sons of Israel.  
3 Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I have given to you, just as I promised Moses.  
4 From the wilderness and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates—all the land of the Hittites—and to the Great Sea, where the sun sets, shall be your territory.  
5 No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not abandon you or forsake you.  
6 Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give to them.  
7 Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may succeed wherever you go.  
8 This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will succeed.  
9 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”


10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,  
11 “Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people: ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves, for in three days you will cross the Jordan river to go in to take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.’”


12 And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,  
13 “Remember the word that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, ‘The LORD your God is giving you rest and is giving you this land.’  
14 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but you—all the men of valor—shall cross over armed, before your brothers, and help them,  
15 until the LORD gives rest to your brothers, as He has to you, and they also possess the land that the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall return to your own land and take possession of it, the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.”


16 And they answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.  
17 Just as we obeyed Moses in everything, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses.  
18 Anyone who rebels against your command and does not obey your words in all that you command him shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”




Chapter 2


1 Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two men from Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, look over the land, especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
2 But it was reported to the king of Jericho: “Look, some men from the sons of Israel have come here tonight to scout out the land.”
3 So the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab: “Bring out the men who came to you, who entered your house, for they have come to spy out the whole land.”


4 But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I didn’t know where they were from.
5 And at dusk, when the gate was about to be shut, the men went out. I don’t know where they went. Pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.”
6 (She had, however, taken them up to the roof and hidden them under stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)
7 So the men pursued them along the road to the Jordan river, as far as the fords. And as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.


8 Before the men lay down, she went up to them on the roof
9 and said to them, “I know that the Lord has given you the land, and that fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
10 For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan ruber—Sihon and Og—whom you devoted to destruction.
11 And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and no spirit remained in any man because of you. For the Lord your God, He is God in the heavens above and on the earth below.
12 Now therefore, please swear to me by the Lord that, as I have shown you kindness, you also will show kindness to my father’s house—and give me a sure sign—
13 that you will spare the lives of my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will deliver our lives from death.”


14 So the men said to her, “Our lives for yours, even to death. If you do not report this business of ours, then when the Lord gives us the land, we will deal kindly and faithfully with you.”


15 Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall; she lived in the wall.
16 And she said to them, “Go to the hills, so that the pursuers may not find you. Hide there for three days until they return; then afterward you may go on your way.”


17 The men said to her, “We will be released from this oath you made us swear,
18 unless, when we enter the land, you tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you gather your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household into your house.
19 If anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we will be innocent. But if anyone is with you in the house and is harmed, his blood shall be on our head.
20 But if you report this business of ours, then we shall be released from the oath you made us swear.”


21 She said, “Let it be according to your words.” So she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.


22 They departed and went into the hills and remained there three days, until the pursuers returned. The pursuers searched all along the way but did not find them.
23 Then the two men returned. They came down from the hills, crossed over, and came to Joshua son of Nun, and they recounted to him all that had happened to them.
24 And they said to Joshua, “Truly the Lord has given all the land into our hands, and moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us.”




Chapter 3


1 Joshua rose early in the morning, and he and all the sons of Israel set out from Shittim. They came to the Jordan river, and they lodged there before crossing over.  
2 And it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the midst of the camp,
3 and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the Levitical priests bearing it, then you shall set out from your place and follow it.
4 Yet you shall keep a distance between you and it—about two thousand cubits. Do not come near it, so that you may know the way you should go, for you have not passed this way before.”


5 Then Joshua said to the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.”  
6 And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.


7 The LORD said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so that they will know that just as I was with Moses, I will be with you.
8 And you shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’”


9 Then Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.”
10 And Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will certainly drive out the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite from before you.
11 See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is about to cross over ahead of you into the Jordan.
12 So now, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.  
13 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, come to rest in the waters of the Jordan river, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off—the waters flowing down from above—and they will stand in a heap.”


14 So it happened, when the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan river, with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant ahead of the people,
15 and when those bearing the ark came as far as the Jordan river, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark dipped in the edge of the water (now the Jordan river overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest),
16 then the waters that were flowing down from above stood still; they rose up in a large heap far off at Adam, the city beside Zarethan, and those flowing down toward the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) were completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.


17 And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firmly on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan river, and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until the entire nation had completed crossing the Jordan river.




Chapter 4


1 When the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan river, the Lord said to Joshua,
2 “Take twelve men from among the people, one man from each tribe,
3 and command them: ‘Take up twelve stones from here out of the middle of the Jordan river, from the exact place where the priests’ feet stood firmly, and carry them with you. Lay them down in the place where you will lodge tonight.’”
4 So Joshua summoned the twelve men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe.
5 And Joshua said to them, “Pass on before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each of you lift a stone onto his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,
6 so that this may be a sign among you. When your sons ask in time to come, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’  
7 then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan river were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be a memorial for the sons of Israel forever.”


8 And the sons of Israel did just as Joshua commanded. They took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan river, as the Lord had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel. They carried them with them to the lodging place and laid them down there.
9 And Joshua set up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan, in the spot where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood. They remain there to this day.  


10 Now the priests carrying the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan river until everything had been completed that the Lord commanded Joshua to tell the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried and crossed over.  
11 And when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of the Lord and the priests crossed over before the people.  
12 The sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle formation before the sons of Israel, as Moses had told them.  
13 About forty thousand men, equipped for war, crossed over before the Lord for battle, into the plains of Jericho.  


14 On that day the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they held him in awe all the days of his life, just as they had held Moses in awe.  
15 And the Lord said to Joshua,  
16 “Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan river.”  
17 So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan river.”  
18 And when the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord came up from the midst of the Jordan river, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted onto dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks as before.


19 The people came up from the Jordan river on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped at Gilgal, to the east of Jericho.  
20 And those twelve stones which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal.
21 He said to the sons of Israel, “When your sons ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What are these stones?’  
22 then you shall let your sons know, ‘Israel crossed over this Jordan river on dry ground here.’  
23 For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you had crossed over, just as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed.
24 He did this so that all the nations of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord is mighty, so that you may fear the Lord your God all your days.”




Chapter 5


1 When all the kings of the Amorites west of the Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea heard how the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, their hearts melted. There was no spirit left in them because of the Israelites.


2 At that time the Lord said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel again a second time.”  
3 So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.  
4 This is the reason Joshua circumcised them: all the males who came out of Egypt—all the warriors—had died in the wilderness on the way after they had come out of Egypt.  
5 Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, all the people born in the wilderness along the way after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised.  
6 For the Israelites had walked forty years in the wilderness until all the nation—the men of war who came out of Egypt—perished, because they did not obey the voice of the Lord. The Lord swore to them that He would not let them see the land that He had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.  
7 So He raised up their sons in their place; these Joshua circumcised. For they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised along the way.  
8 When they had finished circumcising the entire nation, they stayed in their places in the camp until they had healed.  
9 Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.


10 While the Israelites were encamped at Gilgal, they kept the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on the plains of Jericho.  
11 And on the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land—unleavened bread and roasted grain.  
12 And the manna ceased the day after they ate from the produce of the land. There was no longer manna for the Israelites, and they ate from the yield of the land of Canaan that year.


13 When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua approached him and said, “Are you for us or for our adversaries?”  
14 He said, “No, but I am the commander of the army of the Lord. I have now come.” Then Joshua fell face down to the ground and worshiped, and he said to him, “What does my lord say to his servant?”  
15 The commander of the Lord’s army said to Joshua, “Take off your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.




Chapter 6


1 Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the sons of Israel; no one went out, and no one came in.  
2 Then the LORD said to Joshua, “See, I have handed Jericho over to you, with its king and valiant warriors.  
3 You shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. Do this for six days.  
4 And seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.  
5 When they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; then the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people shall go up, each straight ahead.”


6 So Joshua the son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.”  
7 And he said to the people, “Advance and march around the city, and the armed men shall go ahead of the ark of the LORD.”


8 And just as Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the LORD advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.  
9 The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed behind the ark while the trumpets kept sounding.  
10 But Joshua had commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, nor let a word proceed from your mouth until the day I tell you to shout—then you shall shout!”  
11 So he had the ark of the LORD circle the city once, and they came back to the camp and spent the night there.


12 Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.  
13 The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually and blew the trumpets, and the armed men went ahead of them, and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD while the trumpets kept sounding.  
14 So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.


15 Then on the seventh day they rose early, at daybreak, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times—only on that day they marched around the city seven times.  
16 And the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For the LORD has given you the city.  
17 And the city shall be devoted to the LORD for destruction, it and all that is in it. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in the house shall live, because she hid the messengers we sent.  
18 But as for you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, so that you do not covet them and take any of the devoted things, and make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble upon it.  
19 But all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD.”


20 So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. And it happened that when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, they raised a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, each straight ahead, and they captured the city.  
21 They devoted to destruction by the edge of the sword all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey.


22 But Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the house of the woman, the prostitute, and bring out the woman and all who belong to her, as you swore to her.”  
23 So the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and all who belonged to her—they also brought out all her relatives—and they set them outside the camp of Israel.  
24 Then they burned the city with fire, and everything in it. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.  
25 But Rahab the prostitute, and her father’s household and all who belonged to her, Joshua spared; and she has lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.


26 At that time Joshua made them take an oath, saying, “Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho; at the cost of his firstborn he shall lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest he shall set up its gates.”  
27 So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.




Chapter 7


1 But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully with regard to the devoted things, for Achan son of Karmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things; so the anger of the LORD burned against the sons of Israel.


2 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.
3 They returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not have all the people go up; let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not trouble all the people there, for they are few.”
4 So about three thousand men from the people went up there, but they fled before the men of Ai.
5 The men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of them, chasing them from the city gate as far as Shebarim and striking them down on the descent. As a result, the hearts of the people melted and became like water.


6 Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of the LORD until evening—he and the elders of Israel. And they put dust on their heads.
7 Joshua said, “Alas, Lord GOD, why did You ever bring this people across the Jordan at all—to hand us over into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan!
8 O Lord, what can I say now that Israel has turned its back before its enemies?
9 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it; they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?”


10 The LORD said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why have you fallen on your face?
11 Israel has sinned; indeed, they have transgressed My covenant that I commanded them. They have even taken some of the devoted things, and have stolen, deceived, and put them among their own belongings.
12 Therefore, the sons of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the devoted thing from your midst.
13 Get up! Consecrate the people and say, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: There is a devoted thing in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you remove the devoted thing from among you.
14 In the morning, you shall come forward by your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the LORD selects shall come forward clan by clan, and the clan which the LORD selects shall come forward household by household, and the household which the LORD selects shall come forward man by man.
15 And the one who is caught with the devoted thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD and because he has committed an outrage in Israel.’”


16 So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected.
17 He brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahites was selected. Then he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was selected.
18 He brought near his household man by man, and Achan son of Karmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.


19 Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give Him praise, and tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.”


20 Achan answered Joshua and said, “Truly I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel, and this is what I did:
21 When I saw among the spoils a beautiful cloak from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And look, they are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver beneath it.”


22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent with the silver beneath it.
23 They took them from inside the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel, and they laid them out before the LORD.


24 Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah, and the silver, the cloak, and the bar of gold, and his sons, his daughters, his oxen, donkeys, and sheep, his tent, and all that belonged to him; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.


25 Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? The LORD will trouble you this day.” Then all Israel stoned him with stones, and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.
26 They raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day. Then the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore, the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor to this day.




Chapter 8


1 Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid or dismayed. Take all the men of war with you and rise up, go to Ai. Look, I have given the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land into your hand.  
2 You shall do to Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may take its spoil and its livestock as plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush against the city behind it.”  


3 So Joshua arose with all the people of war to go up to Ai. He chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor and sent them out by night.  
4 He commanded them, saying, “See, you shall lie in ambush behind the city. Don’t go very far from it, and all of you stay alert.  
5 I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. When they come out to meet us as they did before, we will flee before them.  
6 They will pursue us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are fleeing before us just like last time.’ So we will flee before them,  
7 and then you will rise up from the ambush and seize the city, for the Lord your God will give it into your hand.  
8 When you have taken the city, set it on fire, according to the word of the Lord. See, I have commanded you.”  


9 So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of ambush and stayed between Bethel and Ai, west of Ai. But Joshua spent that night among the people.  


10 Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people. He went up with the elders of Israel before the people to Ai.  
11 All the men of war who were with him went up and drew near the city, and they camped north of Ai, with a valley between them and the city.  
12 He had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, west of the city.  
13 So the main camp was north of the city, with the rear guard west of it. And Joshua spent that night in the valley.  


14 When the king of Ai saw this, the men of the city hurried and rose early to go out to battle against Israel at the appointed place, facing the Arabah. But he did not know that there was an ambush behind the city.  
15 And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled toward the wilderness.  
16 All the people in the city were called together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city.  
17 Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel, and they left the city open and pursued Israel.  


18 Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.” So Joshua stretched out the javelin in his hand toward the city.  
19 As soon as he did, the men in ambush rose quickly from their position and ran. They entered the city, captured it, and hurried to set it on fire.  
20 When the men of Ai turned and looked back, they saw smoke rising from the city into the sky. They had no strength to flee in any direction. Then the people of Israel who had been fleeing turned back against their pursuers.  
21 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke was rising from it, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.  
22 The others came out from the city to meet them, so they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. They struck them down so that none survived or escaped.  
23 But they seized the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.  


24 When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field and in the wilderness where they had pursued them, and when they had all fallen by the edge of the sword until they were destroyed, then all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the sword.  
25 All who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand—all the people of Ai.  
26 Joshua did not draw back his hand with the javelin until he had devoted to destruction all who lived in Ai.  
27 However, Israel took the livestock and the spoils of that city as plunder for themselves, according to the word of the Lord that he had commanded Joshua.  
28 So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap of ruins forever—a desolation to this day.  
29 He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening. At sunset, Joshua commanded that they take his corpse down from the tree, and they threw it at the entrance of the city gate and raised a great heap of stones over it, which remains to this day.  


30 Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,  
31 just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: an altar of uncut stones on which no iron tool had been used. They offered burnt offerings to the Lord on it and sacrificed peace offerings.  
32 And there, in the presence of the Israelites, he wrote on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses, which he had written.  


33 All Israel, with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, both the foreigner and the native. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded to bless the people of Israel first.  
34 Afterward, he read all the words of the law—the blessing and the curse—according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.  
35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, including the women, the little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them.




Chapter 9


1 When all the kings who were beyond the Jordan—in the hill country, in the lowland, and along the entire coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon (the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite)—heard of this,
2 they gathered together as one to fight against Joshua and Israel.


3 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
4 they acted craftily. They went and prepared provisions and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys, and wineskins worn out, torn, and patched,
5 and worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out garments on themselves. All the bread of their provisions was dry and crumbled.
6 And they went to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a covenant with us.”


7 But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a covenant with you?”
8 They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” And Joshua said to them, “Who are you, and where do you come from?”


9 They said to him, “Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the name of the LORD your God. For we have heard a report about Him and all that He did in Egypt,
10 and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan—to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth.
11 So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land said to us, ‘Take provisions in your hand for the journey and go to meet them and say to them, “We are your servants. Now then, make a covenant with us.”’
12 This bread of ours was warm when we took it from our houses as our provision on the day we left to come to you, but now behold, it is dry and crumbled.
13 These wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they are torn. These garments and sandals of ours are worn out because of the very long journey.”


14 So the men of Israel took some of their provisions, but did not inquire of the LORD.
15 And Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them.


16 And it came about at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard they were their neighbors and were living among them.
17 Then the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
18 But the sons of Israel did not strike them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. And all the congregation grumbled against the leaders.


19 But all the leaders said to the whole congregation, “We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them.
20 This we will do to them: let them live, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath that we swore to them.”


21 So the leaders said to them, “Let them live.” Thus they became cutters of wood and drawers of water for the whole congregation, just as the leaders had spoken to them.


22 Then Joshua summoned them and said, “Why did you deceive us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you are living among us?
23 Now therefore, you are cursed, and none of you shall cease to be slaves—cutters of wood and drawers of water—for the house of my God.”


24 And they answered Joshua and said, “Because it was clearly told to your servants that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you, so we feared greatly for our lives because of you, and we did this thing.
25 Now behold, we are in your hand. Do as it seems good and right in your eyes to deal with us.”


26 So he did this to them and delivered them from the hand of the sons of Israel, and they did not kill them.
27 But on that day Joshua made them cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to this day, in the place that He would choose.




Chapter 10


1 When Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and utterly destroyed it—doing to Ai and its king just as he had done to Jericho and its king—and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living among them,
2 he feared greatly. Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and it was greater than Ai, and all its men were warriors.
3 So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
4 “Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.”
5 So the five kings of the Amorites—the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon—gathered together and went up with all their armies, and they encamped against Gibeon and made war against it.


6 Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, “Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country have assembled against us.”
7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
8 And the Lord said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have given them into your hand. Not a man of them shall stand before you.”
9 So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal.


10 And the Lord threw them into confusion before Israel, and He struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
11 And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth-horon, the Lord hurled down large stones from the sky upon them as far as Azekah, and they died. More died from the hailstones than the sons of Israel killed with the sword.


12 Then Joshua spoke to the Lord on the day the Lord gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel:


    “Sun, stand still at Gibeon,
        and Moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.”


13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of the sky and did not hasten to go down for about a full day.
14 There has been no day like it before or since, when the Lord listened to the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for Israel.
15 Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.


16 Now these five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
17 And it was told to Joshua, “The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”
18 Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them.
19 But you—do not stay there. Pursue your enemies and attack them from behind. Do not let them enter their cities, for the Lord your God has given them into your hand.”


20 When Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking them with a very great blow until they were wiped out, and the survivors who escaped had entered the fortified cities,
21 all the people returned safely to Joshua at the camp at Makkedah. No one dared to speak a word against the sons of Israel.


22 Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.”
23 So they brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
24 When they had brought those kings out to Joshua, he called for all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came near and put their feet on their necks.
25 Then Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid or dismayed. Be strong and courageous, for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.”
26 And afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees. They hung on the trees until evening.
27 But at the time of sunset Joshua gave the command, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set large stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.


28 Joshua captured Makkedah on that day and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He devoted to destruction every living person in it; he left no survivor. And he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.


29 Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah.
30 And the Lord gave it also into the hand of Israel, and he struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor in it, and he did to its king just as he had done to the king of Jericho.


31 Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish, and he encamped against it and fought against it.
32 And the Lord gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every living person in it, just as he had done to Libnah.
33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people, until he left him no survivor.


34 Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon, and they encamped against it and fought against it.
35 And they captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword, and he devoted every living person in it to destruction on that day, just as he had done to Lachish.


36 Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it.
37 And they captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every living person in it. He left no survivor, just as he had done to Eglon, and he devoted it to destruction and every living person in it.


38 Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned back to Debir and fought against it.
39 And he captured it, its king, and all its towns, and they struck them with the edge of the sword and devoted to destruction every living person in it. He left no survivor. Just as he had done to Hebron, and as he had done to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and its king.


40 So Joshua struck the whole land—the hill country, the Negev, the lowland, and the slopes—and all their kings. He left no survivor, but devoted to destruction everything that breathed, just as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded.
41 And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea as far as Gaza, and the whole land of Goshen as far as Gibeon.
42 Joshua captured all these kings and their land at one time, because the Lord, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
43 Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.




Chapter 11


1 When Jabin, king of Hazor, heard of this, he sent to Jobab, king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
2 and to the kings who were in the northern hill country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the hill country of Dor on the west,
3 to the Canaanites in the east and the west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites under Hermon, in the land of Mizpah.
4 And they came out, with all their troops, a great horde, in number like the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.
5 And all these kings joined their forces and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.


6 And the Lord said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, for tomorrow at this time I will give them all over, slain, to Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire."
7 So Joshua and all his warriors came suddenly against them by the waters of Merom and fell upon them.
8 And the Lord gave them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and chased them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and eastward as far as the valley of Mizpah. And they struck them until he left none remaining.
9 And Joshua did to them just as the Lord said to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.


10 And Joshua turned back at that time and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms.
11 And they struck with the sword all who were in it, devoting them to destruction; there was none left that breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire.
12 And all the cities of those kings and all their kings Joshua captured and struck them with the sword, devoting them to destruction, just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded.
13 But none of the cities that stood on mounds did Israel burn, except Hazor alone; Joshua burned that one.
14 And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the people of Israel took for their plunder. But every person they struck with the sword, until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave any who breathed.
15 As the Lord had commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and that's what Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses.


16 So Joshua took all that land: the hill country, and all the Negev, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill country of Israel and its lowland
17 from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them and put them to death.
18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
19 There was not a city that made peace with the people of Israel except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took them all in battle.
20 For it was the Lord's doing to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, in order that they should be devoted to destruction and should receive no mercy but be destroyed, just as the Lord commanded Moses.


21 And Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction with their cities.
22 And there was none of the Anakim left in the land of the people of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod did some remain.
23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord had spoken to Moses. And Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal allotments. And the land had rest from war.




Chapter 12


1 These are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel struck down and took possession of their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:


2 Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, and from the middle of the valley, and half of Gilead, as far as the Wadi Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon;  
3 and the Arabah to the Sea of Kinnereth eastward, and as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, eastward in the direction of Beth Jeshimoth, and southward to the foot of the slopes of Pisgah.


4 And the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,  
5 and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half of Gilead, as far as the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.  
6 Moses the servant of the LORD and the sons of Israel struck them down; and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it as a possession to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.


7 These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel struck down on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir; and Joshua gave it as a possession to the tribes of Israel according to their divisions,  
8 in the hill country and in the lowland, in the Arabah, in the slopes and in the wilderness, and in the Negev — the land of the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:


9 the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;  
10 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;  
11 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;  
12 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;  
13 the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;  
14 the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;  
15 the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;  
16 the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;  
17 the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;  
18 the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;  
19 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;  
20 the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;  
21 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;  
22 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;  
23 the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;  
24 the king of Tirzah, one — in all, thirty-one kings.




Chapter 13


1 Now Joshua was old and advanced in years, and the LORD said to him, “You are old and advanced in years, and much of the land remains to be possessed.  
2 This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites,  
3 from Shihor, which is east of Egypt, to the border of Ekron to the north—it is counted as Canaanite; there are five rulers of the Philistines: the Gazites, the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites. Also the Avvim  
4 in the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;  
5 and the land of the Gebalites, all of Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath.  
6 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians—I will drive them out from before the sons of Israel; only allot it to Israel for an inheritance, just as I have commanded you.  
7 Now divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”  


8 With the other half-tribe, the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them:  
9 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba as far as Dibon;  
10 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, up to the border of the sons of Ammon;  
11 and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah;  
12 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei—he alone remained of the remnant of the Rephaim—and Moses had defeated them and driven them out.  
13 But the sons of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites; so Geshur and Maacath dwell among Israel to this day.  


14 Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, just as He said to them.  


15 Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their clans.  
16 Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;  
17 Heshbon and all its towns that are in the plain: Dibon, Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,  
18 and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,  
19 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley,  
20 and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth;  
21 all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck down with the chiefs of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, dwelling in the land.  
22 And Balaam the son of Beor, the one who practiced divination, the sons of Israel killed with the sword among the rest of their slain.  
23 The border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan as a boundary. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their clans, with the cities and their villages.  


24 Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad according to their clans.  
25 Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, as far as Aroer, which is before Rabbah;  
26 and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;  
27 and in the valley, Beth-haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a boundary, as far as the end of the Sea of Chinnereth east of the Jordan.  
28 This was the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their clans, with the cities and their villages.  


29 Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh, and it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their clans.  
30 Their territory was from Mahanaim, all of Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities;  
31 and half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their clans.  


32 These are the inheritances that Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan east of Jericho.  
33 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; the LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, just as He said to them.




Chapter 14


1 These are the allotments that the sons of Israel received in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel distributed to them.  
2 Their inheritance was assigned by lot, just as the Lord had commanded through Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.  
3 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan, but he gave no inheritance among them to the Levites.  
4 For the sons of Joseph became two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities in which to live, with their pasture lands for their livestock and possessions.  
5 Just as the Lord had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did; and they divided the land.


6 Then the sons of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the word that the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and you at Kadesh-barnea.  
7 I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought him back a report according to what was in my heart.  
8 But my brothers who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt, whereas I followed the Lord my God fully.  
9 So Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land on which your foot has walked shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have fully followed the Lord my God.’  
10 Now behold, the Lord has kept me alive, just as He said, these forty-five years since the Lord spoke this word to Moses, while Israel wandered in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am eighty-five years old today.  
11 I am still as strong today as I was on the day that Moses sent me; my strength then was as my strength is now, for war and for going out and coming in.  
12 So now give me this hill country of which the Lord spoke on that day. For you heard on that day that the Anakim were there, with great fortified cities. Perhaps the Lord will be with me, and I shall drive them out just as the Lord has said.”


13 Then Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb son of Jephunneh as an inheritance.  
14 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he fully followed the Lord, the God of Israel.  
15 Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba; Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.




Chapter 15


1 The allotment for the tribe of the sons of Judah, according to their clans, extended southward to the boundary of Edom, to the wilderness of Zin at the farthest south.  
2 Their southern boundary ran from the end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward.  
3 Then it proceeded southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and passed on to Zin, and went up south of Kadesh-barnea and passed on to Hezron, and went up to Addar and turned about to Karka.  
4 From there it passed on to Azmon and went out by the Brook of Egypt, and the border ended at the sea. This shall be their southern boundary.  


5 The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea, as far as the mouth of the Jordan. The northern boundary began at the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan.  
6 It went up to Beth-hoglah and passed north of Beth-arabah; and the boundary went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.  
7 The boundary went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and turned northward toward Gilgal, which faces the ascent of Adummim, which is south of the valley; and the boundary continued to the waters of En-shemesh, and ended at En-rogel.  
8 Then the boundary went up the Valley of Ben-Hinnom to the south slope of the Jebusite—that is, Jerusalem—and the boundary went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the Valley of Rephaim northward.  
9 The boundary curved from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron; then the boundary curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim).  
10 From Baalah the boundary turned westward to Mount Seir, passed along to the slope of Mount Jearim on the north (that is, Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh and passed through Timnah.  
11 The boundary went out to the slope of Ekron northward, and curved to Shikkeron, passed along to Mount Baalah, and went out to Jabneel. Then the boundary ended at the sea.  
12 The western boundary was the Great Sea with its coastline. This was the boundary around the sons of Judah according to their clans.


13 Now to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the sons of Judah, according to the command of the LORD to Joshua, namely, Kiriath-arba (Arba was the father of Anak), that is, Hebron.  
14 Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak.  
15 Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir (now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher).  
16 And Caleb said, “Whoever strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as a wife.”  
17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it, so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife.  
18 When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she got down from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you desire?”  
19 She said to him, “Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.


20 This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their clans.  
21 The cities at the farthest south of the tribe of the sons of Judah, toward the boundary of Edom in the Negev, were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,  
22 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,  
23 Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,  
24 Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,  
25 Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor),  
26 Amam, Shema, Moladah,  
27 Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet,  
28 Hazar-shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah,  
29 Baalah, Iim, Ezem,  
30 Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah,  
31 Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,  
32 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon; in all, twenty-nine cities with their villages.


33 In the lowland: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah,  
34 Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, Enam,  
35 Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,  
36 Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages.  


37 Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad,  
38 Dilean, Mizpeh, Joktheel,  
39 Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,  
40 Cabbon, Lahmas, Chitlish,  
41 Gederoth, Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.


42 Libnah, Ether, Ashan,  
43 Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,  
44 Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.


45 Ekron, with its towns and its villages;  
46 from Ekron to the sea, all that were near Ashdod, with their villages.  
47 Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages, as far as the Brook of Egypt and the Great Sea with its coastline.


48 In the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,  
49 Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir),  
50 Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,  
51 Goshen, Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.  


52 Arab, Dumah, Eshan,  
53 Janim, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah,  
54 Humtah, Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages.


55 Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah,  
56 Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,  
57 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.


58 Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor,  
59 Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.


60 Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.


61 In the wilderness: Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah,  
62 Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.


63 But the sons of Judah could not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; so the Jebusites dwell with the sons of Judah in Jerusalem to this day.




Chapter 16


1 The allotment for the descendants of Joseph began at the Jordan near Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, then went up through the wilderness into the hill country to Bethel.
2 It went out from Bethel to Luz, and passed along to Ataroth, the territory of the Archites.
3 Then it went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the border of Lower Beth-horon, and on to Gezer, and ended at the sea.
4 So the descendants of Joseph—Manasseh and Ephraim—received their inheritance.


5 The territory of the descendants of Ephraim by their clans was as follows: the boundary of their inheritance on the east was Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon.
6 The boundary went out westward to the sea, from Michmethath on the north, then turned eastward to Taanath-shiloh, and passed beyond it to the east to Janoah.
7 Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, touched Jericho, and ended at the Jordan.
8 From Tappuah the boundary went westward to the Brook of Kanah and ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Ephraim by their clans,
9 along with the cities that were set apart for the descendants of Ephraim within the inheritance of the descendants of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
10 But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer; so the Canaanites have lived within Ephraim to this day, but they became forced laborers.




Chapter 17


1 The allotment for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph, was as follows: to Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war.
2 So the rest of the sons of Manasseh received their portion by their clans: the sons of Abiezer, the sons of Helek, the sons of Asriel, the sons of Shechem, the sons of Hepher, and the sons of Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, by their clans.


3 Now Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
4 They came before Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, and said, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” So, in accordance with the command of the LORD, he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.


5 Thus there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan,
6 because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead was given to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.


7 The border of Manasseh went from Asher to Michmethath, which is east of Shechem. Then the boundary went southward to the inhabitants of En-Tappuah.
8 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah itself, on the border of Manasseh, belonged to the sons of Ephraim.
9 Then the boundary descended to the Brook of Kanah, southward of the brook. These cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh. The boundary of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and it ended at the sea.
10 The land to the south belonged to Ephraim and that to the north to Manasseh, and the sea was its border. They met in Asher on the north and in Issachar on the east.
11 In Issachar and Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its towns, Ibleam and its towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of Endor and its towns, the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns—the third is Napheth.


12 Yet the sons of Manasseh could not take possession of those cities, because the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.
13 But when the sons of Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not drive them out completely.


14 Then the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua and said, “Why have you given us only one lot and one portion as an inheritance, though we are a numerous people, whom the LORD has thus far blessed?”
15 And Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear ground for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.”
16 The sons of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who dwell in the valley have iron chariots—both those in Beth-shean and its towns and those in the Valley of Jezreel.”
17 Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, “You are a numerous people and have great strength. You shall not have just one lot,
18 but the hill country shall be yours. Though it is forested, you shall clear it, and it shall be yours to its farthest borders. For you shall drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots and though they are strong.”




Chapter 18


1 The whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and they set up the Tent of Meeting there. The land was subdued before them.
2 Yet there remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes that had not divided their inheritance.


3 So Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “How long will you delay going in to take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?
4 Appoint from among you three men from each tribe, and I will send them out; they shall arise and go through the land and describe it according to their inheritance, and then return to me.
5 They shall divide it into seven portions—Judah shall remain in his territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory on the north.
6 You shall describe the land in seven divisions, and bring the description here to me. Then I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.


7 For the Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan to the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.”


8 So the men arose and went, and Joshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, “Go and walk through the land and describe it, and return to me. Then I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.”
9 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
10 Then Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD, and there Joshua divided the land among the sons of Israel according to their divisions.


11 The lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot lay between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.
12 Their border on the north side was from the Jordan, and the border went up to the slope of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward, and it ended at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
13 From there the border passed to Luz, to the southern slope of Luz (that is, Bethel). Then the border went down to Ataroth-addar, near the hill that lies south of Lower Beth-horon.


14 The border turned and went around the west side southward from the hill that lies to the south opposite Beth-horon, and it ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the west side.
15 Then the south side was from the end of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went westward and came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
16 The border went down to the foot of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Ben-hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the Valley of Hinnom, to the southern slope of the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem). And the border went down to the spring of En-rogel.


17 Then it turned northward and went to En-shemesh and went to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
18 It passed on to the north of the slope of Beth-arabah and went down to the Arabah.
19 The border passed on to the north side of Beth-hoglah, and the border ended at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the southern border.
20 And the Jordan was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families, by its boundaries all around.


21 Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were: Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz,
22 Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
23 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
24 Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages.


25 Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
26 Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,
27 Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
28 Zela, Haeleph, Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families.


Chapter 19


1 The second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their clans. Their inheritance was within the inheritance of the sons of Judah.
2 They received as their inheritance: Beersheba (also known as Sheba), Moladah,
3 Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem,
4 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,
5 Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah,
6 Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen—thirteen cities with their villages.


7 Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan—four cities with their villages,
8 and all the villages that were around these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negev. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their clans.
9 The inheritance of the sons of Simeon was taken from the portion of the sons of Judah, because the portion of the sons of Judah was too large for them. So the sons of Simeon received an inheritance within Judah’s inheritance.


10 The third lot came up for the sons of Zebulun according to their clans. The territory of their inheritance reached as far as Sarid.
11 Their border went up westward to Maralah, touched Dabbesheth, and reached the wadi that is opposite Jokneam.
12 It turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to the border of Chisloth-tabor, then went on to Daberath and up to Japhia.
13 From there it passed eastward to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and came out at Rimmon, turning toward Neah.
14 Then the border turned on the north to Hannathon, and it ended at the Valley of Iphtahel.


15 Included were Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem—twelve cities with their villages.
16 This was the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun according to their clans—these cities with their villages.


17 The fourth lot came out for Issachar, for the sons of Issachar according to their clans.
18 Their territory included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem,
19 Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,
20 Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,
21 Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez.
22 The border touched Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, and its boundary ended at the Jordan—sixteen cities with their villages.
23 This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their clans—the cities with their villages.


24 The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their clans.
25 Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph,
26 Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. On the west the border touched Carmel and Shihor-libnath.
27 Then it turned eastward to Beth-dagon, touched Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel, and it went north to Cabul.
28 Also included were Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon.
29 The border turned toward Ramah and as far as the fortified city of Tyre. Then the border turned to Hosah, and it ended at the sea near the region of Achzib.
30 Also included were Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob—twenty-two cities with their villages.
31 This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their clans—these cities with their villages.


32 The sixth lot came out for the sons of Naphtali, for the sons of Naphtali according to their clans.
33 Their border ran from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and it ended at the Jordan.
34 The border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and from there it went to Hukkok. It touched Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Judah at the Jordan on the east.
35 The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,
36 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,
37 Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor,
38 Yiron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh—nineteen cities with their villages.
39 This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali according to their clans—the cities with their villages.


40 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their clans.
41 The territory of their inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh,
42 Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,
43 Elon, Timnah, Ekron,
44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,
45 Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon,
46 and Me-jarkon and Rakkon, with the territory opposite Joppa.


47 But the territory of the sons of Dan was too small for them, so the sons of Dan went up and fought against Leshem. After capturing it and striking it with the sword, they took possession of it, settled there, and renamed it Dan after the name of their father Dan.
48 This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their clans—these cities with their villages.


49 When they finished distributing the land according to its borders, the sons of Israel gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them.
50 According to the word of the Lord, they gave him the city that he asked for, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. He built up the city and settled in it.


51 These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the sons of Israel distributed by lot at Shiloh before the Lord, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing the land.




Chapter 20


1 Then the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,  
2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘Appoint for yourselves the cities of refuge, about which I spoke to you through Moses,  
3 so that the manslayer who strikes down a man unintentionally, without premeditation, may flee there, and they shall be for you a refuge from the avenger of blood.  
4 And he shall flee to one of those cities and stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and state his case in the hearing of the elders of that city. Then they shall take him into the city and give him a place, so that he may dwell among them.  
5 Now if the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not deliver the manslayer into his hand, because he struck down his fellow man without premeditation and did not hate him beforehand.  
6 And he shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest who is in office in those days. Then the manslayer shall return and come to his own city and to his own house, to the city from which he fled.”


7 So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.  
8 Beyond the Jordan river, east of Jericho, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plain, from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.


9 These were the cities appointed for all the sons of Israel and for the sojourner who dwells among them, so that whoever struck down a man unintentionally might flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood before standing before the congregation.




Chapter 21


1 Then the heads of the fathers of the Levites came near to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
2 And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “The LORD commanded through Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their pasturelands for our livestock.”
3 So the sons of Israel gave to the Levites, from their inheritance, according to the command of the LORD, these cities with their pasturelands.


4 The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, received by lot thirteen cities from the tribe of Judah, from the tribe of Simeon, and from the tribe of Benjamin.
5 And the rest of the sons of Kohath received by lot ten cities from the families of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
6 And the sons of Gershon received by lot thirteen cities from the families of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
7 The sons of Merari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
8 So the sons of Israel gave to the Levites these cities with their pasturelands, as the LORD had commanded through Moses by lot.


9 From the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon, they gave these cities which are mentioned by name.
10 And they were for the sons of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, of the sons of Levi, for the lot was theirs first.
11 And they gave them Kiriath-arba (Arba being the father of Anak), that is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with its surrounding pasturelands.
12 But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
13 So they gave to the sons of Aaron the priest: Hebron, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasturelands; Libnah with its pasturelands;
14 Jattir with its pasturelands, Eshtemoa with its pasturelands;
15 Holon with its pasturelands, Debir with its pasturelands;
16 Ain with its pasturelands, Juttah with its pasturelands, and Beth-shemesh with its pasturelands—nine cities from these two tribes.


17 And from the tribe of Benjamin: Gibeon with its pasturelands, Geba with its pasturelands,
18 Anathoth with its pasturelands, and Almon with its pasturelands—four cities.
19 All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their pasturelands.


20 And the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites who remained of the sons of Kohath, received the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim.
21 They gave them Shechem, the city of refuge for the manslayer, in the hill country of Ephraim, with its pasturelands; Gezer with its pasturelands;
22 Kibzaim with its pasturelands, and Beth-horon with its pasturelands—four cities.
23 And from the tribe of Dan: Elteke with its pasturelands, Gibbethon with its pasturelands,
24 Aijalon with its pasturelands, Gath-rimmon with its pasturelands—four cities.
25 And from the half-tribe of Manasseh: Taanach with its pasturelands, and Gath-rimmon with its pasturelands—two cities.
26 All the cities with their pasturelands for the families of the remaining sons of Kohath were ten cities.


27 And to the sons of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, from the half-tribe of Manasseh: Golan in Bashan, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasturelands, and Beeshterah with its pasturelands—two cities.
28 And from the tribe of Issachar: Kishion with its pasturelands, Daberath with its pasturelands,
29 Jarmuth with its pasturelands, En-gannim with its pasturelands—four cities.
30 And from the tribe of Asher: Mishal with its pasturelands, Abdon with its pasturelands,
31 Helkath with its pasturelands, and Rehob with its pasturelands—four cities.
32 And from the tribe of Naphtali: Kedesh in Galilee, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasturelands, Hammoth-dor with its pasturelands, and Kartan with its pasturelands—three cities.
33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their pasturelands.


34 And to the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, from the tribe of Zebulun: Jokneam with its pasturelands, Kartah with its pasturelands,
35 Dimnah with its pasturelands, and Nahalal with its pasturelands—four cities.
36 And from the tribe of Reuben: Bezer with its pasturelands, Jahaz with its pasturelands,
37 Kedemoth with its pasturelands, and Mephaath with its pasturelands—four cities.
38 And from the tribe of Gad: Ramoth in Gilead, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasturelands, Mahanaim with its pasturelands,
39 Heshbon with its pasturelands, and Jazer with its pasturelands—four cities in all.
40 All these were the cities of the sons of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites, and their lot was twelve cities.


41 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasturelands.
42 These cities had each its surrounding pasturelands; so it was with all these cities.


43 So the LORD gave to Israel all the land that He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they possessed it and lived in it.
44 And the LORD gave them rest on every side, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers, and none of their enemies stood before them; the LORD gave all their enemies into their hand.
45 Not one word of all the good words which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel failed; all came to pass.




Chapter 22


1 Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
2 and said to them, “You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you.
3 You have not forsaken your brothers these many days, down to this day, but have been careful to keep the charge of the LORD your God.
4 And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brothers, as He promised them. So now return and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan.


5 Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you: to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to cling to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.”
6 So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.


7 Now to the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua gave a portion among their brothers west of the Jordan. And when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,
8 and said to them, “Return with great riches to your tents, and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and with much clothing. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.”


9 So the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned and departed from the sons of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they had acquired according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses.


10 When they came to the region of the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a large altar in appearance.


11 The sons of Israel heard it said, “Behold, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the edge of the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the sons of Israel.”
12 When the sons of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered at Shiloh to go up against them in war.


13 Then the sons of Israel sent to the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
14 and ten leaders with him, one leader each from a father’s household of every tribe of Israel; and each one was the head of his father’s household among the thousands of Israel.


15 They came to the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,
16 “Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD: ‘What is this unfaithful act which you have committed against the God of Israel, by turning away today from following the LORD, by building yourselves an altar, to rebel against the LORD this day?


17 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of the LORD,
18 that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? And it will come about that if you rebel against the LORD today, He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel tomorrow.


19 If, however, the land of your possession is unclean, then cross over to the land of the LORD’s possession, where the LORD’s tabernacle stands, and take possession among us. But do not rebel against the LORD, nor rebel against us, by building an altar for yourselves besides the altar of the LORD our God.


20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah act unfaithfully in the matter of the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.’”


21 Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and spoke to the heads of the families of Israel,
22 “The Mighty One, God, the LORD! The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows, and may Israel itself know. If it was in rebellion or in unfaithfulness against the LORD, do not spare us this day.


23 If we have built us an altar to turn away from following the LORD, or to offer burnt offering or grain offering on it, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings on it, may the LORD Himself require it.


24 But truly we have done this out of concern, thinking, ‘In time to come your sons may say to our sons, “What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?


25 For the LORD has made the Jordan river a border between us and you, you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad; you have no portion in the LORD.” So your sons might cause our sons to stop fearing the LORD.’


26 Therefore we said, ‘Let us build an altar, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice,
27 but to be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we are to perform the service of the LORD before Him with our burnt offerings, with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings, so that your sons may not say to our sons in time to come, “You have no portion in the LORD.”’


28 Therefore we said, ‘It shall also come about if they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, then we shall say, “See the copy of the altar of the LORD which our fathers made, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice; rather, it is a witness between us and you.”’


29 Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD and turn away this day from following the LORD, by building an altar for burnt offering, for grain offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of the LORD our God which is before His tabernacle.”


30 When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation, even the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.
31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh, “Today we know that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this unfaithful act against the LORD. Now you have delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of the LORD.”


32 Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned from the sons of Reuben and from the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought back word to them.
33 And the word pleased the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel blessed God, and they did not speak of going up against them in war, to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad were living.


34 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar Witness; “For,” they said, “it is a witness between us that the LORD is God.”




Chapter 23


1 A long time afterward, when the Lord had given rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies, and Joshua had grown old and advanced in years,  
2 Joshua summoned all Israel, its elders, its heads, its judges, and its officers, and said to them, “I am old and advanced in years.  
3 You have seen all that the Lord your God did to all these nations for your sake, for the Lord your God is He who fought for you.  
4 See, I have allotted to you as an inheritance, according to your tribes, these remaining nations, along with all the nations I have cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west.  
5 The Lord your God will thrust them out from before you and drive them out of your sight, and you shall take possession of their land, as the Lord your God promised you.


6 Be very strong, then, to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left,  
7 so that you do not mix with these nations who remain among you. Do not mention the names of their gods or swear by them, serve them, or bow down to them,  
8 but hold fast to the Lord your God, as you have done to this day.  
9 For the Lord has driven out great and mighty nations before you, and as for you, no man has been able to stand against you to this day.  
10 One man of you puts a thousand to flight, for the Lord your God is He who fights for you, just as He promised you.  
11 Therefore, be very careful to love the Lord your God.


12 For if you ever turn back and cling to the remnant of these nations that remain among you, and intermarry with them, associating with them and they with you,  
13 know for certain that the Lord your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they shall be a snare and a trap to you, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land that the Lord your God has given you.


14 And now, today you can see that I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls that not one word has failed of all the good things that the Lord your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one of them has failed.  
15 But just as all the good things that the Lord your God promised you have come upon you, so the Lord will bring upon you all the evil things, until He has destroyed you from off this good land that the Lord your God has given you,  
16 if you transgress the covenant of the Lord your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them. Then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land that He has given to you.




Chapter 24


1 Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officers, and they presented themselves before God.


2 Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Long ago your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates—Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor—and they served other gods.  
3 But I took your father Abraham from beyond the river and led him through all the land of Canaan. I multiplied his offspring and gave him Isaac.  
4 And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.


5 Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in its midst, and afterward I brought you out.  
6 I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea. And the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.  
7 But when they cried out to the LORD, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them. Your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time.


8 I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan, and they fought against you. But I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land when I destroyed them before you.  
9 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam the son of Beor to curse you,  
10 but I would not listen to Balaam. Instead, he blessed you, and I delivered you out of his hand.


11 You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, along with the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and I gave them into your hand.  
12 I sent the hornet before you, and it drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites. It was not by your sword or by your bow.  
13 I gave you a land on which you had not labored and cities that you had not built, and you live in them. You eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.


14 Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and truth. Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the river and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.  
15 But if it seems evil in your eyes to serve the LORD, then choose this day whom you will serve—whether the gods your fathers served beyond the river, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.”


16 Then the people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods.  
17 For it is the LORD our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who performed those great signs in our sight and preserved us all along the way that we went and among all the peoples through whom we passed.  
18 And the LORD drove out before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for He is our God.”


19 But Joshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve the LORD, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God. He will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.  
20 If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume you, after having done you good.”  
21 But the people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve the LORD.”  
22 Then Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD to serve Him.” And they said, “We are witnesses.”  
23 “Now then,” he said, “put away the foreign gods that are among you and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.”  
24 And the people said to Joshua, “The LORD our God we will serve, and His voice we will obey.”


25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set for them a statute and a rule at Shechem.  
26 And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. He took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was near the sanctuary of the LORD.  
27 And Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone will be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD that He spoke to us. It shall be a witness against you, lest you deny your God.”  
28 Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his inheritance.


29 After these things, Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at 110 years of age.  
30 They buried him in his own inheritance at Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.


31 Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the work that the LORD had done for Israel.


32 The bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem, in the portion of land that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver. It became an inheritance for the descendants of Joseph.


33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died, and they buried him at Gibeah, the town of his son Phinehas, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim.﻿Judges


Chapter 1


1 After the death of Joshua, the sons of Israel inquired of the LORD, saying, “Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?”
2 And the LORD said, “Judah shall go up. Behold, I have given the land into his hand.”
3 Then Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I also will go with you into the territory allotted to you.” So Simeon went with him.
4 Judah went up, and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.


5 They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, and fought against him, and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
6 Adoni-bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.
7 And Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.


8 Then the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, and they set the city on fire.
9 Afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negev, and in the lowland.
10 So Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba), and they struck Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
11 From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir (the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher).


12 And Caleb said, “Whoever strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him my daughter Achsah as a wife.”
13 Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it; so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife.
14 When she came to him, she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. She dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”
15 She said to him, “Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.


16 The descendants of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the city of palms with the sons of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the Negev near Arad; and they went and settled with the people there.


17 Then Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah.
18 Judah also captured Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.
19 And the LORD was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country. But he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron.
20 And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak.


21 But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.


22 Likewise, the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
23 The house of Joseph spied out Bethel (the name of the city formerly was Luz).
24 And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the city, and we will treat you kindly.”
25 So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go.
26 And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz, and that is its name to this day.


27 But Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages. So the Canaanites persisted in living in that land.
28 When Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.


29 And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.


30 Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to forced labor.


31 Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon or Ahlab or Achzib or Helbah or Aphik or Rehob.
32 So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.


33 Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them.


34 Then the Amorites pressed the sons of Dan into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the valley.
35 Yet the Amorites persisted in living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; but the hand of the house of Joseph grew heavy, and they became subject to forced labor.
36 The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.




Chapter 2


1 The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land which I swore to your fathers. I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you,
2 and you shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed My voice. What is this you have done?
3 Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.’”


4 When the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept.
5 So they called the name of that place Bochim, and they offered sacrifices there to the LORD.


6 When Joshua had dismissed the people, the sons of Israel each went to his inheritance to possess the land.
7 The people served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the LORD which He had done for Israel.


8 Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of one hundred and ten years.
9 They buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.


10 All that generation also were gathered to their fathers, and another generation arose after them who did not know the LORD, nor the work which He had done for Israel.


11 Then the sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals.
12 They abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them, and they provoked the LORD to anger.
13 They forsook the LORD and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.


14 The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He gave them into the hands of those who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies around them, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.
15 Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, just as the LORD had spoken and just as the LORD had sworn to them, so that they were severely distressed.


16 Then the LORD raised up judges who delivered them from the hands of those who plundered them.
17 Yet they did not listen to their judges either, for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked in obedience to the commandments of the LORD; they did not do what was right.


18 When the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge and saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge, for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed and afflicted them.
19 But it came about that when the judge died, they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, going after other gods to serve them and bow down to them. They did not cease from their practices or from their stubborn ways.


20 So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers and has not listened to My voice,
21 I in turn will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died,
22 in order to test Israel by them, to see whether they will keep the way of the LORD, to walk in it as their fathers did, or not.”
23 So the LORD allowed those nations to remain, not driving them out quickly, and He did not give them into the hand of Joshua.




Chapter 3


1 These are the nations that the LORD left in order to test Israel by them—that is, all who had not known any of the wars in Canaan.
2 He did this only so that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught war—those who had not experienced it before.
3 The five rulers of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.
4 They were left to test Israel by them, to see whether they would obey the commandments of the LORD, which He commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.


5 So the sons of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
6 They took their daughters as wives for themselves and gave their own daughters to their sons, and they served their gods.


7 The sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.
8 Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram-naharaim. The sons of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
9 But when the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the sons of Israel to deliver them—Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
10 The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram into his hand, so that his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.
11 Then the land had rest for forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.


12 Then the sons of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
13 He gathered to himself the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and he went and struck Israel. Then they took possession of the city of palm trees.
14 So the sons of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.


15 But when the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for them—Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon king of Moab.
16 And Ehud made for himself a sword, double-edged, about a cubit in length, and he strapped it under his clothes on his right thigh.
17 He brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
18 When he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute.
19 But he himself turned back at the sculptured stones near Gilgal, and he said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” And he said, “Silence.” So all who were standing around him left.


20 Then Ehud came to him, while he was sitting alone in his cool upper chamber. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” So he rose from his seat.
21 Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.
22 The hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly—and the refuse came out.


23 Then Ehud went out through the vestibule and shut the doors of the upper chamber behind him and locked them.
24 When he had gone out, the servants came, and they saw that the doors of the upper chamber were locked. They said, “He must be relieving himself in the cool room.”
25 They waited until they were embarrassed, but still he did not open the doors of the upper chamber. So they took the key and opened them—and there their lord had fallen to the floor, dead.


26 Now Ehud escaped while they were waiting. He passed the sculptured stones and escaped to Seirah.
27 When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them.
28 He said to them, “Follow me, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to cross over.


29 At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men—not a man escaped.
30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.


31 After him came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He also delivered Israel.




Chapter 4


1 And the sons of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD after Ehud had died.  
2 So the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin, king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth Haggoyim.  
3 Then the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, for he had nine hundred iron chariots and oppressed the sons of Israel cruelly for twenty years.


4 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.  
5 She would sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.  
6 She sent and summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and she said to him, “Has not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you: ‘Go, march to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men from the sons of Naphtali and from the sons of Zebulun?  
7 Then I will draw out to you at the Wadi Kishon Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude, and I will give him into your hand.’”


8 But Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”  
9 She said, “I will certainly go with you. However, the glory will not be yours on the road you are taking, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” Then Deborah rose and went with Barak to Kedesh.  
10 Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up at his feet. Deborah also went up with him.


11 Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.


12 It was reported to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.  
13 So Sisera summoned all his chariots—nine hundred iron chariots—and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Wadi Kishon.


14 Then Deborah said to Barak, “Rise! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. Has not the LORD gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.  
15 And the LORD threw Sisera and all his chariots and all his army into confusion before the edge of the sword of Barak. Sisera dismounted from his chariot and fled on foot.  
16 But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim, and the entire army of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left.


17 Now Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.  
18 Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not be afraid.” So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.  
19 Then he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.  
20 Then he said to her, “Stand at the opening of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you, ‘Is there a man here?’ say, ‘No.’”


21 But Jael, the wife of Heber, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went down into the ground—while he was fast asleep and exhausted—and he died.


22 And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man you are seeking.” So he went in with her, and behold, Sisera was lying dead with the tent peg in his temple.


23 So God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the sons of Israel on that day.  
24 And the hand of the sons of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.




Chapter 5


1 Then Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying:


2 “Because the leaders took the lead in Israel,
    because the men offered themselves willingly,
    bless the Lord!
3 Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes!
    I, to the Lord I will sing;
    I will sing praise to the Lord, the God of Israel.


4 Lord, when you went out from Seir,
    when you marched from the field of Edom,
    the earth trembled, the heavens also poured,
    the clouds indeed poured water.
5 The mountains quaked before the Lord,
    the One of Sinai, before the Lord, the God of Israel.


6 In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,
    in the days of Jael, the highways were deserted,
    and travelers walked by roundabout paths.
7 The warriors ceased; they ceased in Israel
    until I, Deborah, arose;
    I arose as a mother in Israel.
8 They chose new gods;
    then war was at the gates.
    A shield or a spear was not to be seen
    among forty thousand in Israel.


9 My heart is with the commanders of Israel,
    those who offered themselves willingly among the men.
    Bless the Lord!
10 Speak, you who ride on white donkeys,
    you who sit on rich carpets,
    and you who walk along the way.


11 To the sound of the water-drawers between the watering places,
    there they shall recount the righteous acts of the Lord,
    the righteous deeds of his warriors in Israel.
    Then the people of the Lord went down to the gates.


12 Awake, awake, Deborah!
    Awake, awake, speak a song!
    Arise, Barak, and take captive your captors,
    O son of Abinoam.


13 Then the remnant of the nobles went down;
    the people of the Lord went down for me against the mighty.
14 From Ephraim their root came down into Amalek;
    after you, Benjamin, with your kin.
    From Machir commanders came down,
    and from Zebulun those who bear the marshal’s staff.
15 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah;
    as was Issachar, so was Barak;
    into the valley they rushed at his heels.
    Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.


16 Why did you sit among the sheepfolds,
    to hear the piping for the flocks?
    Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
17 Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan;
    and Dan, why did he linger by the ships?
    Asher sat still at the seacoast,
    and remained by his landings.
18 Zebulun is a people who risked their lives to the death,
    and Naphtali also, on the heights of the field.
19 The kings came, they fought;
    then the kings of Canaan fought,
    at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo;
    they took no spoil of silver.


20 From the heavens the stars fought,
    from their courses they fought against Sisera.
21 The torrent Kishon swept them away,
    the ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon.
    March on, O my soul, with strength!


22 Then the horsehooves pounded
    with the galloping, galloping of his mighty ones.
23 ‘Curse Meroz,’ says the angel of the Lord,
    ‘curse bitterly its inhabitants,
    because they did not come to the help of the Lord,
    to the help of the Lord against the mighty.’


24 Most blessed of women is Jael,
    the wife of Heber the Kenite,
    of tent-dwelling women most blessed.
25 He asked for water, and she gave him milk;
    in a princely bowl she brought him curds.
26 She reached out her hand for the tent peg,
    and her right hand for the workmen’s mallet;
    she struck Sisera, she crushed his head,
    she shattered and pierced his temple.
27 Between her feet he sank, he fell, he lay;
    between her feet he sank, he fell;
    where he sank, there he fell—destroyed.
28 Through the window she looked out and cried,
    the mother of Sisera, through the lattice:
    ‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?
    Why tarry the hoofbeats of his chariots?’
29 Her wisest ladies answer her,
    indeed, she repeats the words to herself,
30 ‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoil?
    A girl, two girls for every man;
    spoil of dyed cloth for Sisera,
    spoil of dyed cloth embroidered,
    dyed cloth embroidered for the neck as spoil?’


31 So may all your enemies perish, O Lord!
    But may those who love you be like the rising of the sun in its might.


And the land had rest forty years.




Chapter 6


1 The sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of Midian for seven years.  
2 The hand of Midian prevailed over Israel. Because of Midian, the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens which are in the mountains, as well as the caves and strongholds.  
3 For whenever Israel sowed, the Midianites, Amalekites, and the sons of the east would go up against them.  
4 They would camp against them and destroy the produce of the land as far as Gaza, and they would leave no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor donkey.  
5 For they came up with their livestock and their tents; they came like a swarm of locusts in number—both they and their camels were without number—and they came into the land to devastate it.  
6 So Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD.


7 When the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD because of Midian,  
8 the LORD sent a prophet to the sons of Israel. He said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of slavery.  
9 I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all your oppressors. I drove them out from before you and gave you their land.  
10 And I said to you, ‘I am the LORD your God. You shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.’ But you have not obeyed my voice.”


11 Then the angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites.  
12 The angel of the LORD appeared to him and said, “The LORD is with you, mighty warrior.”  
13 But Gideon said to him, “Please, my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His wondrous deeds which our fathers told us about, saying, ‘Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the LORD has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.”  
14 And the LORD turned to him and said, “Go in this strength of yours and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?”  
15 He said to Him, “Please, my lord, how shall I deliver Israel? Look, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.”  
16 The LORD said to him, “But I will be with you, and you shall strike down Midian as one man.”  
17 Then he said to Him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is You who speak with me.  
18 Please do not depart from here until I come back to You and bring out my offering and set it before You.” And He said, “I will stay until you return.”


19 So Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and he brought them out to Him under the oak and presented them.  
20 The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And he did so.  
21 Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. Fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.  
22 When Gideon saw that it was the angel of the LORD, he said, “Alas, O Lord GOD! For I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.”  
23 But the LORD said to him, “Peace be with you. Do not fear; you shall not die.”  
24 Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and called it, “The LORD is Peace.” To this day it still stands at Ophrah of the Abiezrites.


25 That night the LORD said to him, “Take your father’s bull, and the second bull seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal which belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it.  
26 Then build an altar to the LORD your God on top of this stronghold, in an orderly manner, and take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down.”  
27 So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his father's household and the men of the city to do it by day, he did it at night.


28 When the men of the city got up early in the morning, they saw that the altar of Baal was torn down, the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull had been offered on the altar that had been built.  
29 And they said to one another, “Who did this thing?” After they investigated and inquired, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash did this thing.”  
30 Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, so that he may die, for he has torn down the altar of Baal and indeed cut down the Asherah beside it.”  
31 But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, since someone has torn down his altar.”  
32 Therefore on that day he was called Jerubbaal, saying, “Let Baal contend against him,” because he had torn down his altar.


33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east assembled together, and they crossed over and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.  
34 But the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, and he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called to follow him.  
35 He sent messengers throughout all of Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.


36 Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to deliver Israel by my hand, as You have said,  
37 then see how I am placing a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If dew is on the fleece alone, and all the ground is dry, then I shall know that You will deliver Israel by my hand, as You have said.”  
38 And it was so. When he got up early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water.  
39 Then Gideon said to God, “Do not let Your anger burn against me. Let me speak just once more. Please let me make just one more test with the fleece: let it now be dry only on the fleece, and let there be dew on all the ground.”  
40 And God did so that night: it was dry only on the fleece, and there was dew on all the ground.




Chapter 7


1 Early in the morning, Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him set up camp beside the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was to the north of them, near the hill of Moreh in the valley.


2 Then the LORD said to Gideon, “The people with you are too many for Me to give Midian into their hand, lest Israel boast against Me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’
3 Now therefore proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home and leave Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.


4 But the LORD said to Gideon, “The people are still too many. Bring them down to the water, and I will refine them for you there. And it shall be that of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go with you; but of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.”
5 So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart by himself. Likewise, everyone who kneels down to drink.”
6 The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men, while all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water.


7 And the LORD said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men who lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hand. Let all the others go, each to his home.”
8 So the people took provisions in their hands, and their trumpets. He sent all the men of Israel, every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.


9 That same night the LORD said to him, “Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand.
10 But if you are afraid to go down, go down with Purah your servant
11 and listen to what they say; afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down against the camp.” Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men who were in the camp.
12 Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley, as numerous as locusts. And their camels were without number, as many as the sand on the seashore.


13 When Gideon came, he encountered a man recounting a dream to his companion. The man said, “Listen to this, I had a dream, and in it a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down, so that the tent collapsed.”
14 And his companion answered and said, “This is nothing but the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has given Midian and all the camp into his hand.”


15 When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped. Then he returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for the LORD has given the camp of Midian into your hand.”
16 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies and placed trumpets into the hands of all of them, along with empty jars, with torches inside the jars.
17 And he said to them, “Watch me and do likewise. When I come to the edge of the camp, do as I do.
18 When I blow the trumpet—I and all who are with me—then you also blow the trumpets on every side of all the camp and shout, ‘For the LORD and for Gideon!’”


19 So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch. Then they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands.
20 The three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars. They held in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands blew the trumpets. And they cried out, “A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!”


21 Each man stood in his place all around the camp, and all the army panicked, cried out and fled.
22 When the three hundred trumpets were blown, the LORD set every man's sword against his companion throughout the whole army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, near Tabbath.


23 And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian.
24 Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters ahead of them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.” So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they seized the waters as far as Beth-barah and also the Jordan.
25 And they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. Then they pursued Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan.




Chapter 8


1 Then the men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight Midian?” And they contended fiercely with him.
2 But he said to them, “What have I done today compared to you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
3 God has given the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, into your hand. What was I able to do compared to you?” Then their anger toward him subsided when he said this.


4 Then Gideon came to the Jordan river and, crossing over—he and the three hundred men who were with him—he was exhausted, yet still in pursuit.
5 So he said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.”
6 But the leaders of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?”
7 So Gideon said, “Very well. When the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will flay your flesh with thorns of the wilderness and with briers.”
8 From there he went up to Penuel and spoke similarly to them, and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
9 So he also said to the men of Penuel, “When I return in peace, I will tear down this tower.”


10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their army with them, about fifteen thousand men—all who were left of the entire army of the people of the east—for a hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen.
11 And Gideon went up by the route of those who dwell in tents east of Nobah and Jogbehah and struck the army, for the army was off guard.
12 Zebah and Zalmunna fled, but he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he terrified the whole army.


13 Then Gideon, son of Joash, returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.
14 And he captured a young man from the men of Succoth and questioned him. The young man wrote down for him the names of the leaders of Succoth and its elders—seventy-seven men.
15 So he came to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you mocked me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your exhausted men?’”
16 Then he took the elders of the city, and with thorns of the wilderness and with briers he taught the men of Succoth a lesson.
17 And he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.


18 Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?” And they said, “As you are, so were they; each one looked like a king’s son.”
19 He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if you had kept them alive, I would not kill you.”
20 Then he said to Jether his firstborn, “Rise, kill them.” But the boy did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, since he was still a boy.
21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise yourself and strike us, for as the man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon rose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.


22 Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you, your son, and your grandson also—for you have saved us from the hand of Midian.”
23 But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the LORD will rule over you.”
24 Then Gideon said to them, “Let me make a request of you: that each of you give me an earring from his spoil.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
25 And they said, “We will willingly give them.” So they spread out a cloak, and every man threw into it an earring from his spoil.
26 The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold, apart from the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and apart from the collars that were on the necks of their camels.
27 Gideon made it into an ephod and placed it in his city, in Ophrah. And all Israel prostituted themselves after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his household.


28 So Midian was subdued before the sons of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.


29 Then Jerubbaal son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
30 Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, for he had many wives.
31 And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.
32 Then Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.


33 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon died, that the sons of Israel again prostituted themselves after the Baals and made Baal-berith their god.
34 And the sons of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their enemies on every side,
35 nor did they show loyalty to the house of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, in return for all the good that he had done to Israel.




Chapter 9


1 Abimelek son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, to his mother’s brothers, and spoke to them and to the whole clan of his mother’s family, saying,  
2 “Please speak in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem: ‘Which is better for you—that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or that one man rule over you?’ And remember that I am your own flesh and bone.”  
3 So his mother’s relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem, and their hearts inclined toward Abimelek, for they said, “He is our brother.”  
4 They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-berith, with which Abimelek hired worthless and reckless men, and they followed him.  
5 He went to his father’s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal—seventy men—on one stone. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, for he hid himself.  
6 Then all the leaders of Shechem and all Beth-millo gathered together, and they went and made Abimelek king, beside the oak of the pillar that is in Shechem.


7 When Jotham was told, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim and raised his voice and called out. He said to them, “Listen to me, leaders of Shechem, that God may listen to you.  
8 The trees once went out to anoint a king over themselves, and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’  
9 But the olive tree said to them, ‘Shall I give up my fatness, by which gods and men are honored, and go rule over the trees?’  
10 Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and reign over us.’  
11 But the fig tree said to them, ‘Shall I give up my sweetness and my good fruit and go rule over the trees?’  
12 Then the trees said to the vine, ‘You come and reign over us.’  
13 But the vine said to them, ‘Shall I give up my wine that cheers gods and men and go rule over the trees?’  
14 Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and reign over us.’  
15 And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you are anointing me as king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out from the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’


16 “So now, if you have acted in truth and integrity in making Abimelek king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house and have done to him as his hands deserved—  
17 for my father fought for you and risked his life and rescued you from the hand of Midian,  
18 but today you have risen against my father’s house and killed his sons—seventy men on one stone—and made Abimelek, the son of his maidservant, king over the leaders of Shechem because he is your brother—  
19 if, then, you have acted in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, rejoice in Abimelek, and let him also rejoice in you.  
20 But if not, may fire come out from Abimelek and devour the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo, and may fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo and devour Abimelek.”  
21 Then Jotham fled and ran away and went to Beer, and he lived there out of fear of his brother Abimelek.


22 Abimelek ruled over Israel for three years.  
23 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelek and the leaders of Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelek,  
24 in order that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be avenged, and their blood laid upon Abimelek their brother, who killed them, and on the leaders of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.  
25 The leaders of Shechem set ambushers against him on the mountaintops, and they robbed all who passed by them along the road. And it was reported to Abimelek.


26 Now Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers came and moved into Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem put their confidence in him.  
27 They went out into the field, harvested their vineyards, trod the grapes, and held a festival. They went into the house of their god, ate and drank, and cursed Abimelek.  
28 Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelek, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem! Why should we serve him?  
29 If only this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelek.” And he said to Abimelek, “Gather your army and come out!”


30 When Zebul the governor of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.  
31 He secretly sent messengers to Abimelek, saying, “Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem, and they are stirring up the city against you.  
32 Now, therefore, arise by night, you and the men with you, and lie in wait in the field.  
33 In the morning, as soon as the sun is up, rise early and rush upon the city; and when he and the men with him come out against you, do to him as your hand finds to do.”  
34 So Abimelek and all the men who were with him rose by night and laid in wait against Shechem in four companies.  
35 Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, and Abimelek and the men with him arose from the ambush.  
36 When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, men are coming down from the mountaintops.” But Zebul said to him, “You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.”  
37 Gaal spoke again and said, “Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners’ Oak.”  
38 Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your mouth now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimelek that we should serve him?’ Are not these the people you despised? Go out now and fight with them.”  
39 So Gaal went out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelek.  
40 Abimelek chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate.  
41 Abimelek stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers so that they could not stay in Shechem.


42 On the next day the people went out into the field, and it was reported to Abimelek.  
43 He took his men, divided them into three companies, and set an ambush in the field. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose against them and struck them.  
44 Abimelek and the company with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the city gate, while the two other companies rushed upon all who were in the field and struck them.  
45 Abimelek fought against the city all that day. He captured the city, killed the people who were in it, razed the city, and sowed it with salt.


46 When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the house of El-berith.  
47 It was told to Abimelek that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together.  
48 Abimelek went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the men who were with him, and Abimelek took an axe in his hand, cut down a tree branch, lifted it, and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the men with him, “What you saw me do, hurry and do likewise.”  
49 So all the men also cut down a branch each, and followed Abimelek. They placed them against the stronghold and set the stronghold on fire above them, so that all the men of the Tower of Shechem also died—about a thousand men and women.


50 Then Abimelek went to Thebez and camped against Thebez and captured it.  
51 But there was a strong tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women and all the leaders of the city fled there and shut themselves in. They went up to the roof of the tower.  
52 Abimelek came to the tower and fought against it. He approached the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire,  
53 but a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelek’s head and crushed his skull.  
54 Then he called quickly to the young man who carried his armor and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, so they will not say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So his young man thrust him through, and he died.  
55 When the men of Israel saw that Abimelek was dead, they each went home.


56 Thus God repaid the evil of Abimelek, which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers.  
57 And God also repaid all the evil of the men of Shechem on their heads, and the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal came upon the




Chapter 10


1 Now after Abimelek, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to deliver Israel. He dwelt in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim. 2 He judged Israel for twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir.


3 After him arose Jair the Gileadite, and he judged Israel for twenty-two years. 4 He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty towns, which are called Havvoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead. 5 Jair died and was buried in Kamon.


6 Then the sons of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. They forsook the LORD and did not serve Him. 7 So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the sons of Ammon. 8 That year they crushed and oppressed the sons of Israel for eighteen years—all the sons of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. 9 The sons of Ammon also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed.


10 Then the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, “We have sinned against You, for we have truly forsaken our God and served the Baals.” 11 But the LORD said to the sons of Israel, “Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the sons of Ammon, and the Philistines? 12 Also when the Sidonians, Amalek, and Maon oppressed you and you cried out to Me, did I not save you from their hand? 13 Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods; therefore, I will not deliver you again. 14 Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress.”


15 Then the sons of Israel said to the LORD, “We have sinned. Do to us whatever seems good in Your sight; only please deliver us this day.” 16 So they removed the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD. And His soul could no longer bear the misery of Israel.


17 Then the sons of Ammon were summoned and camped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel gathered themselves and camped in Mizpah. 18 The people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”




Chapter 11


1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior. He was the son of a prostitute, and Gilead was his father.
2 But Gilead’s wife bore him sons, and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah away. They said to him, “You shall not inherit in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.”
3 So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob, and worthless men gathered around Jephthah and went out with him.


4 After some time had passed, the Ammonites made war against Israel.
5 And when the Ammonites fought against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob.
6 They said to Jephthah, “Come and be our leader, so that we may fight against the Ammonites.”
7 But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me and drive me from my father’s house? Why then have you come to me now when you are in distress?”
8 And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “That is why we have now turned to you, so that you may go with us, fight against the Ammonites, and be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
9 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me back to fight against the Ammonites, and the LORD gives them into my hand, then I will be your head.”
10 And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The LORD shall be witness between us—surely we will do as you have said.”
11 So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and leader over them. And Jephthah made vows before the LORD at Mizpah.


12 Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying, “What is there between you and me, that you have come to me to make war against my land?”
13 And the king of the Ammonites said to Jephthah’s messengers, “Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt—from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan river. Now therefore restore those lands peacefully.”
14 Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites,
15 and said to him, “Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.
16 For when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.
17 Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Let us pass through your land,’ but the king of Edom would not listen. They also sent to the king of Moab, but he refused. So Israel remained at Kadesh.


18 Then they journeyed through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab and came to the east side of the land of Moab, and they camped beyond the Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
19 Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, ‘Let us pass through your land to our place.’
20 But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people and camped at Jahaz, and fought with Israel.
21 And the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them. So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, who lived in that region.
22 And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan river.


23 So then, the LORD, the God of Israel, drove out the Amorites before His people Israel, and will you now possess them?
24 Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whatever the LORD our God has dispossessed before us, we will possess.
25 Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel? Did he ever fight against them?
26 While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are along the Arnon, for three hundred years, why did you not recover them during that time?
27 Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by making war on me. Let the LORD, the Judge, decide today between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.”


28 But the king of the Ammonites did not listen to the words that Jephthah sent to him.


29 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh and passed on to Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed on to the sons of Ammon.
30 And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said, “If You will indeed give the sons of Ammon into my hand,
31 then whatever comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon shall be the LORD’s, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.”


32 So Jephthah crossed over to the sons of Ammon to fight against them, and the LORD gave them into his hand.
33 And he struck them from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith—twenty cities—and as far as Abel-keramim, with a very great slaughter. So the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel.


34 Then Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. She was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
35 And when he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you have become the cause of great trouble for me. For I have made a vow to the LORD, and I cannot take it back.”
36 And she said to him, “My father, you have made a vow to the LORD; do to me according to what you promised, since the LORD has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, the sons of Ammon.”
37 Then she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone for two months, that I may go up and down on the mountains and weep over my virginity, I and my companions.”
38 So he said, “Go.” And he sent her away for two months, and she departed—she and her companions—and wept over her virginity on the mountains.
39 And at the end of two months she returned to her father, and he did to her according to the vow he had made. She had never known a man. So it became a custom in Israel
40 that the daughters of Israel went year by year to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.




Chapter 12


1 Then the men of Ephraim were summoned, and they crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight against the sons of Ammon and not call us to go with you? We will burn your house down with fire over you!”


2 But Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were in a serious conflict with the sons of Ammon, and I called you for help, but you did not deliver me from their hand.
3 When I saw that you would not deliver me, I risked my own life and crossed over against the sons of Ammon, and the LORD gave them into my hand. So why have you come up to me this day to fight against me?”


4 Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, “You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim—living in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh.”


5 The Gileadites seized the fords of the Jordan opposite Ephraim, and whenever a fugitive of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead would say to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,”
6 then they would say to him, “Please say Shibboleth.” But he would say, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce it correctly. Then they would seize him and slaughter him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time forty-two thousand of Ephraim fell.


7 Jephthah judged Israel for six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the towns of Gilead.


8 After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
9 He had thirty sons and thirty daughters; he gave his daughters in marriage outside the clan and brought in thirty daughters from outside for his sons. He judged Israel for seven years.
10 Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.


11 After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel for ten years.
12 Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.


13 After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys. He judged Israel for eight years.
15 Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.




Chapter 13


1 And the sons of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.


2 Now there was a certain man from Zorah, from the clan of the Danites, and his name was Manoah. His wife was barren and had borne no children.  
3 And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “Behold now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and bear a son.  
4 Now therefore, be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean.  
5 For it will happen that you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”  
6 Then the woman went to her husband and said, “A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like that of the angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him where he was from, and he did not tell me his name.  
7 But he said to me, ‘It will happen that you shall conceive and bear a son. So now, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.’”


8 Then Manoah entreated the LORD and said, “Please, O Lord, let the man of God whom You sent come again to us and teach us what we should do for the boy who is to be born.”  
9 And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was sitting in the field, but Manoah, her husband, was not with her.  
10 So the woman hurried and ran and told her husband, “Come quickly, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me!”  
11 Then Manoah got up and went after his wife and came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to the woman?” And he said, “I am.”  
12 And Manoah said, “Now, when your words come to pass, what shall be the rule for the boy and his manner of life?”  
13 And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Let the woman be careful concerning all that I said to her.  
14 She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean. She must observe all that I commanded her.”


15 Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “Please let us detain you, so that we may prepare a young goat for you.”  
16 But the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Though you detain me, I will not eat your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD.” (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD.)  
17 And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “What is your name, so that when your words come to pass, we may honor you?”  
18 But the angel of the LORD said to him, “Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?”  
19 So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering and offered it on the rock to the LORD, and He performed wonders as Manoah and his wife looked on.  
20 For it came about, when the flame went up from the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell on their faces to the ground.  
21 Now the angel of the LORD did not appear again to Manoah or his wife. Then Manoah knew that it was the angel of the LORD.


22 And Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, for we have seen God.”  
23 But his wife said to him, “If the LORD had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things, nor let us hear such things as these at this time.”


24 Then the woman gave birth to a son and called his name Samson. And the boy grew, and the LORD blessed him.  
25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.




Chapter 14


1 Samson went down to Timnah, and he saw a woman there among the daughters of the Philistines.
2 So he went up and told his father and mother, “I saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines. Now get her for me as a wife.”


3 But his father and mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she is right in my eyes.”
4 Now his father and mother did not know that this was from the LORD, for He was seeking an occasion against the Philistines; for at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.


5 Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and when they reached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him.
6 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and though he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion apart as one tears a young goat. But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.


7 Then he went down and spoke to the woman, and she was right in Samson’s eyes.
8 After some days he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm of bees was in the body of the lion, and honey.
9 So he scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate, but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion.


10 Then his father went down to the woman, and Samson held a feast there, as was customary for the young men.
11 When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.


12 Samson said to them, “Let me now put a riddle to you. If you can explain it to me within the seven days of the feast and solve it, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.
13 But if you cannot explain it to me, then you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.” And they said to him, “Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.”


14 So he said to them,  
“Out of the eater came something to eat,  
and out of the strong came something sweet.”  
But they could not solve the riddle for three days.


15 Then on the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, so that he will explain the riddle to us, or we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Did you invite us here to impoverish us?”


16 So Samson’s wife wept before him and said, “You surely hate me; you do not love me! You have posed a riddle to the sons of my people, but you have not explained it to me.” But he said to her, “Look, I haven’t even explained it to my father or mother—why should I explain it to you?”
17 But she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she explained the riddle to the sons of her people.


18 So on the seventh day, before he went into the bridal chamber, the men of the city said to him,  
“What is sweeter than honey?  
And what is stronger than a lion?”  
And he said to them,  
“If you had not plowed with my heifer,  
you would not have solved my riddle.”


19 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck down thirty men of them, took their spoil, and gave the sets of clothing to those who had explained the riddle. And his anger burned, and he went up to his father’s house.
20 But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.




Chapter 15


1 Some time later, during the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife, bringing a young goat. He said, “I want to go to my wife in her room.” But her father would not let him enter.
2 Her father said, “I really thought you thoroughly hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Isn't her younger sister more beautiful? Please take her instead.”


3 But Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm.”
4 So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes. He took torches, tied the foxes tail to tail, and placed one torch between each pair of tails.
5 Then he set fire to the torches and released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the shocks, the standing grain, the vineyards, and the olive groves.


6 When the Philistines asked, “Who did this?” they were told, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion.” So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire.


7 Then Samson said to them, “If this is how you act, I will not stop until I have taken revenge on you.”
8 And he struck them down with a great slaughter, then went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock at Etam.


9 Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah, spreading out in Lehi.
10 The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” They answered, “We have come up to capture Samson, and do to him what he did to us.”


11 So three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock at Etam and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? What have you done to us?” He said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”


12 They said to him, “We have come down to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.” Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you yourselves will not attack me.”


13 They said to him, “No, we will only tie you up and give you into their hand. We will not kill you.” So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.


14 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. Then the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that has caught fire, and the bindings melted from his hands.
15 Noticing a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he reached out and took it, then struck down a thousand men with it.
16 Then Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, heap upon heap, with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck down a thousand men.”
17 When he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone from his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.


18 Then he became very thirsty and called upon the LORD and said, “You have granted this great deliverance by the hand of your servant, and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?”
19 So God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out of it. He drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the place was named En-hakkore, which is at Lehi to this day.


20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines for twenty years.




Chapter 16


1 Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw a prostitute and went in to her.  
2 The Gazites were told, “Samson has come here,” so they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They kept quiet all night, saying, “At morning light we will kill him.”  
3 But Samson lay until midnight, and at midnight he arose, took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two gateposts, pulled them up, bar and all, put them on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill that is before Hebron.


4 After this he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.  
5 And the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said, “Entice him, and see where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to subdue him. And we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”  
6 So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies, and how you might be bound to be subdued.”  
7 Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, then I shall become weak and be like any other man.”  
8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she bound him with them.  
9 Now she had men lying in ambush in an inner chamber. And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he snapped the bowstrings as a strand of flax snaps when it touches fire. So the secret of his strength was not revealed.


10 Then Delilah said to Samson, “Hey, you have mocked me and told me lies! Please tell me how you may be bound.”  
11 He said to her, “If they bind me with new ropes that have never been used, then I shall become weak and be like any other man.”  
12 So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And the men lying in ambush were in the inner chamber. But he snapped them off his arms like a thread.


13 Then Delilah said to Samson, “Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me how you may be bound.” And he said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head into loom and fasten it with the pin, then I shall become weak and be like any other man.”  
14 So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into a loom. Then she fastened it with the pin and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he awoke from his sleep and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the weave.


15 And she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times and have not told me where your great strength lies.”  
16 And it came about, when she pressed him hard with her words day after day and urged him, that his soul was vexed to the point of death.  
17 And he finally told her everything and said to her, “A razor has never come upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak and be like any other man.”


18 When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up once more, for he has told me everything.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hands.  
19 She made him sleep on her knees, and she called a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him.  
20 And she said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he awoke from his sleep and said, “I will go out as at other times and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him.


21 Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes. And they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains. And he ground at the mill in the prison.  
22 But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.


23 Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice. And they said, “Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand.”  
24 And when the people saw him, they praised their god, for they said, “Our god has given our enemy into our hand, the destroyer of our land, who has killed many of us.”


25 And it came about, when their hearts were merry, that they said, “Call Samson, that he may entertain us.” So they called Samson from the prison, and he entertained them. They made him stand between the pillars.  
26 And Samson said to the young man who held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them.”  
27 Now the house was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines were there, and on the roof there were about three thousand men and women who looked on while Samson entertained.


28 Then Samson called to the LORD and said, “O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray, and strengthen me just this once, O God, that I may be avenged on the Philistines for my two eyes.”  
29 And Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and he leaned his weight against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other.  
30 And Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines.” Then he bowed with all his strength, and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those he had killed during his life.


31 Then his brothers and all his father’s household came down and took him, and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel for twenty years.




Chapter 17


1 There was a man from the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.
2 He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse and spoke of it in my hearing—look, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said, “May you be blessed by the LORD, my son.”


3 So he returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother. Then his mother said, “I dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a cast idol. So now I will return it to you.”


4 When he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into a carved image and a cast idol. And it was in Micah’s house.
5 Now the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household gods, and he ordained one of his sons, who became his priest.


6 In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.


7 Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, from the tribe of Judah. He was a Levite and was sojourning there.
8 The man left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to find a place to stay wherever he might. As he traveled, he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah.


9 Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am traveling to find a place to stay.”


10 Micah said to him, “Stay with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, a set of clothes, and your provisions.” So the Levite went in.


11 The Levite agreed to stay with the man, and the young man became like one of his sons.
12 Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in Micah’s house.
13 Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, since I have a Levite as priest.”




Chapter 18


1 In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in, for until that day no inheritance had fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.  
2 So the sons of Dan sent out five men from their whole number, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it. And they said to them, “Go and explore the land.” And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and spent the night there.  
3 When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite, so they turned aside and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?”  
4 He said to them, “Thus and so Micah has done for me—he has hired me and I have become his priest.”  
5 And they said to him, “Please inquire of God, that we may know whether the way we are going will succeed.”  
6 And the priest said to them, “Go in peace. The LORD is watching over your journey.”


7 Then the five men went on and came to Laish. They saw that the people who were in it lived securely, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing in the land and possessing wealth. They were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone.  
8 When they came back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, “What did you find?”  
9 And they said, “Arise, let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Will you sit still? Do not delay to go, to enter and possess the land.  
10 When you go, you will come to a people living securely, and the land is spacious. For God has given it into your hand—a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.”


11 So six hundred men from the clan of the Danites set out from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war.  
12 They went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day; it is west of Kiriath-jearim.  
13 From there they passed on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.


14 Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish said to their brothers, “Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, household gods, a carved image, and a cast image? Now therefore, consider what you will do.”  
15 They turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite at the home of Micah and greeted him.  
16 Now the six hundred men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood at the entrance of the gate.  
17 And the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up and entered there. They took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the cast image, while the priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed for war.  
18 When these went into Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the cast image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”  
19 They said to him, “Be quiet. Put your hand over your mouth and come with us. Be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?”  
20 And the priest’s heart was glad. He took the ephod, the household gods, and the carved image and went along with the people.


21 They turned and departed, placing the little ones, the livestock, and the goods in front of them.  
22 When they had gone some distance from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house were called out, and they overtook the sons of Dan.  
23 They shouted to the sons of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, “What is the matter with you, that you have assembled together?”  
24 And he said, “You took away my gods that I made, and the priest, and went away, and what do I have left? How then do you say to me, ‘What is the matter with you?’”  
25 And the sons of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry men fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household.”  
26 Then the sons of Dan went on their way, and Micah saw that they were too strong for him. So he turned and went back to his house.


27 But they took what Micah had made, and the priest who had belonged to him, and they came to Laish, to a quiet and unsuspecting people. They struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.  
28 There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the city and lived in it.  
29 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel. But the name of the city was formerly Laish.


30 And the sons of Dan set up for themselves the carved image. And Jonathan the son of Gershom, son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.  
31 So they set up for themselves the carved image that Micah had made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.




Chapter 19


1 Now in those days, when there was no king in Israel, there was a certain Levite residing as a foreigner in the remote areas of the hill country of Ephraim. He took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.  
2 But his concubine was unfaithful to him and left him, going to her father's house in Bethlehem of Judah, where she stayed for four months.  
3 Then her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a pair of donkeys. When he arrived at her father’s house, the young woman brought him into the house, and her father rejoiced to meet him.  
4 His father-in-law, the young woman’s father, persuaded him to stay, and he remained with him three days. They ate, drank, and lodged there.  
5 On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning, and he prepared to leave. But the young woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh yourself with a bit of food, and afterward you may go.”  
6 So the two of them sat down, and they ate and drank together. Then the young woman’s father said, “Please, be willing to stay overnight and let your heart be merry.”  
7 When the man stood up to leave, his father-in-law urged him, and he spent the night there again.  
8 On the fifth day, he arose early in the morning to leave. But the young woman’s father said, “Refresh yourself.” So they delayed until the day was far gone, and the two of them ate together.  
9 When the man got up to leave—he, his concubine, and his servant—his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said to him, “Look, the day has drawn to a close. Please spend the night. Look, the day is coming to an end. Stay here tonight and let your heart be merry. Tomorrow you can get up early and go on your way home.”  
10 But the man was unwilling to stay another night. So he rose and departed, and came to a place opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his pair of saddled donkeys and his concubine with him.  
11 As they were near Jebus, the day was nearly gone. The servant said to his master, “Come now, let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it.”  
12 But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside into a city of foreigners, who are not of the sons of Israel; we will pass on to Gibeah.”  
13 And he said to his servant, “Come, let us approach one of these places, and we will spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah.”  
14 So they passed on and went their way, and the sun set upon them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.  
15 They turned aside there to go in and lodge at Gibeah. When he entered, he sat down in the open square of the city, for no man took them into his house to spend the night.  
16 Then behold, an old man was coming in from his work in the field that evening. He was also from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was residing in Gibeah, but the men of the place were Benjaminites.  
17 When he looked up and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man said, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?”  
18 And he said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, from which I am. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and now I am going to the house of the LORD, but no man has taken me into his house.  
19 We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, your servant, and for the young woman and the servant who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything.”  
20 The old man said, “Peace be to you. I will take care of all your needs—only do not spend the night in the square.”  
21 So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys fodder. Then they washed their feet, ate, and drank.


22 While they were enjoying themselves, behold, certain worthless men of the city surrounded the house. They pounded on the door and said to the old man, the master of the house, “Bring out the man who came into your house so we can have relations with him.”  
23 The man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. Since this man has come into my house, do not do this disgraceful thing.  
24 Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. Let me bring them out to you now; abuse them and do to them whatever you please. But do not commit such an outrageous act against this man.”  
25 But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and brought her out to them. They raped her and abused her all night until morning. At dawn, they let her go.  
26 As morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the entrance of the man’s house where her master was, and lay there until it was light.  
27 Her master arose in the morning, opened the doors of the house, and went out to go on his way. And behold, the woman, his concubine, was lying at the entrance of the house, with her hands on the threshold.  
28 He said to her, “Get up, let us go.” But there was no answer. So he placed her on the donkey, and the man rose up and went to his home.


29 When he entered his house, he took a knife and laid hold of his concubine. He cut her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.  
30 And everyone who saw it said, “Nothing like this has happened or been seen from the day the sons of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day. Consider it, take counsel, and speak.” 




Chapter 20


1 Then all the sons of Israel went out, and the congregation assembled as one man  to the LORD at Mizpah, coming from Dan to Beersheba, including from the land of Gilead.
2 And the chiefs of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, took their stand in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand men on foot who drew the sword.
3 (Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, "Tell us, how did this evil happen?"


4 So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered and said, "I came with my concubine to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to spend the night.
5 And the masters of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house against me by night; they thought to kill me, and they violated my concubine so that she died.
6 Then I took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel’s inheritance, because they committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel.
7 And now, all you sons of Israel, give here your counsel and advice."


8 So all the people rose as one man, saying, "Not one of us will go to his tent, and not one of us will turn aside to his house.
9 But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot.
10 And we will take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to provide provisions for the people, that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may repay all the disgrace which they have committed in Israel."
11 In this way, all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one man.


12 Then the tribes of Israel sent men throughout the entire tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What is this wickedness that has taken place among you?
13 Now then, deliver up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove evil from Israel." But the sons of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the sons of Israel.
14 And the sons of Benjamin gathered from the cities to Gibeah to go out to battle against the sons of Israel.
15 From the cities, on that day, the sons of Benjamin were mustered: twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, apart from the inhabitants of Gibeah, who mustered seven hundred choice men.
16 Among all these were seven hundred choice men left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.


17 Then the men of Israel, apart from Benjamin, were mustered: four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of them men of war.


18 And the sons of Israel arose and went up to Bethel, and inquired of God, saying, "Who shall go up first for us to battle against the sons of Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Judah first."
19 So the sons of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.
20 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel arranged for battle against them at Gibeah.


21 Then the sons of Benjamin came out from Gibeah and struck down on that day twenty-two thousand men of Israel to the ground.
22 But the people, the men of Israel, strengthened themselves and again formed the battle line in the place where they had formed it the first day.
23 And the sons of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall we again draw near for battle against our brothers, the sons of Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Go up against him."


24 So the sons of Israel came near to the sons of Benjamin on the second day.
25 And Benjamin went out from Gibeah against them the second day and struck down to the ground again eighteen thousand men of the sons of Israel; all these drew the sword.


26 Then all the sons of Israel, and all the people, went up and came to Bethel and wept, and they sat there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening. And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
27 And the sons of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
28 and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it to minister in those days), saying, "Shall we yet again go out to battle against our brothers, the sons of Benjamin, or shall we cease?" And the LORD said, "Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand."


29 So Israel set men in ambush against Gibeah all around.
30 And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as at other times.


31 And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city, and they began to strike and kill some of the people as at other times on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the field about thirty men of Israel.
32 And the sons of Benjamin said, "They are struck down before us as at the first." But the sons of Israel said, "Let us flee so that we may draw them away from the city to the highways."


33 Then all the men of Israel rose from their place and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar, and the men of Israel in ambush rushed out of their place from Maareh-geba.
34 And ten thousand choice men from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce; but the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was close upon them.
35 And the LORD struck Benjamin before Israel, and the sons of Israel destroyed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of Benjamin that day; all of these drew the sword.
36 So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. When the men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin because they trusted in the ambush which they had set against Gibeah,
37 the ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; and the ambush drew up and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword.


38 Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise from the city.
39 When the men of Israel turned in battle, Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel, for they said, "Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle."


40 But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, Benjamin looked behind them, and they saw the whole city was going up in smoke to heaven.
41 Then the men of Israel turned back, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, for they saw that disaster had overtaken them.
42 Therefore they turned before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them, and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them.


43 They surrounded Benjamin, pursued them without rest, and trod them down opposite Gibeah toward the east.
44 Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all of these were valiant warriors.
45 Then they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, but they gleaned five thousand men of them on the highways and overtook them at Gidom and struck down two thousand men of them.


46 So all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were valiant men.
47 But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months.
48 And the men of Israel turned back against the sons of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the men of every city and the cattle and all that was found. Also they set on fire all the cities which they found.




Chapter 21


1 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, “None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.”  
2 So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.  
3 And they said, “O LORD, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that one tribe should be missing today from Israel?”  
4 And it came about the next day that the people rose early and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.


5 Then the sons of Israel said, “Who among all the tribes of Israel did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah?” For they had taken a great oath concerning anyone who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.”  
6 And the sons of Israel were sorry for their brother Benjamin, and said, “Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel.  
7 What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters as wives?”


8 And they said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah?” And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.  
9 For when the people were counted, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there.  
10 So the congregation sent twelve thousand of the valiant men there and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and the little ones.  
11 This is the thing you shall do: you shall devote every male and every woman who has lain with a man to destruction.”  
12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.


13 Then the whole congregation sent and spoke to the sons of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.  
14 And Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jabesh-gilead; but even so, they were not enough for them.


15 And the people were sorry for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.  
16 Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?”  
17 And they said, “There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe may not be wiped out from Israel.  
18 But we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the sons of Israel have sworn, saying, ‘Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.’”  
19 And they said, “Behold, there is a feast of the LORD from year to year in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”


20 And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,  
21 and watch; and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each of you seize his wife from among the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.  
22 And it shall come about, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we shall say to them, ‘Grant them to us as a favor, because we did not take a wife for each of them in battle, nor did you yourselves give them to them, otherwise you would now be guilty.’”


23 So the sons of Benjamin did so, and took wives according to their number from the dancers whom they carried off; and they went and returned to their inheritance, and rebuilt the cities and lived in them.  
24 And the sons of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family; and each went out from there to his inheritance.


25 In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.﻿Ruth


Chapter 1


1 In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah went to live as a foreigner in the territory of Moab, he, his wife, and his two sons. 
2 The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They came to the territory of Moab and remained there.


3 Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.
4 They took Moabite wives for themselves; the name of one was Orpah, and the name of the other was Ruth. They lived there about ten years.
5 Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and the woman was left without her two children and without her husband.


6 She rose up with her daughters-in-law to return from the territory of Moab, because she had heard in the territory of Moab that the Lord had attended to His people by giving them food.
7 So she departed from the place where she had been, and her two daughters-in-law went with her, and they set out on the road back to the land of Judah.


8 Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each of you to your mother’s house. May the Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
9 May the Lord grant that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband." Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.


10 They said to her, "No, we will return with you to your people."


11 But Naomi said, "Turn back, my daughters. Why would you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may become your husbands?
12 Turn back, my daughters, go, for I am too old to have a husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me, even if I had a husband tonight and bore sons,
13 would you wait until they were grown? Would you refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me."


14 They lifted up their voices and wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.


15 Naomi said, "Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods. Return after your sister-in-law."


16 But Ruth said, "Do not urge me to leave you or to turn back from following you. For where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God.
17 Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord do so to me, and more also, if anything but death separates me from you."


18 When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her about it.
19 So the two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women said, "Is this Naomi?"


20 She said to them, "Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
21 I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi, when the Lord has testified against me, and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?"


22 Thus Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned from the territory of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.




Chapter 2


1 Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a man of standing from the clan of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.


2 Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, "Let me go into the field and glean among the ears of grain after someone in whose sight I may find favor." Naomi said to her, "Go, my daughter."
3 So she went out and came to a field and gleaned after the reapers. She happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the clan of Elimelech.


4 Now at that time, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, "May the Lord be with you!" And they answered him, "May the Lord bless you."
5 Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, "Whose young woman is this?"


6 The servant in charge of the reapers answered, "She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the territory of Moab.
7 She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers.’ So she came and has continued from morning until now, except for a short rest in the shelter."


8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field, nor leave this one, but stay close by my young women.
9 Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Have I not commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the young men have drawn."


10 Then she fell on her face, bowing down to the ground, and said to him, "Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take notice of me, though I am a foreigner?"


11 Boaz answered her, "All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband has been fully reported to me, and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people you did not know before.
12 May the Lord repay your work, and may your wages be full from the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge."


13 Then she said, "May I find favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not even like one of your servants."


14 At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come here, and eat some of the bread and dip your morsel in the vinegar." So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed roasted grain to her, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left over.


15 When she got up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, "Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.
16 Also pull out some grain for her from the bundles and leave it for her to glean, and do not rebuke her."


17 So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
18 She carried it back to the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also took out and gave her what she had left over after she was satisfied.


19 Her mother-in-law said to her, "Where did you glean today? And where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed!" So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, "The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz."


20 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May he be blessed by the Lord, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and to the dead." Naomi also said to her, "The man is a relative of ours, one of our redeemers."


21 Then Ruth the Moabitess said, "Furthermore, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’"


22 Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, so that you do not encounter harm in another field."


23 So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law.




Chapter 3


1 Then Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, "My daughter, should I not seek a place of rest for you, that it may be well with you?  
2 Now, is not Boaz, with whose young women you were, our relative? Now, see here, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.  
3 Therefore, wash and anoint yourself, put on your cloak, and go down to the threshing floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.  
4 And when he lies down, observe the place where he lies. Then go in, uncover his feet, and lie down; and he will tell you what you should do."  
5 And she said to her, "All that you say, I will do."


6 So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.  
7 When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.  
8 And it happened at midnight that the man trembled and turned over, and noticed a woman was lying at his feet.  
9 And he said, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth, your maidservant. Spread your wing over your maidservant, for you are a redeemer."  
10 And he said, "May you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter. You have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.  
11 And now, my daughter, do not be afraid. All that you say, I will do for you, for all the assembly of my people knows that you are a worthy woman.  
12 And now, it is true that I am a redeemer, yet there is a redeemer nearer than I.  
13 Remain tonight, and in the morning, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not desire to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the LORD lives. Lie down until the morning."


14 So she lay at his feet until the morning, but she arose before one could recognize another. And he said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor."  
15 And he said, "Bring the cloak that is on you and hold it out." So she held it out, and he measured out six measures of barley and laid it on her. Then she went into the city.  
16 And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "How did it go, my daughter?" And she told her all that the man had done for her,  
17 and she said, "These six measures of barley he gave me, for he said to me, ‘You must not go back empty to your mother-in-law.’"  
18 Then she said, "Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter will fall, for the man will not rest unless he has finished the matter today."




Chapter 4


1 Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there. And behold, the redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken was passing by. And Boaz said, “Turn aside, sit down here.” So he turned aside and sat down.
2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, “Sit down here.” And they sat down.


3 Then he said to the redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the fields of Moab, is selling the portion of the field that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
4 So I thought I would tell you, saying, ‘Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, tell me, that I may know. For there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I am after you.’” And he said, “I will redeem it.”
5 Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the dead man, in order to raise up the name of the dead man over his inheritance.”
6 Then the redeemer said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem it.”
7 Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redemption and exchange: to confirm every matter, a man would remove his sandal and give it to another; and this was the manner of confirmation in Israel.
8 So the redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” and he removed his sandal.


9 Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I have bought all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon from the hand of Naomi.
10 Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead man over his inheritance, so that the name of the dead man may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses today.”
11 And all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you achieve wealth in Ephrathah and make a name for yourself in Bethlehem.
12 And may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the offspring that the Lord will give you by this young woman.”


13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in to her, and the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son.
14 Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you today without a redeemer, and may his name be renowned in Israel!
15 He shall be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”
16 Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her lap, and she became his nurse.


17 And the women neighbors gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi.” And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.


18 Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron,
19 and Hezron fathered Ram, and Ram fathered Amminadab,
20 and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,
21 and Salmon fathered Boaz, and Boaz fathered Obed,
22 and Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.﻿First Samuel


Chapter 1


1 There was a certain man from Ramathaim Zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
2 He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.


3 Now this man used to go up from his town year by year to worship and to sacrifice to the Lord of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the Lord.
4 On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters.
5 But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, though the Lord had closed her womb.
6 Her rival used to provoke her bitterly to irritate her, because the Lord had closed her womb.
7 So it was, year after year; as often as she went up to the house of the Lord, she was provoked. Therefore she wept and would not eat.


8 Then Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”


9 After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the Lord.
10 She was deeply distressed and prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly.
11 She made a vow and said, “O Lord of hosts, if you will indeed look upon the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a male child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.”


12 As she continued praying before the Lord, Eli was watching her mouth.
13 Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she was drunk.
14 Eli said to her, “How long will you go on being drunk? Put away your wine from you!”


15 But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord, I am a woman of troubled spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord.
16 Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and distress.”


17 Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have made to him.”
18 She said, “Let your servant find favor in your sight.” Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer downcast.


19 They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the Lord. Then they returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the Lord remembered her.
20 And in due time, Hannah conceived and bore a son. She called his name Samuel, for she said, “I have asked him from the Lord.”


21 The man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow,
22 but Hannah did not go up. For she said to her husband, “Not until the boy is weaned; then I will bring him, so that he may appear before the Lord and dwell there forever.”
23 Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you; wait until you have weaned him. Only may the Lord confirm his word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son until she had weaned him.


24 When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh, though the child was young.
25 Then they slaughtered the bull, and brought the boy to Eli.
26 She said, “Oh, my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the Lord.
27 For this child I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my request that I made to him.
28 Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord. As long as he lives, he is lent to the Lord.” And he worshiped the Lord there.




Chapter 2


1 And Hannah prayed and said,  
“My heart exults in the LORD;  
my horn is lifted high in the LORD.  
My mouth boasts over my enemies,  
for I rejoice in Your salvation.
2 There is none holy like the LORD;  
indeed, there is no one besides You,  
nor is there any rock like our God.
3 Do not speak so very proudly;  
let arrogance not come from your mouth,  
for the LORD is a God of knowledge,  
and by Him deeds are weighed.
4 The bows of the mighty are broken,  
but those who stumbled gird themselves with strength.
5 Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread,  
but the hungry have ceased to hunger.  
Even the barren has borne seven,  
but she who had many children languishes.
6 The LORD kills and brings to life;  
He brings down to the grave and raises up.
7 The LORD makes poor and makes rich;  
He brings low and He lifts up.
8 He raises the poor from the dust;  
He lifts the needy from the ash heap,  
to seat them with nobles  
and inherit a seat of honor.  
For the pillars of the earth are the LORD's,  
and He has set the world upon them.
9 He guards the feet of His faithful ones,  
but the wicked are silenced in darkness;  
for not by strength shall a man prevail.
10 The adversaries of the LORD shall be shattered;  
against them He will thunder in the heavens.  
The LORD will judge the ends of the earth;  
He will give strength to His king  
and exalt the horn of His anointed.”


11 Then Elkanah went to Ramah to his house, but the boy ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.


12 Now the sons of Eli were worthless men; they did not know the LORD.
13 And the custom of the priests with the people was this: When any man offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand.
14 Then he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot; whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. Thus they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.


15 Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give meat to the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”  


16 And if the man said to him, “Let them surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,” he would say, “No, but you must give it now; and if not, I will take it by force.”
17 Thus the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD, for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt.


18 Now Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy clothed with a linen ephod.
19 And his mother would make for him a little robe and bring it to him each year when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.


20 Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, “May the LORD give you offspring from this woman in place of the one she dedicated to the LORD.” Then they would return to their home.
21 And the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in the presence of the LORD.  


22 Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
23 And he said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people.
24 No, my sons, it is not a good report that I hear the LORD’s people spreading abroad.
25 If a man sins against another, God will mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for it was the LORD’s will to put them to death.


26 Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and also with man.  


27 And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: Did I not plainly reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt, subject to Pharaoh’s house?
28 And did I not choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up to My altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? And did I not give to the house of your father all the offerings by fire from the people of Israel?
29 Why then do you scorn My sacrifices and My offerings that I commanded for My dwelling, and honor your sons above Me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of My people Israel?”


30 “Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: I said indeed that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever. But now,” declares the LORD, “far be it from Me! For those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me shall be treated with contempt.
31 Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father’s house,so that there will not be an old man in your house.
32 Then you will look with distress at all the prosperity that shall be bestowed upon Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.
33 Yet I will not cut off every man of yours from My altar, that My eyes may fail and My soul grieve, but all the descendants of your house shall die by the sword of men.  
34 And this that shall come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day.
35 And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in My heart and in My mind. And I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before My anointed forever.
36 And everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread and shall say, ‘Please give me one of the priest’s assignments, that I may eat a morsel of bread.’”




Chapter 3


1 Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; prophecies were not frequent.
2 And it happened at that time that Eli was lying down in his place—his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see—
3 and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.


4 Then the LORD called Samuel, and he said, “Here I am.”
5 And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call; go lie down again.” So he went and lay down.


6 And the LORD called again, “Samuel.” And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” And he said, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.”
7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.


8 And the LORD called Samuel again a third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy.
9 So Eli said to Samuel, “Go lie down, and if He calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.


10 Then the LORD came and stood, calling as at the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for Your servant is listening.”
11 Then the LORD said to Samuel, “Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.
12 On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.
13 And I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were bringing a curse upon themselves, and he did not restrain them.
14 Therefore I swore to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”


15 And Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. But Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.


16 Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.”
17 And he said, “What is the thing that He spoke to you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all that He spoke to you.”
18 So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, “It is the LORD. Let Him do what seems good to Him.”


19 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.
20 And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the LORD.
21 And the LORD continued to appear in Shiloh, for the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD.




Chapter 4


1 Now the word of Samuel came to all Israel. And Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle, and they camped beside Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped at Aphek.
2 The Philistines drew up in line to meet Israel, and when the battle spread out, Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who struck down about four thousand men in the field of battle.
3 When the army came back to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh, so that it may come among us and save us from the hand of our enemies.”


4 So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned above the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.


5 Now when the ark of the covenant of the LORD entered the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.
6 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, “What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” Then they learned that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.
7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.
8 Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every kind of plague in the wilderness.
9 Take courage and be men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews as they were to you; be men and fight.”


10 So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent. And the slaughter was very great, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.
11 And the ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
12 And a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh that same day with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.
13 And when he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and brought news, the whole city cried out.


14 When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, “What is the noise of this tumult?” Then the man hurried and told Eli.
15 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set, and he could not see.
16 And the man said to Eli, “I am the one who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle line today.” And he said, “How did things go, my son?”
17 And the messenger answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great slaughter among the people. And your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”
18 And when he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward from his seat by the side of the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and obese. And he had judged Israel for forty years.


19 Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, about to give birth. And when she heard the report that the ark of God was captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed down and gave birth, for her pains came upon her.
20 And at the time of her death, the women standing by her said, “Do not be afraid, for you have borne a son.” But she did not answer or pay attention.
21 And she named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel!” because the ark of God was captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
22 And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”  




Chapter 5


1 And the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
2 Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it beside Dagon.
3 When the men of Ashdod rose early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and set him back in his place.
4 But when they rose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD, and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.
5 Therefore the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.


6 And the hand of the LORD was heavy against the men of Ashdod, and He devastated them and struck them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory.
7 When the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is hard against us and against Dagon our god.”
8 So they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They said, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there.


9 But after they brought it around, the hand of the LORD was against the city with very great confusion, and He struck the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them.
10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people.”


11 So they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, so that it does not kill us and our people.” For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
12 And the men who did not die were struck with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.




Chapter 6


1 The ark of the LORD was in the territory of the Philistines for seven months.
2 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we should send it back to its place.”


3 They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return to Him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be made known to you why His hand has not turned away from you.”


4 And they said, “What is the guilt offering that we shall return to Him?”  
They said, “Five golden tumors and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for the same plague was on all of you and on your lords.
5 So you shall make images of your tumors and images of your mice that are ruining the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps He will lighten His hand from upon you, and your gods, and your land.
6 Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After He had dealt severely with them, did they not send them away, and they went?
7 So now, take and prepare one new cart and two milk cows on which there has never been a yoke. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves home away from them.
8 Then take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart. Put the golden objects that you are returning to Him as a guilt offering in a box beside it, and send it off, and let it go.
9 Watch: if it goes up by the way of its own land to Beth-shemesh, then He has done us this great harm. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that struck us; it happened to us by chance.”


10 And the men did so. They took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
11 And they placed the ark of the LORD on the cart, along with the box and the golden mice and the images of their tumors.
12 And the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-shemesh, along one highway, lowing as they went. They did not turn aside to the right or to the left. And the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.


13 Now the men of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and they rejoiced to see it.
14 The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there. There was a great stone. They split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
15 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was with it, in which were the golden objects, and they set them upon the great stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices on that day to the LORD.
16 And when the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned that same day to Ekron.


17 These are the golden tumors that the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron.
18 And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and unwalled villages. The great stone on which they set the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.


19 And He struck down some of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they looked upon the ark of the LORD. He struck down seventy men, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great blow.
20 And the men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall He go up away from us?”
21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to you.”




Chapter 7


1 And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the LORD. They brought it to the house of Abinadab on the hill and consecrated Eleazar, his son, to guard the ark of the LORD.
2 And from the day the ark stayed in Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed—twenty years—and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.


3 And Samuel said to all the house of Israel, “If with all your heart you are returning to the LORD, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you and direct your heart to the LORD and serve Him only, and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”
4 Then the sons of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth and served the LORD only.
5 And Samuel said, “Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you.”
6 So they gathered at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the LORD, and they fasted on that day and said there, “We have sinned against the LORD.” And Samuel judged the sons of Israel at Mizpah.


7 When the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the sons of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
8 And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.”


9 And Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. And Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.
10 As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the LORD thundered with a great voice on that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion, and they were routed before Israel.
11 And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and struck them down as far as below Beth-car.
12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen and called its name Ebenezer, and he said, “Thus far the LORD has helped us.”
13 So the Philistines were subdued and did not again come into the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
14 And the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.


15 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
16 And each year he went on a circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places.
17 Then he would return to Ramah, for his house was there, and there he also judged Israel. And he built there an altar to the LORD.




Chapter 8


1 When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.
2 The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second was Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba.
3 But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.


4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.
5 And they said to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations.”


6 But the thing was displeasing in Samuel’s eyes when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” And Samuel prayed to the LORD.
7 And the LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for it is not you they have rejected. Instead, it is Me that they have rejected from reigning over them.
8 Just as they have done to Me from the day I brought them up out of Egypt to this day—forsaking Me and serving other gods—so they are doing also to you.
9 Now then, listen to their voice. But you must solemnly warn them and declare to them the practice of the king who will reign over them.”


10 So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king.
11 And he said, “This will be the practice of the king who will reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for himself in his chariots and among his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots.
12 He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment for his chariots.
13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.
14 He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his servants.
15 He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.
16 He will take your male servants and your female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them to do his work.
17 He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his servants.
18 And in that day you will cry out because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD will not answer you on that day.”


19 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel. And they said, “No! But there shall be a king over us,
20 so that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.”


21 When Samuel heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the LORD.
22 And the LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice and appoint a king for them.” Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Each of you go to his city.”




Chapter 9


1 Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man of standing.
2 And he had a son whose name was Saul, a choice and handsome man, and there was no one among the sons of Israel more handsome than he. From his shoulders and upward he was taller than any of the people.


3 Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. So Kish said to Saul his son, “Take one of the young men with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys.”
4 And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. And he passed through the land of Benjamin, but they did not find them.
5 When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, lest my father stop thinking about the donkeys and become anxious about us.”


6 But he said to him, “Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and the man is held in honor; all that he says surely comes to pass. Let us go there now; perhaps he can tell us the way our journey should take.”


7 Then Saul said to his servant, “But if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread in our packs is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?”


8 And the servant answered Saul again and said, “See here, I have in hand a quarter-shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God, and he will tell us our way.”


9 (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say thus: “Come, let us go to the seer,” for the prophet of today was formerly called a seer.)


10 Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.
11 As they were going up the ascent to the city, they met young women coming out to draw water and said to them, “Is the seer here?”


12 And they answered them and said, “He is; behold, he is ahead of you. Hurry now, for today he has come to the city, because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.
13 As soon as you enter the city, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifice. Afterward those who are invited will eat. Now go up, for you will find him at once.”
14 So they went up to the city. As they were coming into the city, behold, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the high place.


15 Now the LORD had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,
16 “At about this time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him prince over My people Israel. He shall save My people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have seen My people, because their cry has come to Me.”


17 When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, “Look! The man of whom I spoke to you! This one shall rule over My people.”


18 Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.”


19 And Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for today you shall eat with me. And in the morning I will send you away and will tell you all that is in your heart.
20 And as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father’s house?”


21 And Saul answered and said, “Am I not a Benjamite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?”


22 Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited—about thirty men.
23 And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion that I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Set it aside.’”
24 So the cook took up the thigh and what was on it and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, “Behold, what has been reserved is set before you. Eat, because it has been kept for you until the appointed time, when I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
25 And when they came down from the high place into the city, he spoke with Saul on the roof.


26 And they rose early. Then at the break of dawn, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, “Rise, that I may send you off.” So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.
27 As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us”—and he passed on—“but you, stand still now, that I may let you hear the word of God.”




Chapter 10


1 Then Samuel took the flask of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, “Has not the LORD anointed you to be ruler over His inheritance?
2 When you depart from me today, you will find two men near Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you, ‘The donkeys which you went to seek have been found, and behold, your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and is anxious for you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?”’


3 Then you shall go on from there further and come to the oak of Tabor, and three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.
4 And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hand.
5 After that you shall come to Gibeath-haelohim, where the Philistine garrison is; and it shall be, when you come to the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, and they will be prophesying.
6 Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be changed into another man.
7 And when these signs come to you, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.
8 Then you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do.


9 Then it happened that when he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day.
10 When they came there to Gibeah, behold, a group of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them.


11 Now all who had known him previously saw that he prophesied with the prophets, and the people said to one another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”
12 Then a man from there answered and said, “And who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
13 And when he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.


14 Now Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To seek the donkeys. And when we saw that they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”
15 Then Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”
16 And Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom which Samuel had mentioned.


17 Then Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah.
18 And he said to the sons of Israel, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’
19 But today you have rejected your God, who Himself saves you from all your calamities and your distresses, and you have said to Him, ‘No, but set a king over us!’ Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your thousands.”


20 So Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.
21 Then he brought near the tribe of Benjamin by its clans, and the clan of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken. But when they sought him, he could not be found.
22 So they inquired again of the LORD, “Has the man come here yet?” And the LORD said, “Behold, he is hiding himself among the baggage.”


23 So they ran and took him from there. And when he stood among the people, he was taller than all the people from his shoulders upward.
24 And Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the one whom the LORD has chosen? Surely there is none like him among all the people.” And all the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!”


25 Then Samuel told the people the ordinance of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, each to his house.
26 Saul also went to his house at Gibeah; and the valiant men whose hearts God had touched went with him.
27 But some worthless men said, “How can this man save us?” And they despised him and brought him no gift. But he kept silent.




Chapter 11


1 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against Jabesh-gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.”
2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition I will make a treaty with you—by gouging out every man's right eye, thus bringing disgrace on all Israel.”
3 And the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to deliver us, we will come out to you.”


4 So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke these words in the ears of the people. And all the people lifted up their voices and wept.
5 Now at this time, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen, and Saul said, “What is wrong with the people, that they are weeping?” So they recounted to him the words of the men of Jabesh.
6 And the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger burned greatly.
7 So he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.” Then the dread of the LORD fell upon the people, and they came out as one man.
8 And he mustered them at Bezek, and the sons of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.


9 Then they said to the messengers who had come, “Thus shall you say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.’” So the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced.
10 Then the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good in your eyes.”
11 And it came to pass the next day that Saul put the people in three companies, and they came into the midst of the camp during the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. And those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.


12 Then the people said to Samuel, “Who is it that said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring the men, that we may put them to death.”
13 But Saul said, “No man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has worked deliverance in Israel.”


14 Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal, and there renew the kingdom.”


15 And all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. And there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.




Chapter 12


1 Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me and have made a king reign over you.
2 Now, behold, the king walks before you, and I am old and gray, and my sons are with you. I have walked before you from my youth until this day.
3 Here I am; testify against me before the LORD and before His anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I oppressed? Whom have I defrauded? From whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me, and I will restore it to you.”


4 And they said, “You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man's hand.”


5 And he said to them, “The LORD is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that you have found nothing in my hand.” And they said, “He is witness.”


6 Then Samuel said to the people, “The LORD is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt.
7 Now therefore stand still, that I may judge you before the LORD concerning all the righteous acts of the LORD which He did for you and for your fathers.
8 When Jacob came into Egypt and your fathers cried out to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
9 But they forgot the LORD their God, and He sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
10 Then they cried out to the LORD and said, ‘We have sinned, for we have forsaken the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. But now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve You.’
11 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you lived in safety.
12 But when you saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us’—though the LORD your God was your king.


13 Now behold the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked—behold, the LORD has set a king over you.
14 If you will fear the LORD and serve Him and listen to His voice and not rebel against the command of the LORD, then both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God.
15 But if you will not listen to the voice of the LORD but rebel against the command of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you and your fathers.
16 Now also, stand still and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes.
17 Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the LORD, that He may send thunder and rain, and you will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking for yourselves a king.”


18 So Samuel called upon the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day, and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
19 And all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for ourselves a king.”


20 And Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear. You have done all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.
21 And do not turn aside after empty things that cannot profit or deliver, for they are nothing.
22 For the LORD will not forsake His people for His great name’s sake, because it has pleased the LORD to make you a people for Himself.
23 Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you, but I will instruct you in the good and right way.
24 Only fear the LORD and serve Him in truth with all your heart, for consider what great things He has done for you.
25 But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king.”




Chapter 13


1 Saul was [thirty] years old when he began to reign, and he reigned over Israel for two years.
2 Saul chose for himself three thousand men from Israel: two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent away, each to his tent.


3 Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”
4 And all Israel heard it said that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines. So the people were summoned to Saul at Gilgal.
5 And the Philistines gathered to fight with Israel: thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven.


6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in distress—for the people were hard-pressed—the people hid themselves in caves and thickets, in rocks, in cellars, and in pits.
7 And some Hebrews crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
8 And he waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.


9 So Saul said, “Bring the burnt offering and the peace offerings here to me.” And he offered the burnt offering.


10 Just as he finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came. And Saul went out to meet him and to bless him.


11 But Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash,
12 I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.’ So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering.”


13 Then Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly. You have not kept the command of the LORD your God, which He commanded you. For then the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
14 But now your kingdom shall not endure. The LORD has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and the LORD has appointed him to be ruler over His people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you.”


15 Then Samuel rose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul counted the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.
16 And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were present with them stayed in Geba of Benjamin, while the Philistines encamped at Michmash.


17 And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual,
18 and another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another company turned toward the border that overlooks the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.


19 Now there was no blacksmith to be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears.”
20 So all Israel had to go down to the Philistines to sharpen each man his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his sickle,
21 and the price was a pim for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to set the goads.


22 So it came to pass on the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan. But Saul and Jonathan his son had them.
23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.




Chapter 14


1 Now it came to pass one day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us cross over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.
2 And Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron; and the people who were with him were about six hundred men,
3 and Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, priest of the LORD at Shiloh, was wearing the ephod. But the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.


4 Now between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on one side and a rocky crag on the other side; the name of one was Bozez, and the name of the other was Seneh.
5 One crag rose on the north opposite Michmash, and the other on the south opposite Geba.
6 And Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; perhaps the LORD will act for us, for nothing restrains the LORD from saving by many or by few.”
7 And his armor-bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart; turn yourself, here I am with you according to your heart.”
8 Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will cross over to the men and reveal ourselves to them.
9 If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand in our place and not go up to them.
10 But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hand, and this shall be the sign for us.”


11 So both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Behold, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.”
12 And the men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said, “Come up to us and we will show you something.” Then Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel.”
13 And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer was putting them to death after him.
14 And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made was about twenty men, within about half a furrow in an acre of field.
15 And there was trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison and the raiders also trembled, and the earth quaked, and it became a trembling from God.


16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude was melting away and going here and there.
17 Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Call the roll now and see who has gone from us.” And when they had called the roll, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.
18 And Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God was at that time with the sons of Israel.
19 And it came to pass, while Saul spoke to the priest, that the tumult in the camp of the Philistines kept increasing more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”
20 Then Saul and all the people who were with him assembled and went into the battle, and behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion.
21 Moreover, the Hebrews who were with the Philistines previously, who had gone up with them into the camp all around, they also changed sides to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
22 Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also pursued them in battle.
23 So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle passed beyond Beth-aven.


24 And the men of Israel were hard-pressed that day, and Saul had put the people under oath, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food before evening, and until I have avenged myself on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.
25 And all the land entered the forest, and there was honey on the surface of the ground.
26 And when the people came into the forest, behold, the honey was dripping, but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
27 But Jonathan had not heard when his father put the people under oath. So he put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and he put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.
28 Then one of the people answered and said, “Your father strictly put the people under oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food this day.’” And the people were faint.


29 Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. See now how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.
30 How much more if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great.”


31 And they struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were very faint.
32 And the people rushed greedily upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.


33 Then they told Saul, saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood.” And he said, “You have acted treacherously; roll a large stone to me today.”
34 And Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, ‘Each man bring me his ox or his sheep and slaughter it here and eat, and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.’” So every man brought his ox with him that night and slaughtered it there.
35 And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar he built to the LORD.
36 Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man among them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”
37 And Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You give them into the hand of Israel?” But He did not answer him that day.


38 So Saul said, “Come here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see in what this sin has happened today.
39 For as the LORD lives, who saves Israel, even if it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But not one of all the people answered him.
40 Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what is good in your eyes.”
41 And Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, “Give a perfect lot.” And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, but the people escaped.
42 And Saul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.” And Jonathan was taken.


43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him and said, “I certainly tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I must die.”


44 And Saul said, “May God do so and more also, for you shall surely die, Jonathan.”


45 But the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has brought about this great salvation in Israel? Far be it! As the LORD lives, not a hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.
46 Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their place.
47 And Saul took the kingship over Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side: against Moab, and against the sons of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; and wherever he turned, he prevailed.
48 And he acted valiantly and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hand of those who plundered them.


49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchi-shua, and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.
50 And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.
51 And Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.


52 And the war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul. And whenever Saul saw any mighty man or any valiant man, he took him to himself.




Chapter 15


1 And Samuel said to Saul, “The LORD sent me to anoint you as king over His people, over Israel; now therefore listen to the voice of the words of the LORD.
2 Thus says the LORD of hosts: ‘I have attended to what Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way as he came up from Egypt.
3 Now go and strike Amalek and put under the ban all that he has. Do not spare him, but put to death man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”


4 So Saul summoned the troops and mustered them at Telaim: two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah.
5 And Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley.
6 And Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, withdraw, come down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up from Egypt.” So the Kenites withdrew from among Amalek.


7 And Saul struck the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.
8 And he captured Agag the king of Amalek alive, but all the people he put under the ban with the edge of the sword.
9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and the oxen and the fattened ones and the lambs, and all that was good, and were unwilling to put them under the ban. But all that was despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.


10 Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying,
11 “I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not carried out My words.” And Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the LORD all night.
12 And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told to Samuel, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal.”


13 And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, “Blessed are you of the LORD. I have carried out the word of the LORD.”


14 But Samuel said, “What then is this sound of sheep in my ears, and the sound of oxen that I hear?”


15 And Saul said, “They brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God; but the rest we have put under the ban.”


16 Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop, and I will declare to you what the LORD said to me last night.” And he said to him, “Speak.”


17 And Samuel said, “Though you are small in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD anointed you king over Israel.
18 And the LORD sent you on a mission and said, ‘Go, and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’
19 Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but rushed upon the spoil and did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD?”


20 And Saul said to Samuel, “I did obey the voice of the LORD and went on the mission on which the LORD sent me, and I brought Agag the king of Amalek, and I put Amalek under the ban.
21 But the people took from the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of what was under the ban, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.”


22 Then Samuel said,
“Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices
as in obeying the voice of the LORD?
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,
and to listen than the fat of rams.
23 For rebellion is as the sin of divination,
and arrogance is as iniquity and idolatry.
Because you have rejected the word of the LORD,
He has rejected you from being king.”


24 And Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned, for I transgressed the command of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and listened to their voice.
25 Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me, that I may bow down to the LORD.”


26 But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.”
27 And Samuel turned to go, but he grabbed the edge of his robe, and it tore.
28 And Samuel said to him, “The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to your neighbor, who is better than you.
29 And also the Glory of Israel does not lie or relent, for He is not a man, that He should relent.”


30 Then he said, “I have sinned; yet please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may bow down to the LORD your God.”
31 So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul bowed down to the LORD.


32 Then Samuel said, “Bring here to me Agag the king of Amalek.” And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”


33 But Samuel said,
“As your sword has made women childless,
so shall your mother be childless among women.”
And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.


34 Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul.
35 And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death,
though Samuel grieved over Saul.
And the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.




Chapter 16


1 And the LORD said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for Myself a king from among his sons.”


2 But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.” And the LORD said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’
3 Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will make known to you what you shall do. You shall anoint for Me the one whom I designate to you.”


4 So Samuel did what the LORD had said and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, “Do you come in peace?”
5 He said, “In peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
6 And when they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, “Surely the LORD’s anointed is before Him.”
7 But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, for I have rejected him. For the LORD does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”


8 Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.”
9 Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.”
10 Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD has not chosen these.”
11 And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are these all the boys?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but he is tending the sheep.” Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.”


12 So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a good appearance. And the LORD said, “Arise, anoint him, for this is he.”
13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose and went to Ramah.


14 Now the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and a harmful spirit from the LORD tormented him.
15 And Saul’s servants said to him, “Behold now, a harmful spirit from God is tormenting you.
16 Let our lord command your servants who are before you to seek a man who is skillful in playing the lyre. And it shall be, when the harmful spirit from God is upon you, that he shall play with his hand, and you will be well.”


17 So Saul said to his servants, “Provide for me now a man who plays well and bring him to me.”


18 Then one of the young men answered and said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a warrior, prudent in speech, and a man of good form, and the LORD is with him.”
19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.”
20 And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by his son David to Saul.
21 And David came to Saul and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.
22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight.”
23 And whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take the lyre and play with his hand. Then Saul would be refreshed and well, and the harmful spirit would depart from him.




Chapter 17


1 Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle, and they were assembled at Socoh, which belongs to Judah. They camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
2 And Saul and the men of Israel assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah, and they drew up in battle array to meet the Philistines.
3 The Philistines stood on the mountain on one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.
4 Then a champion came out from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
5 He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he wore scale armor, and the weight of the bronze armor was five thousand shekels.
6 He had bronze greaves on his legs, and a bronze javelin was slung between his shoulders.
7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the iron point of his spear weighed six hundred shekels. His shield-bearer went before him.
8 He stood and called out to the ranks of Israel and said to them, “Why do you come out to form battle lines? Am I not the Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.
9 If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our servants and serve us.”
10 And the Philistine said, “I defy the battle lines of Israel this day. Give me a man, that we may fight together.”
11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.


12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul, the man was old and advanced in years.
13 The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle. The names of his three sons who went to the battle were: Eliab the firstborn, and the second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
14 Now David was the youngest. The three oldest had followed Saul,
15 but David would go back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s flock at Bethlehem.
16 The Philistine came forward morning and evening, and took his stand for forty days.


17 Then Jesse said to David his son, “Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.
18 Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See if your brothers are well, and bring back some token from them.”


19 Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
20 So David rose early in the morning, left the flock with a keeper, and took the provisions and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the encampment as the army was going out to the battle line shouting the war cry.
21 Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle array, army against army.
22 And David left the provisions in the care of the keeper of supplies and ran to the battle line. He went and greeted his brothers.
23 As he was speaking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath named Goliath, came up from the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before, and David heard them.
24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were greatly afraid.


25 And the men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who is coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel. And it shall be that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house exempt in Israel.”
26 Then David spoke to the men standing with him and said, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the disgrace from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”
27 And the people answered him in the same way, “Thus shall it be done to the man who kills him.”


28 Now Eliab his oldest brother heard him speaking to the men, and Eliab’s anger burned against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the evil of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.”
29 And David said, “What have I done now? Was it not just a word?”
30 Then he turned away from him to another and said the same thing, and those men answered him as before.
31 When the words which David spoke were heard, they were reported to Saul, and he sent for him.
32 And David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”


33 But Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth.”
34 But David said to Saul, “Your servant was tending his father's sheep, and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,
35 I went out after it and struck it and delivered it from its mouth. And when it rose against me, I caught it by its beard and struck it and killed it.
36 Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.”
37 And David said, “The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and may the LORD be with you.”


38 Then Saul clothed David with his own garments, and put a bronze helmet on his head and clothed him with armor.
39 And David strapped his sword over his armor and tried to walk, for he had not trained in them. Then David said to Saul, “I cannot go with these, for I have not trained them.” So David took them off.
40 Then he took his staff in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the shepherd's pouch which he had, even in his bag, and his sling was in his hand. Then he drew near to the Philistine.


41 Then the Philistine came on and approached David, with the man bearing the shield in front of him.
42 And when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was only a youth, ruddy and of good appearance.
43 And the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
44 Then the Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.”


45 Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
46 This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and remove your head from you. And I will give the corpses of the camp of the Philistines this day to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
47 and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not save with sword or spear; for the battle is the LORD’s, and He will give you into our hand.”


48 Then it came about that when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.
49 And David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.
50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; he struck the Philistine and killed him. But there was no sword in David’s hand.
51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it from its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
52 Then the men of Israel and Judah rose up and shouted and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the slain Philistines fell along the way to Shaaraim and as far as Gath and Ekron.
53 Then the sons of Israel returned from hot pursuit of the Philistines and plundered their camp.
54 And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his own tent.


55 Now when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Whose son is this young man, Abner?” And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.”
56 And the king said, “Inquire whose son the youth is.”
57 So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
58 Then Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David said, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”




Chapter 18


1 And it came to pass, when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
2 Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's house.
3 Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul.
4 And Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, as well as his armor, his sword, his bow, and his belt.


5 And David went out wherever Saul sent him, and he prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the eyes of all the servants and also in the eyes of the people.
6 And it came to pass, as they were coming, when David returned from striking down the Philistine, that the women came out from all the towns of Israel to sing and dance to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with musical instruments.
7 And the women sang as they played, and said,  
“Saul has struck down his thousands,  
and David his ten thousands.”
8 Then Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him. And he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed thousands. What more can he have but the kingdom?”
9 So Saul observed David from that day forward.


10 And it came to pass the next day that a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house, and David was playing the lyre with his hand as he did day by day; and Saul had a spear in his hand.
11 And Saul threw the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David evaded him twice.
12 And Saul was afraid of David, for the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul.
13 So Saul removed him from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
14 And David prospered in all his ways, and the LORD was with him.
15 And when Saul saw that he prospered greatly, he stood in dread of him.
16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.


17 Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife. Only be a man of valor for me and fight the LORD's battles.” For Saul thought, “Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.”
18 And David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?”
19 But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.


20 Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David; and when they told Saul, the thing pleased him.
21 And Saul said, “I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David a second time, “You shall now be my son-in-law.”


22 And Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David secretly, saying, ‘Behold, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you. Now become the king’s son-in-law.’”
23 And Saul's servants spoke those words in David's ears. But David said, “Is it a light thing in your eyes to become the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?”
24 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, “David has spoken in this way.”
25 Then Saul said, “Thus shall you say to David, ‘The king desires no bride-price except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged on the king's enemies.’” Now Saul intended to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
26 When his servants told David these words, it pleased David to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the appointed days expired,
27 David arose and went, he and his men, and struck down two hundred men of the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they counted them out before the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife.


28 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.
29 Then Saul grew even more afraid of David. So Saul was David’s enemy continually.
30 Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out, David was more successful than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed.




Chapter 19


1 Saul spoke to Jonathan, his son and to all his servants, that they should put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted greatly in David.
2 So Jonathan told David, saying, “Saul, my father, seeks to kill you. Now therefore, be on your guard in the morning, stay in a secret place and hide yourself.
3 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak about you to my father. Then if I learn anything, I will tell you.”


4 So Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul, his father, and said to him, “The king should not sin against his servant David, for he has not sinned against you, and his deeds have been very beneficial to you.
5 For he took his life in his hand and struck down the Philistines, and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?”


6 And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, “As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death.”
7 Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.


8 And there was war again, and David went out and fought with the Philistines and struck them with a great slaughter, and they fled before him.
9 Then a harmful spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand, while David was playing the lyre.
10 And Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul’s presence, so that he struck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.


11 Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him, that he might kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”
12 So Michal let David down through the window, and he went and fled and escaped.
13 And Michal took the household idol and laid it on the bed, and put a quilt of goats’ hair at its head and covered it with the garment.
14 And when Saul sent messengers to seize David, she said, “He is sick.”
15 Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him to me in the bed, so I may kill him.”


16 And when the messengers came in, they saw the household idol in the bed with the quilt of goats’ hair at its head.
17 And Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he escaped?” And Michal said to Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’”


18 Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed at Naioth.
19 Then it was told to Saul, saying, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.”
20 So Saul sent messengers to take David, but when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
21 And when it was told to Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. So Saul sent messengers again a third time, and they also prophesied.
22 Then he himself went to Ramah and came to the great well that is in Secu. And he asked and said, “Where are Samuel and David?” And someone said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.”
23 So he went there to Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God came upon him also, and as he went, he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
24 And he too stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel, and lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”




Chapter 20


1 Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and he came and said before Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my guilt, and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?”  
2 And he said to him, “Far from it! You shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing, either great or small, without revealing it to me. Why should my father hide this from me? It is not so.”  
3 But David swore again and said, “Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he thinks, ‘Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.’ But truly, as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.”  


4 Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”  
5 And David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I ought to sit with the king at the meal. But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field until the evening of the third day.  
6 If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem his city, for the yearly sacrifice is there for all the clan.’
7 If he says, ‘Good!’ it will be well with your servant; but if he is angry, then know that harm is determined by him.
8 Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?”
9 And Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I knew that harm was determined by my father to come upon you, would I not tell you?”
10 Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”  


11 And Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out into the field.” So both of them went out into the field.  
12 And Jonathan said to David, “By the LORD, the God of Israel, when I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow or the third day, behold, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose it to you?  
13 But if it please my father to do you harm, may the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also, if I do not disclose it to you and send you away, that you may go in peace. May the LORD be with you as He has been with my father.  
14 If I am still alive, show me the steadfast love of the LORD, that I may not die;  
15 and do not cut off your steadfast love from my house forever, not even when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.”  


16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the LORD take vengeance on David’s enemies.”  
17 And Jonathan again made David swear, because he loved him, for he loved him as his own soul.  


18 Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.  
19 On the third day go down quickly to the place where you hid yourself on the day of my father’s actions, and remain beside the stone Ezel.  
20 And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a target.  
21 And then, I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them,’ then come, for there is peace for you and it is safe, as the LORD lives.  
22 But if I say to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then escape, for the LORD has sent you away.  
23 As for the matter of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever.”  


24 So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat the meal.  
25 The king sat on his seat, as at other times, on the seat by the wall. Jonathan sat opposite, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty.  
26 Yet Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, “Something has happened to him. He is not clean; surely he is not clean.”  
27 But on the second day, the day after the new moon, David’s place was still empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”  


28 And Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.  
29 He said, ‘Let me go, please, for our clan holds a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me go away to see my brothers.’ For this reason he has not come to the king’s table.”  


30 Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?  
31 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Therefore send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.”  
32 Then Jonathan answered Saul his father, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”  
33 But Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to kill David.  
34 And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food on the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved for David because his father had disgraced him.  


35 In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David, and a small boy was with him.
36 And he said to his boy, “Run, find the arrows that I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
37 And when the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, “Is not the arrow beyond you?”
38 And Jonathan called after the boy, “Quick! Hurry! Do not stay!” So Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows and came to his master.
39 But the boy knew nothing; only Jonathan and David knew about the signal.
40 And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.”


41 As soon as the boy had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap and fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. Then they kissed one another and wept with one another, David weeping the more.
42 And Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, because we have sworn, both of us, in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD shall be between me and you, and between my descendents and your descendents, forever.’” Then he rose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.




Chapter 21


1 Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech trembled as he met David, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no man with you?”  
2 And David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commissioned me with a matter and said to me, ‘Let no man know anything of the matter about which I am sending you and with which I have charged you.’ And I have directed the young men to such and such a place.  
3 Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.”  


4 And the priest answered David and said, “There is no ordinary bread on hand, but there is holy bread—if the young men have kept themselves from women.”  
5 And David answered the priest and said to him, “Indeed, women have been kept from us as always when I go out on campaign, and the vessels of the young men are holy, though it was but a common journey. How much more then today will their vessels be holy?”  


6 So the priest gave him the holy bread, for there was no bread there but the Bread of the Presence, which had been taken from before the LORD, to be replaced with hot bread on the day it was taken away.  
7 Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; his name was Doeg the Edomite, chief of Saul’s herdsmen.  


8 And David said to Ahimelech, “Is there not here on hand a spear or a sword? For I did not bring my sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s matter was urgent.”  
9 And the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of Elah, see, it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take it, take it—for there is none but that here.” And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”  


10 Then David rose and fled that day from Saul, and came to Achish king of Gath.  
11 But the servants of Achish said to him, “Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing of him to one another in dances, saying,  
‘Saul has struck down his thousands,  
and David his tens of thousands’?”  


12 And David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath.  
13 So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be mad in their hands. He scratched marks on the doors of the gate and let his spittle run down his beard.  
14 Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?  
15 Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence? Shall this man come into my house?”




Chapter 22


1 David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him.
2 And every man who was in distress, and every man who had a creditor, and every man who was embittered, gathered to him, and he became commander over them. About four hundred men were there with him.


3 David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me.”
4 And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.
5 But Gad the prophet said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Depart and go into the land of Judah.” So David went and came to the forest of Hereth.


6 Now Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered. Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.
7 Saul said to his servants who stood around him, “Hear now, Benjaminites! Will the son of Jesse also give every one of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds,
8 that all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse! None of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in ambush, as on this day!”


9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech son of Ahitub.
10 And he inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”


11 Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob, and they all came to the king.
12 And Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.” And he said, “Here I am, my lord.”
13 Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you gave him bread and a sword and inquired of God for him, so that he rose up against me to lie in ambush, as on this day?”


14 Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, “Who among all your servants is as faithful as David, the king’s son-in-law and captain of your guard and honored in your house?
15 Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? Far be it from me! Let not the king lay anything to the charge of his servant or of any of the house of my father, for your servant knows nothing of this, little or much.”
16 But the king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house.”


17 And the king said to the guards who stood around him, “Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to strike the priests of the LORD.
18 Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn and strike the priests.” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.
19 And he struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword—man and woman, child and infant, ox and donkey and sheep—all of them with the edge of the sword.


20 But one of the sons of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, whose name was Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.
21 And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
22 And David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of all the people in your father’s house.
23 Stay with me; do not be afraid. For he who seeks my life seeks your life. You will be safe with me.”




Chapter 23


1 And they told David, saying, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are plundering the threshing floors.”
2 So David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go and strike these Philistines?” And the LORD said to David, “Go and strike the Philistines and save Keilah.”
3 But David’s men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”
4 Then David inquired again of the LORD, and the LORD answered him and said, “Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand.”
5 So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines and drove off their livestock and struck them with a great blow. Thus David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.


6 Now when Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he had come down with an ephod in his hand.
7 And it was told to Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a city with gates and bars.”
8 Then Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
9 But David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him, and he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”
10 Then David said, “O LORD, the God of Israel, Your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city on my account.
11 Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O LORD, the God of Israel, please tell Your servant.” And the LORD said, “He will come down.”
12 Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And the LORD said, “They will surrender you.”
13 Then David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. And when it was told to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition.


14 And David remained in the wilderness strongholds and stayed in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.
15 And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.
16 And Jonathan, Saul’s son, rose and went to David at Horesh and strengthened his hand in God.
17 And he said to him, “Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. Saul, my father, also knows this.”
18 And the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went to his house.


19 Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon?
20 Now then, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down, and our part will be to deliver him into the king’s hand.”
21 And Saul said, “May you be blessed by the LORD, for you have had compassion on me.
22 Go now, make sure. Know and see the place where his foot is and who has seen him there, for I have been told that he is very crafty.
23 Therefore, observe and take note of all the hiding places where he hides, and come back to me with details. Then I will go with you. And if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.”


24 And they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon.
25 And Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told, so he went down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon.
26 Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, while Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them.
27 But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have raided the land.”
28 So Saul returned from pursuing David and went to meet the Philistines. Therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape.
29 And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En-gedi.




Chapter 24


1 And it came to pass, when Saul returned from following the Philistines, that he was told, “Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.”
2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.
3 And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave, and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave.


4 And the men of David said to him, “Look! The day of which the LORD said to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good in your eyes.’” Then David arose and stealthily cut off the edge of Saul’s robe.
5 And afterward David’s heart struck him because he had cut off the edge of Saul’s robe.
6 And he said to his men, “Far be it from me, by the LORD, that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, for he is the LORD’s anointed.”
7 So David restrained his men with these words and did not allow them to attack Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went on his way.


8 After this, David also arose and went out of the cave and called after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.
9 And David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of a man, saying, ‘See! David seeks your harm’?
10 Instead, this day your eyes have seen how the LORD gave you today into my hand in the cave. And some told me to kill you, but I spared you and said, ‘I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD’s anointed.’
11 And, my father, look—yes, look: the edge of your robe in my hand! Because I cut off the edge of your robe and did not kill you, know and see that there is no evil or transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you lie in wait for my life to take it.
12 May the LORD judge between me and you, and may the LORD avenge me on you, but my hand shall not be against you.
13 As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness,’ but my hand shall not be against you.


14 After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom are you pursuing? After a dead dog? After a single flea?
15 May the LORD therefore be judge and give sentence between me and you, and see and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand.”


16 And so, when David finished speaking these words to Saul, he said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
17 And he said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you with evil.
18 And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me, that when the LORD delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me.
19 For what man, finding his enemy, lets him go away safely? So may the LORD reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.


20 And now, behold, I know that you shall surely reign, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
21 Now swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not destroy my name from my father's house.”
22 So David swore to Saul. And Saul went to his house, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.




Chapter 25


1 Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him, and they buried him at his house in Ramah. Then David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.


2 Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. The man was very wealthy, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. And he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
3 Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife was Abigail. The woman was discerning and beautiful, but the man was harsh and evil in his dealings. He was a Calebite.


4 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
5 So David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal and greet him in my name.
6 And thus you shall say to him, ‘Peace to you, and peace to your house, and peace to all that you have.
7 Now I hear that you have shearers. Now your shepherds have been with us, and we did them no harm, and nothing was missing from them all the time they were in Carmel.
8 Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes, for we come on a feast day. Please give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.’”
9 And when David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David. Then they waited.


10 But Nabal answered David’s servants and said, “Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants these days who are breaking away from their masters.
11 Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men from who-knows-where?”
12 So David’s young men turned away and came back, and they told him all these words.
13 And David said to his men, “Each of you gird on his sword.” So each man girded on his sword, and David also girded on his sword. And about four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.


14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master, and he cursed them.
15 Yet the men were very good to us, and we were not harmed, and we did not miss anything while we were in the fields as long as we were among them.
16 They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the time we were with them keeping the sheep.
17 Now therefore know this and consider what you should do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his household, and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him.”


18 Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five prepared sheep, five seahs of parched grain, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and she loaded them on donkeys.
19 And she said to her young men, “Go on before me; for I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
20 And as she was riding on the donkey and came down under cover of the mountain, it happened that David and his men were coming down toward her, and she met them.


21 Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has returned me evil for good.
22 God do so to the enemies of David and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him.”


23 And when Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground.
24 She fell at his feet and said, “On me alone, my lord, be the guilt. Please let your servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your servant.
25 Let not my lord regard this worthless man, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I, your servant, did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.


26 Now then, my lord, as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, since the LORD has restrained you from the guilt of bloodshed and from taking revenge with your own hand, now let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal.
27 And now let this gift that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord.
28 Please forgive the trespass of your servant, for the LORD will certainly make a lasting house for my lord, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil shall not be found in you all your days.
29 If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound among the living with the LORD your God. And the lives of your enemies He shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling.


30 And when the LORD has done to my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you prince over Israel,
31 then this will not be a stumbling block to you or a cause of guilt to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause or that my lord has avenged himself. And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.”


32 And David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me.
33 Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from shedding blood and from taking revenge by my own hand.
34 For as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has restrained me from doing you harm, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely by morning there would not have been left to Nabal so much as one male.”
35 Then David received from her hand what she had brought him. And he said to her, “Go up in peace to your house. See, I have listened to your voice and have granted your request.”


36 And Abigail came to Nabal, and at that time he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until the morning light.
37 And in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him what happened, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
38 And about ten days later the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.


39 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal and has kept back His servant from evil. The LORD has returned the evil of Nabal on his own head.” Then David sent a message to Abigail, to take her as his wife.
40 And when the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, “David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.”
41 And she rose and bowed with her face to the ground and said, “Behold, your servant is a handmaid to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”
42 And Abigail hurried and rose and rode on a donkey, with five of her maidens who attended her. And she followed the messengers of David and became his wife.


43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and both of them became his wives.
44 Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.




Chapter 26


1 Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon?”
2 So Saul rose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, with three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
3 And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon, beside the road. But David was staying in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul had come after him into the wilderness,
4 David sent out spies and learned that Saul had indeed come.


5 Then David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul was lying in the encampment, and the people were encamped around him.
6 Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, “Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?” Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”
7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and there lay Saul sleeping inside the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the people lay around him.
8 Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day. Now, please let me strike him with the spear to the ground with one stroke; I will not strike him twice.”
9 But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him. For who can stretch out his hand against the LORD’s anointed and be guiltless?”
10 And David said, “As the LORD lives, the LORD will strike him down, or his day will come to die, or he will go down into battle and perish.
11 The LORD forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed. But now take the spear that is at his head and the jar of water, and let us go.”
12 So David took the spear and the jar of water from beside Saul’s head, and they went away. No man saw it or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.


13 Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on the top of the hill far off, with a great space between them.
14 And David called to the people and to Abner son of Ner, saying, “Will you not answer, Abner?” And Abner answered, “Who are you who calls to the king?”
15 David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king.
16 This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your master, the LORD’s anointed. Now see where the king’s spear is and the jar of water that was at his head.”


17 Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord the king.”
18 And he said, “Why does my lord pursue his servant? For what have I done? What evil is in my hand?
19 Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is the LORD who has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering. But if it is men, cursed are they before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day so that I may have no share in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’
20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of the LORD, for the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea, just as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”


21 Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no longer harm you, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have acted foolishly and have made a serious mistake.”
22 David answered and said, “Here is the king’s spear. Let one of the young men come over and take it.
23 The LORD repays every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness, for the LORD gave you into my hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed.
24 Behold, as your life was highly valued in my eyes this day, so may my life be highly valued in the eyes of the LORD, and may He deliver me out of all tribulation.”
25 Then Saul said to David, “Blessed are you, my son David; you will both do great things and will also prevail.” So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.




Chapter 27


1 David said in his heart, “Now I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.”
2 So David arose and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath.
3 And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each with his household, even David with his two wives—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
4 And when it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, he no longer sought him.


5 Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be given to me in one of the country towns, that I may dwell there. Why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?”
6 So that day Achish gave him Ziklag. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
7 And the number of days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.


8 Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites. For those were the inhabitants of the land from ancient times, as you go to Shur and as far as the land of Egypt.
9 And David struck the land and left neither man nor woman alive, but took the sheep and cattle and donkeys and camels and garments, and returned and came to Achish.
10 And Achish said, “Where have you made a raid today?” And David said, “Against the Negev of Judah,” or “Against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites,” or “Against the Negev of the Kenites.”
11 David left neither man nor woman alive to bring news to Gath, thinking, “Lest they tell about us and say, ‘This is what David did.’” Such was his custom all the days he lived in the country of the Philistines.
12 And Achish trusted David, saying, “He has surely made himself utterly hated by his people Israel; therefore he will be my servant forever.”




Chapter 28


1 Now it happened in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies for war to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “Know for certain that you will go out with me in the army, you and your men.”
2 David said to Achish, “Very well, you shall know what your servant can do.” Achish said to David, “Then I will make you my bodyguard permanently.”


3 Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land.
4 The Philistines gathered and came and encamped at Shunem, and Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa.
5 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
6 And Saul inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets.


7 Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.” His servants said to him, “Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at En-dor.”
8 So Saul disguised himself and put on other garments and went, he and two men with him. And they came to the woman by night. And he said, “Please divine for me by a spirit, and bring up for me whomever I shall name to you.”
9 But the woman said to him, “Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the spiritists from the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life, to bring about my death?”
10 But Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, “As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.”


11 Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” And he said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”
12 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”
13 The king said to her, “Do not be afraid. What do you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I see a spiritual being coming up out of the earth.”
14 He said to her, “What is his appearance?” And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.” And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.


15 Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul answered, “I am greatly distressed, for the Philistines are warring against me, and God has turned away from me and does not answer me anymore, either by prophets or by dreams. Therefore I have called you, to make known to me what I should do.”
16 Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has turned from you and become your enemy?
17 The LORD has done to you as He spoke by me, for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David.
18 Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD and did not carry out His fierce wrath against Amalek, the LORD has done this thing to you this day.
19 Moreover, the LORD will give Israel along with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me. The LORD will give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.”


20 Then Saul fell at once full length on the ground, filled with fear because of the words of Samuel. There was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.
21 The woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly terrified, and she said to him, “Behold, your servant has obeyed you. I have taken my life in my hands and listened to what you have said to me.
22 Now, therefore, please obey your servant. Let me set a morsel of bread before you, that you may eat and have strength when you go on your way.”
23 But he refused and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman, urged him, and he listened to their words. So he arose from the ground and sat on the bed.


24 Now the woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she hurried and killed it. And she took flour and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread from it.
25 She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.




Chapter 29


1 Now the Philistines gathered all their armies at Aphek, and Israel was encamped by the spring that is in Jezreel.
2 The lords of the Philistines were passing by with units of hundreds and thousands, and David and his men were passing by in the rear with Achish.
3 Then the commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, “Is this not David, the servant of Saul king of Israel, who has been with me these many days or years? I have found no fault in him from the day he defected to me to this day.”
4 But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him, and the commanders of the Philistines said to him, “Send the man back, that he may return to the place you have assigned him. He shall not go down with us to battle, lest he become an adversary to us during the battle. For what better way for this man to reconcile himself to his master, except with the heads of our men?
5 Is this not David, of whom they sing in dances, saying,
‘Saul has struck down his thousands,
and David his ten of thousands’?”


6 Then Achish called David and said to him, “As the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight. For I have not found evil in you from the day of your coming to me until this day. Nevertheless, the other leaders do not approve of you.
7 So return now and go in peace, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.”


8 But David said to Achish, “What have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day I entered your service until now, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”
9 Achish answered David and said, “I know that you are as pleasing in my sight as an angel of God. Nevertheless, the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.’
10 Now then rise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you, and as soon as you rise early in the morning and have light, depart.”
11 So David rose early, he and his men, to depart in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel.




Chapter 30


1 Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid against the Negev and against Ziklag. They had struck Ziklag and burned it with fire,
2 and taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They killed no one, but carried them off and went on their way.
3 When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned with fire, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
4 Then David and the men who were with him lifted up their voices and wept until they had no strength to weep.
5 David’s two wives also had been taken captive, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
6 And David was greatly distressed, for the men spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the men was bitter, every man for his sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.


7 David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
8 And David inquired of the LORD, “Shall I pursue after this band? Shall I overtake them?” He answered him, “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake and shall surely rescue.”
9 So David set out, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.
10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men. Two hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor.


11 They found an Egyptian in the open country and brought him to David. They gave him bread and he ate. They gave him water to drink,
12 and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit revived, for he had eaten no bread and drunk no water for three days and three nights.
13 Then David said to him, “To whom do you belong? And where are you from?” He said, “I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite. My master left me behind because I fell sick three days ago.
14 We had made a raid against the Negev of the Cherethites and against that which belongs to Judah and against the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.”
15 And David said to him, “Will you take me down to these raiders?” And he said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to these raiders.”


16 When he had taken him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
17 And David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day, and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who mounted camels and fled.
18 David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.
19 Nothing was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken. David brought back everything.
20 David also captured all the flocks and herds, and the men drove the livestock before him and said, “This is David’s spoil.”


21 Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David, and who had been left at the brook Besor. They went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. And when David came near to the people, he greeted them.
22 Then all the wicked and worthless men among those who had gone with David said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except that each may lead away his wife and children, and depart.”
23 But David said, “You shall not do so, my brothers, with what the LORD has given us. He has preserved us and given into our hand the raiders that came against us.
24 Who would listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage. They shall share alike.”
25 And from that day forward he made it a statute and a rule for Israel to this day.


26 When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the spoil to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, “Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD.”
27 It was for those in Bethel, in Ramoth of the Negev, in Jattir,
28 in Aroer, in Siphmoth, in Eshtemoa,
29 in Racal, in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, in the cities of the Kenites,
30 in Hormah, in Bor-ashan, in Athach,
31 in Hebron, and for all the places where David and his men had roamed.




Chapter 31


1 Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
2 The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
3 The battle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was badly wounded by the archers.
4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that these uncircumcised do not come and attack me and mistreat me.” But his armor-bearer would not, for he was very afraid. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.
6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his men on the same day together.


7 When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and lived in them.
8 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
9 They cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the houses of their idols and to the people.
10 They put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.


11 But when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
12 all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan. And they came to Jabesh and burned them there.
13 They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh and fasted seven days.﻿Second Samuel


Chapter 1


1 Now, after the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites, David remained in Ziklag for two days.
2 And on the third day, a man came from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and dust on his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and bowed.
3 Then David said to him, “Where have you come from?” And he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”
4 And David said to him, “Tell me how the battle went.” And he answered, “The people have fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead. Saul and Jonathan, his son, have also died.”
5 Then David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead?”
6 And the young man who told him said, “By chance, I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and I saw Saul leaning on his spear. And the chariots and the horsemen had overtaken him.
7 When he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me, and I said, ‘Here I am.’
8 And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ And I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’
9 And he said to me, ‘Stand over me and kill me, for I am in severe pain and agony, though my life still lingers in me.’
10 So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that he would not live much longer. And I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”


11 Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, all the men who were with him did so as well.
12 And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan, his son, and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had been killed in the battle.


13 Then David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?” And he answered, “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”
14 And David said to him, “How is it you were not afraid to stretch out your hand to kill the LORD’s anointed?”
15 Then David called one of the young men and said, “Go, strike him down.” And he struck him so that he died.
16 And David said to him, “Your blood be upon your own head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the LORD’s anointed.’”


17 Then David lamented over Saul and over Jonathan, his son.
18 And he commanded that the sons of Judah be taught the Song of the Bow; as it is written in the Book of Jashar:


19 “Your glory, O Israel, is slain on your high places!  
How the mighty have fallen!  
20 Tell it not in Gath,  
Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon,  
Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,  
Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised gloat.


21 O mountains of Gilboa,  
Let there be no dew or rain upon you,  
Nor fields of offerings;  
For there the shield of the mighty was defiled,  
The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.


22 From the blood of the slain,  
From the fat of the mighty,  
The bow of Jonathan did not turn back,  
And the sword of Saul did not return empty.


23 Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their lives,  
And in their death they were not divided;  
They were swifter than eagles,  
They were stronger than lions.


24 O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,  
Who clothed you in scarlet with luxury,  
Who adorned your apparel with ornaments of gold.


25 How the mighty have fallen  
In the midst of the battle!  
Jonathan lies slain on your high places.


26 I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;  
Very pleasant have you been to me;  
Your love to me was extraordinary,  
Surpassing the love of women.


27 How the mighty have fallen,  
And the weapons of war have perished!”




Chapter 2


1 After this, David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?” And the LORD said to him, “Go up.” Then David said, “To which shall I go up?” And He said, “To Hebron.”
2 So David went there, with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
3 And David brought up his men who were with him, each with his household, and they dwelt in the towns of Hebron.
4 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, “The men of Jabesh-gilead buried Saul.”
5 So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, “Blessed are you of the LORD, because you have shown this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him.
6 Now may the LORD show kindness and truth to you, and I also will repay you this kindness, because you have done this thing.
7 Now therefore let your hands be strong and valiant, for your lord Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”


8 But Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, took Ish-bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.
9 And he made him king over Gilead and over the Ashurites and over Jezreel and over Ephraim and over Benjamin, even over all Israel.
10 Ish-bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
11 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.


12 And Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
13 And Joab son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down on opposite sides of the pool.
14 And Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men arise and compete before us.” And Joab said, “Let them arise.”
15 Then they arose and passed over by number: twelve for Benjamin and for Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
16 And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into his opponent’s side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called the Field of Sharp Swords, which is in Gibeon.
17 And the battle was very severe that day: Abner and the men of Israel were beaten by David's army.


18 The three sons of Zeruiah were present: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was a fast runner, like one of the gazelles in the field.
19 And Asahel pursued Abner, not turning to the right or to the left from following Abner.
20 Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” And he answered, “It is I.”
21 And Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right or to your left, and seize one of the other young men and take his armor.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
22 So Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I look your brother, Joab, in the eye?”
23 But he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner struck him with the butt of the spear in the belly, so that the spear came out behind him, and he fell there and died in that place. Everyone who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died stood still.


24 But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
25 And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and formed one band and stood on the top of a hill.
26 Then Abner called out to Joab and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell the people to turn back from pursuing their brothers?”
27 And Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the people would have continued until the morning, each attacking his brother.”
28 So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people stopped pursuing Israel, and they discontinued the fight.


29 Then Abner and his men went through the Arabah all that night, and they crossed the Jordan and walked all morning, until arriving in Mahanaim.
30 And Joab returned from following Abner, and when he had gathered all the people together, they counted nineteen men, plus Asahel as missing from David's army.
31 But the soldiers of David had struck down and killed three hundred and sixty men of Benjamin and of Abner’s men.
32 And they took Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which is in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night, arriving in Hebron at dawn.




Chapter 3


1 There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.


2 Sons were born to David at Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
3 and his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
4 and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
5 and the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David at Hebron.


6 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was strengthening himself in the house of Saul.
7 Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”
8 Then Abner became very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, “Am I a dog’s head of Judah? To this day I have shown loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David, and yet you accuse me today with a matter concerning this woman?
9 May God do so to Abner and more also, if I do not accomplish for David what the LORD has sworn to him:
10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba!”
11 And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.


12 Then Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, “To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel to your side.”
13 And he said, “Agreed. I will make a covenant with you, but I will require this one thing of you: You shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, the daughter of Saul, when you come to see my face.”
14 Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”
15 So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.
16 But her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go, return.” And he returned.


17 Now Abner held counsel with the elders of Israel, saying, “In times past you sought David to be king over you.
18 Now then, make it happen, for the LORD has spoken concerning David, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.’”
19 Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin, and Abner went also to speak in the hearing of David at Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin.


20 So Abner came to David at Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
21 Then Abner said to David, “I will arise and go and gather all Israel to my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.


22 Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
23 When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”
24 Then Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Did Abner come to you? Why is it that you have sent him away so that he is gone?
25 You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, to know your going out and your coming in and to know all that you are doing.”


26 When Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah. But David did not know it.
27 And when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the belly so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
28 When David afterward heard of it, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD for the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
29 Let it fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house. And may there never fail from the house of Joab one who has a discharge or who is a leper or who walks with a staff or who falls by the sword or who lacks bread.”
30 So Joab and Abishai, his brother, killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.


31 Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David followed the bier.
32 They buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
33 And the king lamented over Abner and said, “Should Abner die as a fool dies?
34 Your hands were not bound; your feet were not put in fetters; as a man falls before wicked men, so you fell.” And all the people wept again over him.
35 Then all the people came to persuade David to eat food while it was still day, but David swore, saying, “May God do so to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else until the sun goes down!”


36 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as everything the king did pleased all the people.
37 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king’s will to kill Abner the son of Ner.
38 And the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
39 And I am this day weak, though anointed king. These sons of Zeruiah are too harsh for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his wickedness.”




Chapter 4


1 When Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner had died at Hebron, his hands grew weak, and all Israel was dismayed.
2 Now Saul’s son had two men who were captains of raiding bands; their names were Baanah and Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the tribe of Benjamin—for Beeroth also is counted as part of Benjamin,
3 though the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have lived there as foreigners to this day.


4 Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame in both feet. He was five years old when the report of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse picked him up and fled. And as she fled in haste, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.


5 Then the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went and came at the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he was lying on his bed at noon.


6 They came into the middle of the house as if to get wheat, and they struck him in the belly. Then Rechab and Baanah, his brother, escaped.
7 When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and killed him and beheaded him. Then they took his head and traveled by the way of the Arabah all night.
8 And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. The LORD has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his descendents.”


9 But David answered Rechab and Baanah, his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from every distress,
10 when one told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ thinking he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag—which was the reward I gave him for his news.
11 How much more when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed? Now shall I not require his blood at your hand and destroy you from the earth?”
12 And David commanded his young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.




Chapter 5


1 Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
2 In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the LORD said to you, ‘You shall shepherd My people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.’”
3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel.
4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
5 At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and at Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.


6 Then the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. They said to David, “You shall not come in here, but the blind and the lame will turn you away”—thinking, “David cannot come in here.”
7 Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion—that is, the city of David.


8 And David said on that day, “Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him go up through the water shaft to attack the lame and the blind, who are hated by David’s soul.” Therefore it is said, “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.”
9 So David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. And David built all around from the Millo and inward.
10 David became greater and greater, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.


11 Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar trees, and carpenters and masons, and they built a house for David.
12 And David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.


13 David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he had come from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David.
14 These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.


17 When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek out David. But David heard of it and went down to the stronghold.
18 Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.
19 So David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You give them into my hand?” And the LORD said to David, “Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand.”
20 So David came to Baal-perazim, and there he defeated them there. And he said, “The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like the breakthrough of waters.” Therefore he named that place Baal-perazim.
21 And they left their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.


22 Then the Philistines came up once again and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim.
23 When David inquired of the LORD, He said, “You shall not go up; circle around behind them and come against them opposite the balsam trees.
24 And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall act quickly, for then the LORD will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”
25 So David did as the LORD had commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer.




Chapter 6


1 David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
2 And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD of hosts who is enthroned above the cherubim.
3 They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart.
4 They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, with the ark of God, and Ahio was walking in front of the ark.
5 David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of instruments made of fir wood, with lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.


6 When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out toward the ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen stumbled.
7 And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and God struck him there for the irreverence, and he died there beside the ark of God.


8 David was angry because the LORD had broken out against Uzzah, and that place is called Perez-uzzah to this day.
9 So David was afraid of the LORD that day, and he said, “How can the ark of the LORD come to me?”


10 David was not willing to bring the ark of the LORD to himself in the city of David. Instead, David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
11 The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household.


12 It was reported to King David, saying, “The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him because of the ark of God.” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with joy.
13 When those who bore the ark of the LORD had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened animal.


14 David was dancing before the LORD with all his might, and David was wearing a linen ephod.
15 So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.


16 Now it happened, as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
17 They brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
18 When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
19 He distributed to all the people, to the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a raisin cake to each one. Then all the people departed, each to his house.


20 David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, “How the king of Israel distinguished himself today, uncovering himself today in the sight of the servant-maids of his servants, as one of the vulgar fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!”
21 So David said to Michal, “It was before the LORD, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel. Therefore I will celebrate before the LORD.
22 I will be more lightly esteemed than this and will humble myself in my own eyes, but with the servant-maids of whom you have spoken, with them I will be honored.”
23 And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.




Chapter 7


1 Now when the king lived in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him,
2 the king said to Nathan the prophet, “Consider this: I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent.”
3 And Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.”


4 But that night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,
5 “Go and say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD: Would you build Me a house for Me to dwell in?
6 For I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the sons of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent for My dwelling.
7 In all the places where I have moved with all the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, “Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?”’”


8 Therefore, this is what you shall say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people, over Israel.
9 And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.
10 And I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place and not be disturbed anymore. And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly,
11 even from the day that I commanded judges over My people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house.
12 When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
13 He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
14 I will be to him a father, and he shall be to Me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men;
15 but My steadfast love shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.
16 And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before Me. Your throne shall be established forever.’”
17 Nathan spoke to David in accordance with all these words and in accordance with the entire vision.


18 Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and said, “Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
19 And yet this was a small thing in Your eyes, O Lord GOD. You have spoken also of Your servant’s house for a great while to come, and this is instruction for mankind, O Lord GOD!
20 And what more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, O Lord GOD!
21 Because of Your word and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, to make Your servant know it.
22 Therefore You are great, O LORD God! For there is none like You, and there is no God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
23 And who is like Your people Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem to be His people, to make a name for Himself, and to do for them great and awesome things by driving out nations and their gods before Your people, whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt?


24 And You established for Yourself Your people Israel to be Your people forever. And You, O LORD, became their God.
25 And now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, and do as You have spoken.
26 And Your name shall be magnified forever, saying, ‘The LORD of hosts is God over Israel,’ and the house of Your servant David shall be established before You.
27 For You, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed this to Your servant, saying, ‘I will build you a house.’ Therefore Your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to You.
28 And now, O Lord GOD, You are God, and Your words are true, and You have promised this good thing to Your servant.
29 Now therefore may it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You. For You, O Lord GOD, have spoken, and with Your blessing shall the house of Your servant be blessed forever.”




Chapter 8


1 After this David struck down the Philistines and subdued them, and David took Metheg-ammah from the hand of the Philistines.


2 And he struck down Moab, and measured them with a line, making them lie down on the ground. Two lines he measured to be put to death, and one full line to be spared. And the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute.


3 David also struck down Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to restore his power at the Euphrates River.
4 And David took from him 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses but left enough of them for a hundred chariots.
5 And the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, but David struck down 22,000 men of the Arameans.
6 Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
7 And David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
8 And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a large amount of bronze.


9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck down all the army of Hadadezer,
10 then Toi sent his son Joram to King David, to greet him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him—for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi. And Joram brought with him articles of silver, of gold, and of bronze.
11 These also King David dedicated to the LORD, together with the silver and gold that he dedicated from all the nations he subdued:
12 from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.


13 And David made a name for himself when he returned from striking down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
14 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became David’s servants. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.


15 So David reigned over all Israel, and David administered justice and righteousness to all his people.
16 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
17 and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests; and Seraiah was secretary;
18 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were priests.




Chapter 9


1 Then David said, “Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”
2 A servant of the house of Saul named Ziba was there, and they called him to David. And the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” And he said, “I am your servant.”
3 The king said, “Is there someone of the house of Saul still living, that I may show the kindness of God to him?” And Ziba said to the king, “A son of Jonathan still lives and he is crippled in his feet.”
4 The king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba said to the king, “He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.”
5 Then King David sent for him and had him brought from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.


6 And Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and paid homage. And David said, “Mephibosheth!” And he answered, “Behold, I am your servant.”
7 And David said to him, “Do not be afraid, for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your grandfather, and you shall always eat at my table.”
8 And he paid homage and said, “What is your servant, that you should look upon a dead dog such as I?”


9 Then the king called Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master’s grandson.
10 And you shall till the land for him, you and your sons and your servants, and you shall bring in the harvest, that your master’s grandson may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, shall always eat at my table.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
11 Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands to his servant, so will your servant do.” So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table like one of the king’s sons.
12 And Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. And all who lived in Ziba’s house became Mephibosheth’s servants.
13 So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he always ate at the king’s table. Now he was lame in both his feet.




Chapter 10


1 After this, the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.
2 And David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father. But when David’s servants came into the land of the Ammonites,
3 the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David is honoring your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn't David sent his servants to you in order to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?”
4 So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved off half of each man’s beard, and cut off their garments in the middle at the hips, and sent them away.
5 When they told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were very embarrassed. And the king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”


6 When the Ammonites saw that they had become odious to David, the Ammonites sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob and the Arameans of Zobah, twenty thousand foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men of Tob, twelve thousand men.
7 When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the host of mighty men.
8 And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of the gate, and the Arameans of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.


9 When Joab saw that the battle line was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best of Israel and set them in array against the Arameans.
10 The rest of the troops he put in the hand of Abishai, his brother, and he set them in array against the Ammonites.
11 And he said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to help you.
12 But be strong, and let us show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good in His sight.”


13 So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him.
14 And when the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they also ran away before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and returned to Jerusalem.


15 But when the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they regrouped.
16 And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the River, and they came to Helam, with Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer leading them.
17 When David was informed about this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan and came to Helam. And the Arameans set themselves in array against David and fought with him.
18 But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed of the Arameans, the men of seven hundred chariots and forty thousand horsemen, and he struck down Shobach the commander of their army, who died there.
19 And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.




Chapter 11


1 And it came to pass at the turn of the year, at the time when kings go out to war, that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel, and they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.


2 And it came to pass in the evening that David rose from his bed and walked about on the roof of the king’s house. From the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful in appearance.
3 So David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, “Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?”
4 Then David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her (she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness). Then she returned to her house.
5 And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, saying, “I am pregnant.”


6 Then David sent to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent Uriah to David.
7 When Uriah came to him, David asked about Joab’s welfare and the welfare of the people and the progress of the war.
8 Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” And Uriah went out from the king’s house, and a gift from the king followed him.
9 But Uriah slept at the entrance of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord and did not go down to his house.
10 When they told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?”
11 And Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are housed in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Should I go to my house to eat, drink and lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do so.”
12 Then David said to Uriah, “Remain here today, tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next.
13 Now David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, and he made him drunk. In the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.


14 And it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
15 And he wrote in the letter, saying, “Place Uriah at the front of the fiercest battle, and then draw back from him, so that he may be struck down and die.”


16 So as Joab besieged the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men.
17 Then the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, and some of the servants of David fell, and Uriah the Hittite also died.


18 Then Joab sent and reported to David all the events of the war.
19 And he instructed the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling the events of the war to the king,
20 and if it happens that the king’s wrath rises, and he says to you, ‘Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know they would shoot from the wall?
21 Who struck Abimelek, the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn’t a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’—then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’”


22 So the messenger went and came and reported to David all that Joab had sent him to tell.
23 And the messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.
24 Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall, and some of the king’s servants died. Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.”


25 Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab: ‘Do not let this matter trouble you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your battle against the city and overthrow it.’ And encourage him.”


26 When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.
27 And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But what David had done was evil in the LORD’s sight.




Chapter 12


1 Then the LORD sent Nathan who went to David and said, “There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor.
2 The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
3 but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb that he had bought. He nourished it, and it grew up with him and with his children. It ate his food, drank from his cup, and lay in his bosom—it was like a daughter to him.
4 Now a traveler came to the rich man, but he was unwilling to take from his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him. Instead, he took the poor man’s ewe lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”


5 Then David became very angry at the man, and said to Nathan, “As the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die.
6 For his actions and because he had no pity, he must repay fourfold for the lamb.”
7 Then Nathan said to David, “You are that man! Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
8 I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your bosom. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah, and if that had been too little, I would have added to you much more.
9 Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in His sight? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword—killing him with the sword of the Ammonites—then you took his wife for yourself.
10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’
11 Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own house. And before your very eyes, I will take your wives and give them to your companion, who will lie with your wives in broad daylight.
12 For you did this in secret, but I will do it before all Israel and in public.’”


13 Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” And Nathan said to David, “The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.
14 However, because you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, on account of your actions, the child that is born to you shall surely die.”
15 Then Nathan went to his house.


And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it became very sick.
16 Therefore, David appealed to God for the child, fasting and laying all night on the ground.
17 The elders of his house stood beside him to raise him from the ground, but he would not, nor would he eat food with them.
18 On the seventh day the child died. The servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Look, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to our voice. How then can we say to him, ‘The child is dead’? He might do something harmful.”


19 But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, he perceived that the child had died. So David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” And they said, “He is dead.”
20 Then David rose from the ground, washed and anointed himself, changed his clothes, and came into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house. When he asked, they set food before him, and he ate.


21 Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child died, you arose and ate food.”
22 He said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, ‘Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me, that the child may live.’
23 But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”


24 Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife and went in to her and lay with her, and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him,
25 and He sent a message by the hand of Nathan the prophet. So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.


26 Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city.
27 Then Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah and have taken the city of waters.
28 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, encamp against the city, and capture it, lest I capture the city and call it by my own name.”
29 So David gathered all the people, went to Rabbah, fought against it, and captured it.
30 Then he took the crown of their king from his head—its weight was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone—and it was placed on David’s head. He also brought out the spoil of the city in great abundance.
31 He brought out the people who were in it and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes, and he made them work in the brick kilns. He treated all the cities of the Ammonites in the same manner. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.




Chapter 13


1 Now it came about after this that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister named Tamar, and Amnon the son of David loved her.
2 Amnon was so distressed over his sister Tamar that he made himself ill, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for Amnon to do anything to her.
3 But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother. And Jonadab was a very crafty man.
4 He said to him, “Why are you, the king’s son, so dejected morning after morning? Will you not tell me?” Then Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.”
5 Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me something to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, so that I may see it and eat from her hand.’”


6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”
7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house and prepare food for him.”
8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, and he was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
9 She took the pan and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, “Have everyone leave me.” So everyone left him.
10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, so I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon.


11 When she brought them near for him to eat, he grabbed her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.”
12 But she answered him, “No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this disgraceful thing!
13 And I—where could I take my reproach? And you—you would be like one of the fools in Israel. Now please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.”
14 But he refused to listen to her, and being stronger, he violated her and lay with her.


15 Then Amnon hated her immensely, so much so, that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Get up, get out!”
16 But she said to him, “No, because the wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me.” But he would not listen to her.
17 Then he called his young servant who attended him and said, “Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her.”
18 Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves, for thus were the virgin daughters of the king clothed in earlier times. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her.
19 Tamar put ashes on her head, tore the long robe she was wearing, laid her hand on her head, and went away, crying aloud as she went.


20 Her brother Absalom said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now, my sister, be quiet. He is your brother. Do not take this matter to heart.” So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom’s house.
21 When King David heard about all these things, he was very angry.
22 But Absalom did not speak with Amnon either good or bad, because Absalom hated Amnon for violating his sister, Tamar.


23 Two years later, Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.
24 Absalom came to the king and said, “Your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.”
25 But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be a burden to you.” Though he urged him, he would not go, but gave him his blessing.
26 Then Absalom said, “If not you, rhen please let my brother Amnon go with us.” The king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”
27 But Absalom urged him, so he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.


28 Absalom commanded his servants, “Watch now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be strong and be valiant.”
29 The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons rose and each mounted his mule and fled.


30 While they were on the way, a report came to David, “Absalom has struck down all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left.”
31 The king arose, tore his garments, and lay on the ground, and all his servants standing by tore their garments.
32 But Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, said, “Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king’s sons, for only Amnon is dead. For by Absalom’s command this has been determined from the day he violated his sister Tamar.
33 So now, let not my lord the king take the matter to heart, thinking all the king’s sons are dead, for Amnon alone is dead.”


34 But Absalom fled. Now the watchman lifted his eyes and looked, and saw many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain.
35 Jonadab said to the king, “See! The king’s sons have come. As your servant said, so it has happened.”
36 As he finished speaking, the king’s sons came and lifted up their voices and wept. The king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.


37 But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son day after day.
38 So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and he was there for three years.
39 And the spirit of the king longed to go out to Absalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.




Chapter 14


1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.
2 So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there. He said to her, “Please pretend to be in mourning and put on mourning garments. Do not anoint yourself with oil, but act like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead.
3 Then go in to the king and speak to him in this way.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.


4 When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said, “Help, O king!”


5 The king said to her, “What troubles you?” And she said, “Indeed, I am a widow; my husband is dead.
6 And your maidservant had two sons. And the two of them fought in the field, and there was no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him.
7 And now the whole clan has risen up against your maidservant, and they say, ‘Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed.’ So they would destroy the heir also. Thus they would quench my coal which is left and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.”


8 Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.”


9 And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord the king, let the iniquity be on me and on my father’s house, and the king and his throne be guiltless.”


10 And the king said, “If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you anymore.”


11 Then she said, “Please let the king remember the LORD your God, so that the avenger of blood may not destroy anymore, lest they destroy my son.” And he said, “As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.”
12 Then the woman said, “Please let your maidservant speak a word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Speak.”
13 And the woman said, “Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring back his banished one.
14 For we must die, and are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God does not take away life; rather, he devises plans so that the banished one may not remain cast out.
15 And now I have come to speak this thing to my lord the king, because the people have made me afraid. And your maidservant said, ‘Let me now speak to the king; perhaps the king will perform the request of his maidservant.
16 For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.’
17 Then your maidservant said, ‘May the word of my lord the king bring rest.’ For as the angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil. And may the LORD your God be with you.”


18 Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Do not hide from me anything that I ask you.” And the woman said, “Let my lord the king speak.”


19 And the king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” And the woman answered and said, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. For your servant Joab commanded me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant.
20 In order to change the appearance of the matter your servant Joab has done this thing. But my lord is wise, as wise as the angel of God, to know all that is in the earth.”


21 Then the king said to Joab, “Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.”


22 And Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and blessed the king. And Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, because the king has done the word of his servant.”


23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
24 But the king said, “Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house and did not see the king’s face.


25 Now in all Israel there was no man praised as much for his beauty as Absalom; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
26 And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he cut it, because it was heavy on him, so he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels by the royal weight.
27 And to Absalom were born three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a woman of beautiful appearance.
28 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, but he did not see the king’s face.
29 Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. So he sent again a second time, but he would not come.
30 Therefore he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
31 Then Joab arose and came to Absalom at his house and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”
32 And Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, so that I may send you to the king to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would have been better for me to still be there.”’ Now therefore, let me see the king’s face. And if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.”
33 So Joab went to the king and told him. And he called for Absalom, and he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.




Chapter 15


1 After this, Absalom prepared for himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
2 Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way to the gate. Whenever any man had a dispute to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, “From what city are you?” And he would say, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”
3 Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your claims are good and right, but there is no one assigned by the king to hear you.”
4 And Absalom would say, “Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a dispute or cause could come to me, and I would give him justice.”


5 And whenever a man came near to pay homage to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.
6 Absalom did this to all the Israelites who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
7 At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow that I have vowed to the LORD in Hebron.
8 For your servant vowed a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If the LORD will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will worship the LORD in Hebron.’”
9 The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose and went to Hebron.


10 But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’”
11 With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited guests, and they went in their innocence, knowing nothing.
12 And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city, from Giloh. And the conspiracy grew strong, and the people with Absalom kept increasing.


13 A messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.”
14 Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee, or else none of us will escape from Absalom. Go quickly, lest he overtake us quickly and bring down disaster on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”
15 The king’s servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses.”
16 So the king went out, and all his household after him. But the king left ten concubines to keep the house.


17 And the king went out, and all the people after him. They halted at the last house.
18 And all his servants passed by him, and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath passed on before the king.
19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why do you also go with us? Return and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your home.
20 You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, since I go where I must go? Return, and take back your brothers with you, and may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you.”


21 But Ittai answered the king, “As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, there also will your servant be.”
22 David said to Ittai, “Go then, pass on.” So Ittai the Gittite passed on with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.
23 And all the land wept aloud as all the people passed by, and the king crossed the brook Kidron, and all the people passed on toward the way of the wilderness.
24 And behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, until all the people had finished passing out of the city.
25 Then the king said to Zadok, “Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me back and let me see both it and his dwelling place.
26 But if he says, ‘I have no delight in you,’ behold, here I am; let him do to me what seems good to him.”


27 The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, you and Abiathar with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
28 See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”


29 So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.
30 But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, barefoot and with his head covered. And all the people who were with him covered their heads, and they went up, weeping as they went.
31 And it was told David, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” And David said, “O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.”
32 When David came to the summit, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and dirt on his head.
33 David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.
34 But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father’s servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,’ then you will defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me.
35 Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So whatever you hear from the king’s house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
36 Behold, their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son. By them you shall send to me everything you hear.”
37 So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.




Chapter 16


1 When David had passed a little beyond the summit, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs, and a skin of wine.
2 The king said to Ziba, “Why have you brought these?” Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those who faint in the wilderness to drink.”
3 The king said, “And where is your master’s son?” Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father.’”
4 Then the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.” Ziba said, “I pay homage; let me find favor in your sight, my lord the king.”


5 When King David came to Bahurim, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera, and he came out cursing continuously as he came.
6 He threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David. And all the people and all the mighty men were on his right and on his left.
7 Shimei said as he cursed, “Get out, get out, you man of blood, you worthless man!
8 The LORD has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, your evil is upon you, for you are a man of blood.”
9 Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.”
10 But the king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, and if the LORD has told him, ‘Curse David,’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’”
11 David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Leave him alone, and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.
12 It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing today.”
13 So David and his men went on the road, while Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and flung dust.


14 The king and all the people who were with him arrived weary at the Jordan, and there he refreshed himself.


15 Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.
16 When Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
17 Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”
18 Hushai said to Absalom, “No, for whomever the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel choose, his I will be, and with him I will remain.
19 Again, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have served your father, so I will serve you.”


20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel. What shall we do?”
21 Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines whom he has left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.”
22 So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.


23 Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel esteemed, both by David and by Absalom.




Chapter 17


1 Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight.
2 I will come upon him while he is weary and weak, and I will startle him. All the people who are with him will flee, and I will strike down the king alone.
3 And I will bring all the people back to you as a bride returns to her husband. You seek the life of only one man, and all the people will be at peace.”


4 The proposal pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
5 Then Absalom said, “Call also Hushai the Archite, and let us hear what he has to say.”
6 When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, “Ahithophel has spoken in this manner. Shall we do as he says? If not, speak.”


7 Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.”
8 Hushai added, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are enraged in their minds like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. And your father is a man of war; he will not spend the night with the people.
9 Even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits or in some other place. And when some of the men fall at the first attack, whoever hears of it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.’
10 Then even the most valiant, with the heart of a lion, will utterly melt, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and those who are with him are valiant men.
11 Therefore I advise that all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as the sand by the sea in multitude, and that you yourself go into battle.
12 So shall we come upon him in whatever place he is found, and we shall fall on him as the dew falls on the ground. And of him and all the men with him not even one will be left.
13 If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it into the valley until not even a pebble can be found there.”
14 Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had ordained to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel so that the LORD might bring disaster upon Absalom.


15 Then Hushai sent word to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “This is how Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this was how I have counseled.
16 Now therefore send quickly and tell David, saying, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means cross over, lest the king and all the people with him be swallowed up.’”


17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, and a servant girl used to go and tell them, and they would go and tell King David, for they could not risk being seen entering the city.
18 But a lad saw them and told Absalom. So the two of them quickly departed and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into it.
19 And the woman spread a covering over the mouth of the well and scattered grain over it, and no one knew about it.
20 When Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house and said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” the woman said to them, “They have crossed over the brook.” And they searched but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.
21 After they had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, “Arise and cross quickly over the water, for thus Ahithophel has counseled against you.”
22 Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan. By the morning light, not one of them was left who had not crossed the Jordan.


23 When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and arose and went to his home, to his city. He set his house in order and hanged himself. So he died and was buried in the tomb of his father.


24 Then David came to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
25 Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who had married Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.
26 And Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.


27 When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,
28 brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,
29 honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd for David and the people who were with him to eat, for they said, “The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”




Chapter 18


1 Then David mustered the men who were with him, and he set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
2 David sent out the army: one-third under Joab’s leadership, one-third under Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and one-third under Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, “I will also go out with you myself.”
3 But the people said, “You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us, and if half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore it is better that you send us help from the city.”
4 The king said to them, “Whatever seems best in your eyes I will do.” So the king stood beside the gate while all the army went out by hundreds and by thousands.


5 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.” And all the people heard when the king commanded all the commanders concerning Absalom.
6 So the army went out into the field against Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
7 And the army of Israel was defeated there before the servants of David, and the slaughter there on that day was great—twenty thousand men.
8 The battle spread over the face of all the countryside, and the forest devoured more of the people that day than the sword devoured.
9 Absalom happened to meet the soldiers of David while riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak, and his head was caught in the oak branches, and he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him kept going.


10 A certain man saw it and told Joab, “Look, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.”
11 Joab said to the man who told him, “You saw him? Why then did you not strike him to the ground there? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a warrior’s belt.”
12 But the man said to Joab, “Even if I were to feel the weight of a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I would not put out my hand against the king’s son. For in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Watch over the young man Absalom for me.’
13 Otherwise, if I had dealt treacherously with his life—and there is nothing hidden from the king—you yourself would not have protected me.”
14 Then Joab said, “I will not wait like this with you.” So he took three javelins in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the midst of the oak.
15 And ten young men, Joab’s armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him and killed him.
16 Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the army returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained the people.
17 They took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled, each to his tent.


18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a pillar, which is in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to preserve my name.” So he called the pillar by his own name, and it is called Absalom’s Monument to this day.


19 Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me run and carry the news to the king that the LORD has vindicated him from the hand of his enemies.”
20 But Joab said to him, “You shall not be the bearer of news today. You shall bear news another day, but today you shall bear no news, because the king’s son is dead.”
21 Then Joab said to a Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” And the Cushite bowed before Joab and ran.
22 Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, “Whatever may come, let me also run after the Cushite.” Joab said, “Why will you run, my son, since you will have no reward for the news?”
23 “Whatever may come,” he said, “I will run.” So he said to him, “Run.” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and outran the Cushite.


24 Now David was sitting between the two gates, and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw a man was running alone.
25 The watchman called out and told the king. The king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” And he kept coming and drew nearer.
26 Then the watchman saw another man running. And the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, “i see another man running alone.” The king said, “He also brings news.”
27 The watchman said, “I think the first is running like Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” And the king said, “He is a good man and comes with good news.”
28 Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All is well.” And he bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.”


29 The king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I do not know what it was.”
30 The king said, “Turn aside and stand here.” So he turned aside and stood still.
31 And then, the Cushite arrived and said, “Good news for my lord the king! For the LORD has vindicated you this day from the hand of all who rose up against you.”
32 The king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” The Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you to do harm be like that young man.”


33 Then the king was deeply shaken. He went up to the upper chamber over the gate and wept. As he went, he said, “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would that I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”




Chapter 19


1 And it was told to Joab, “Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.”
2 And the victory on that day was turned into mourning for all the army, for the army heard it said that day, “The king is grieving for his son.”
3 And the people stole into the city that day, as people steal in, who are ashamed when they flee from a battle.
4 The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, “O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!”


5 Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, “Today you have put to shame the faces of all your servants, who have today saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and your concubines,
6 by loving those who hate you and hating those who love you. For you have made it clear today that commanders and servants are nothing to you. For today I know that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then it would have pleased you well.
7 Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants. For I swear by the LORD, if you do not go out, not a man will stay with you tonight. And this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.”
8 Then the king arose and sat in the gate. And all the people were told, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” And all the people came before the king.


Now Israel had fled, every man to his tent.
9 And all the people were arguing throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies and saved us from the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled out of the land because of Absalom.
10 But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore, why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?”


11 And King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests: “Say to the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his house, when the word of all Israel has come to the king, to bring him to his house?
12 You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?’
13 And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me and more also if you are not commander of the army before me always in place of Joab.’”
14 So he turned the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, so that they sent word to the king, “Return, both you and all your servants.”
15 So the king returned and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and to bring the king over the Jordan.
16 And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
17 And with him were a thousand men from Benjamin. And Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, with his fifteen sons and his twenty servants, rushed down to the Jordan before the king,
18 and they crossed the ford to bring over the king’s household and to do what was good in his sight.


And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was about to cross the Jordan,
19 and he said to the king, “Let not my lord impute guilt to me, or remember what your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. Let not the king take it to heart.
20 For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I have come this day, the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.”
21 Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, “Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s anointed?”
22 But David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be an adversary to me? Should any man be put to death in Israel this day? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?”
23 And the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king gave him his oath.


24 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. He had neither taken care of his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came back in peace.
25 And when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?”
26 He answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said to him, ‘Saddle a donkey for me, that I may ride on it and go with the king,’ for your servant is lame.
27 He has slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like the angel of God; do therefore what seems good to you.
28 For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king, yet you set your servant among those who eat at your table. What right then have I to cry any more to the king?”
29 And the king said to him, “Why speak any more of your affairs? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.”
30 And Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him take it all, since my lord the king has come safely to his own house.”


31 Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim. He went on with the king to the Jordan to escort him over the Jordan.
32 Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years old. He had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.
33 The king said to Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem.”
34 But Barzillai said to the king, “How many years have I still to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
35 I am this day eighty years old. Can I discern what is pleasant and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks? Can I still listen to the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
36 Your servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?
37 Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him go over with my lord the king, and do for him whatever seems good to you.”
38 And the king answered, “Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you, and all that you desire of me I will do for you.”


39 Then all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. And the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own place.
40 The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. All the people of Judah, and also half the people of Israel, brought the king on his way.
41 Then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to him, “Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?”
42 All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is our close relative. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s expense? Or has he given us any gift?”
43 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, “We have ten parts in the king, and in David also we have more than you. Why then did you despise us, that our advice was not first taken in bringing back our king?” But the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.




Chapter 20


1 Now there happened to be there a worthless man, whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. And he blew the trumpet and said, “We have no portion in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to his tents, O Israel!”
2 So all the men of Israel withdrew from following David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah remained steadfast to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
3 Then David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them in custody and provided for them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as widows.


4 Then the king said to Amasa, “Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and you be present here yourself.”
5 So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he delayed beyond the set time which he had appointed him.
6 And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take your lord’s servants and pursue him, lest he find for himself fortified cities and escape from our sight.”
7 And Joab’s men went out after him, along with the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men. They went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
8 When they were at the great stone that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was wearing a soldier’s garment, and over it was a belt with a sword fastened upon his loins in its sheath, and as he went forward, it fell out.
9 Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
10 But Amasa did not guard himself against the sword that was in Joab’s hand. So he struck him in the belly and poured out his entrails to the ground without a second blow, and he died.


Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.
11 And one of Joab’s young men stood by him and said, “Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab.”
12 And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stopped, he carried Amasa from the highway into the field and threw a garment over him, because he saw that everyone who came by him stopped.
13 When he was removed from the highway, all the men passed on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
14 And he passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah, and all the Bichrites were assembled and also went after him.
15 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart. And all the troops who were with Joab battered the wall to throw it down.


16 Then a wise woman called from the city, “Listen, listen! Say to Joab, ‘Come here, that I may speak to you.’”
17 He came near to her, and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” He answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your servant.” And he answered, “I am listening.”
18 Then she said, “They used to say in former times, ‘Let them ask advice at Abel,’ and so they settled a matter.
19 I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up the heritage of the LORD?”
20 Joab answered, “Far be it from me, far be it, that I should swallow up or destroy!
21 That is not true. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, named Sheba the son of Bichri, has lifted up his hand against King David. Give him up alone, and I will withdraw from the city.” And the woman said to Joab, “In that case, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.”


22 Then the woman in her wisdom went to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
23 Now Joab was over all the army of Israel. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites.
24 And Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder.
25 And Sheva was secretary, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests.
26 And Ira the Jairite was also priest to David.




Chapter 21


1 Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year. And David sought the face of the LORD, and the LORD said, “It is because of Saul and his bloody house, for he put the Gibeonites to death.”
2 So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the sons of Israel had sworn to them, but Saul had sought to strike them down in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah.)
3 David said to the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? And how shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?”
4 The Gibeonites said to him, “It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his house, nor is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.” And he said, “What you say, I will do for you.”
5 Then they said to the king, “The man who consumed us and plotted against us so that we were destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel—
6 let seven men of his sons be given to us, and we will hang them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD.” And the king said, “I will give them.”
7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the LORD that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
8 So the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
9 And he gave them into the hand of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the mountain before the LORD. So the seven of them fell together. They were put to death in the days of harvest, at the beginning of barley harvest.


10 Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water poured on them from the sky, and she did not allow the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day or the beasts of the field by night.
11 When it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done,
12 David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the open square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day the Philistines struck down Saul in Gilboa.
13 He brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged.
14 And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan, his son, in the land of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish, his father. They did all that the king commanded, and afterward God responded to the plea for the land.


15 Once again the Philistines made war with Israel. And David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David grew weary.
16 Then Ishbi-benob, who was of the descendants of the giants, whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of bronze and who was girded with a new sword, thought to strike David down.
17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall no longer go out with us to battle, so that you do not extinguish the lamp of Israel.”


18 After this there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was one of the descendants of the giants.
19 Again there was war with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite struck down Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
20 There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended from the giants.
21 And he defied Israel, but Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, struck him down.
22 These four were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.




Chapter 22


1 And David spoke to the LORD the words of this song on the day the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
2 He said, “The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer,
3 My God, my rock in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge, my savior—You save me from violence.
4 I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.
5 For the waves of death encompassed me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me;


6 The cords of Sheol surrounded me;
the snares of death confronted me.
7 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and to my God I cried out.
From His temple He heard my voice, and my cry came to His ears.
8 Then the earth shook and quaked;
the foundations of heaven trembled and were shaken,
because He was angry.


9 Smoke rose from His nostrils,
and devouring fire from His mouth;
coals were kindled by it.
10 He bowed the heavens and came down,
with thick darkness under His feet.
11 He rode upon a cherub and flew;
He was seen upon the wings of the wind.
12 He made darkness a canopy around Him,
gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
13 From the brightness before Him coals of fire were kindled.
14 The LORD thundered from heaven,
and the Most High uttered His voice.
15 He sent out arrows and scattered them,
lightning, and routed them.
16 Then the channels of the sea were seen,
the foundations of the world were laid bare,
by the rebuke of the LORD,
at the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
17 He sent from on high, He took me;
He drew me out of many waters.
18 He rescued me from my strong enemy,
from those who hated me,
for they were too mighty for me.
19 They confronted me in the day of my disaster,
but the LORD was my support.
20 He brought me out into a broad place;
He rescued me, for He delighted in me.
21 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness;
according to the cleanness of my hands He repaid me.
22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD
and have not wickedly departed from my God.
23 For all His rules were before me,
and His statutes I did not depart from.
24 I was blameless before Him
and kept myself from guilt.
25 Therefore the LORD repaid me according to my righteousness,
according to my cleanness in His sight.
26 With the loyal You show Yourself loyal;
with the blameless man You show Yourself blameless;
27 With the pure You show Yourself pure,
but with the crooked You show Yourself astute.
28 You save a humble people,
but Your eyes are on the haughty to bring them down.
29 For You are my lamp, O LORD,
and the LORD illumines my darkness.
30 For by You I run against a troop,
and by my God I leap over a wall.
31 This God—His way is perfect;
the word of the LORD is proven;
He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
32 For who is God but the LORD?
And who is a rock except our God?
33 God is my strong fortress,
and He makes my way blameless.
34 He makes my feet like the feet of a deer
and sets me on my high places.
35 He trains my hands for battle,
so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
36 You have given me the shield of Your salvation,
and Your gentleness has made me great.
37 You enlarged my steps under me,
and my feet did not slip.
38 I pursued my enemies and destroyed them,
and I did not turn back until they were consumed.
39 I consumed them and crushed them so that they could not rise;
they fell under my feet.
40 For You girded me with strength for battle;
You subdued under me those who rose up against me.
41 You made my enemies turn their backs to me—
those who hated me—and I destroyed them.
42 They looked, but there was no one to save,
to the LORD, but He did not answer them.
43 Then I pulverized them like the dust of the earth;
I crushed them and stamped them down like the mire of the streets.
44 You delivered me from the strivings of my people;
You preserved me as the head of the nations;
a people whom I had not known served me.
45 Foreigners came cringing to me;
as soon as they heard, they obeyed me.
46 Foreigners faded away
and came trembling out of their fortresses.
47 The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock,
and exalted be God, the rock of my salvation—
48 the God who gave me vengeance
and brought down peoples under me,
49 who brought me out from my enemies;
You exalted me above those who rose against me;
You delivered me from the violent man.
50 Therefore I will give thanks to You, O LORD,
among the nations and will sing praises to Your name.
51 He gives great salvation to His king
and shows steadfast love to His anointed,
to David and his seed forever.




Chapter 23


1 Now these are the last words of David:
David the son of Jesse declares,
the man raised on high declares,
the anointed of the God of Jacob,
and the sweet psalmist of Israel:
2 “The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me,
and His word was on my tongue.
3 The God of Israel has spoken;
the Rock of Israel has said to me:
‘He who rules justly over men,
ruling in the fear of God,
4 is like the light of morning when the sun rises,
a morning without clouds,
from the brightness after rain
that brings grass from the earth.’


5 Truly, my house is not so with God,
yet He has made with me an everlasting covenant,
ordered in all things and secure.
For will He not make it grow,
my entire salvation and all my desire?
6 But worthless men are all like thorns cast away,
for they cannot be taken with the hand;
7 but the man who touches them
arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear,
and they are utterly burned with fire in their place.”


8 These are the names of the mighty men whom David had:
Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains—
he wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time.
9 Next to him among the mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, son of an Ahohite.
He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle,
and the men of Israel withdrew.
10 He rose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary and clung to the sword,
and the LORD brought about a great victory that day. The people returned after him only to strip the slain.
11 Next to him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines gathered at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people fled from the Philistines.
12 But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it, and struck down the Philistines, and the LORD worked a great victory.
13 And three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David at harvest time to the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
14 David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
15 David longed and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!”
16 So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and carried it and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it; he poured it out to the LORD
17 and said, “Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.


18 Now Abishai the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the Thirty. He wielded his spear against three hundred and killed them and won a name beside the Three.
19 He was the most honored of the Thirty and became their commander, but he did not become one of the Three.


20 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and struck a lion in the midst of a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
21 He struck down an Egyptian, a man of great stature. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff, and he snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.
22 These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name beside the Three mighty men.
23 He was more honored than the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. And David set him over his guard.


24 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the Thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
25 Shammah of Harod, Elika of Harod,
26 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh of Tekoa,
27 Abiezer of Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
28 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai of Netophah,
29 Heleb the son of Baanah of Netophah, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjaminites,
30 Benaiah of Pirathon, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
31 Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth of Bahurim,
32 Eliahba of Shaalbon, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
33 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
34 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai of Maacah, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
35 Hezro of Carmel, Paarai the Arbite,
36 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
37 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai of Beeroth, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
38 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
39 Uriah the Hittite—thirty-seven in all.




Chapter 24


1 Again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He incited David against them, saying, “Go, count Israel and Judah.”
2 So the king said to Joab, the commander of the army who was with him, “Go throughout all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people, so that I may know the number of the people.”
3 But Joab said to the king, “May the LORD your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king still see it! But why does my lord the king delight in this thing?”
4 Yet the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel.


5 They crossed the Jordan and camped at Aroer, to the right of the town that is in the midst of the valley of Gad and toward Jazer.
6 Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi, and they came to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon.
7 They came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites, and they went out to the Negev of Judah at Beersheba.
8 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.


9 Joab gave the number of the count of the people to the king: there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand.
10 But David’s heart struck him after he had counted the people. And David said to the LORD, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O LORD, please take away the guilt of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”


11 When David rose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,
12 “Go and speak to David, ‘Thus says the LORD: I offer you three things; choose one of them, so that I may do it to you.’”
13 So Gad came to David and told him. He said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or shall you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days of pestilence in your land? Now consider and see what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.”
14 Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”


15 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning until the appointed time, and seventy thousand men from Dan to Beersheba died.
16 When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “It is enough; now withdraw your hand.” And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
17 Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was striking the people and said, “Behold, it is I who have sinned, and it is I who have done wrong. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let Your hand be against me and against my father’s house.”


18 Then Gad came to David that day and said to him, “Go up, raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”
19 So David went up, according to the word of Gad, as the LORD had commanded.
20 Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him, and Araunah went out and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
21 Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”
David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar to the LORD, so that the plague may be stopped from the people.”
22 Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what is good in his eyes. Look, the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.
23 All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “May the LORD your God accept you.”
24 But the king said to Araunah, “No, I will buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
25 David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And the LORD responded to the plea for the land, and the plague was stopped from Israel.﻿1 Kings


Chapter 1


1 Now King David was old and advanced in years, and though they covered him with blankets, he could not get warm.
2 So his servants said to him, “Let them seek for my lord the king a young virgin, and let her attend the king and care for him, and let her lie in your bosom, so that my lord the king may keep warm.”
3 So they searched for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and they found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king.
4 The young woman was very beautiful, and she attended the king and served him, but the king did not sleep with her.


5 Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him.
6 But his father had never contradicted him at any time by asking, “Why have you done so?” He was also very handsome, and he was the next oldest son after Absalom.
7 He conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they supported Adonijah.
8 But Zadok the priest and Benaiah son of Jehoiada and Nathan the prophet and Shimei and Rei and David’s mighty men were not with Adonijah.
9 And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fattened calves by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants.
10 But he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty men or Solomon his brother.


11 Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know it?
12 Now therefore come, let me give you advice so that you may save your life and the life of your son Solomon.
13 Go in to King David and say to him, ‘Did not you, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying, “Surely Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then has Adonijah become king?”’
14 Then, while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.”
15 So Bathsheba went in to the king in the inner room. The king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to the king.
16 Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king, and the king said, “What is your request?”
17 She said to him, “My lord, you swore by the LORD your God to your servant, ‘Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.’
18 But now, behold, Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know it.
19 He has sacrificed oxen and fattened calves and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but Solomon your servant he has not invited.
20 And you, my lord the king—the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
21 Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders.”


22 While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.
23 They told the king, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And he came in before the king and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.
24 And Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne’?
25 For today he has gone down and has sacrificed oxen and fattened calves and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons and the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest, and behold, they are eating and drinking before him and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’
26 But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest and Benaiah son of Jehoiada and Solomon your servant he has not invited.
27 Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king, and have you not told your servant who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”


28 Then King David answered, “Call Bathsheba to me.” And she came in before the king and stood before the king.
29 The king swore and said, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of every trouble,
30 just as I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ I will make it happen this day.”
31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and did obeisance to the king and said, “May my lord King David live forever!”
32 Then King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” And they came before the king.
33 And the king said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.
34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Then blow the trumpet and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’
35 Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, for he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.”


36 Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, “Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, say so too.
37 As the LORD has been with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon, and may He make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.”
38 So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and they brought him to Gihon.
39 Then Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!”
40 And all the people went up after him, playing flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth was split by their sound.
41 Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had finished eating. And Joab heard the sound of the trumpet and said, “Why is the city making such an uproar?”
42 While he was still speaking, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came, and Adonijah said, “Come in, for you are a valiant man and bring good news.”
43 But Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, “No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king.
44 The king has sent with him Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride on the king’s mule.
45 Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the sound that you have heard.
46 Moreover, Solomon sits on the royal throne.
47 Also the king’s servants came to bless our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and his throne greater than your throne,’ and the king bowed himself on the bed.
48 And the king also said, ‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has granted one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.’”


49 Then all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and they rose and went each his own way.
50 And Adonijah feared Solomon, and he arose and went and took hold of the horns of the altar.
51 And it was told Solomon, saying, “Behold, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, for he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’”
52 Solomon said, “If he is a worthy man, not one of his hairs shall fall to the ground, but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.”
53 So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed to King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”




Chapter 2


1 When the time drew near for David to die, he commanded Solomon his son, saying,
2 “I am going the way of all the earth. Be strong, and show yourself a man.
3 Keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His ordinances, and His testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, so that you may succeed in all that you do and wherever you turn,
4 and so that the LORD may establish His word which He spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your sons are careful in their way, to walk before Me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’
5 Moreover, you know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel—to Abner son of Ner and to Amasa son of Jether—whom he killed, shedding the blood of war in peace and putting the blood of war on his belt that was around his waist and on the sandals that were on his feet.
6 Do therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.
7 But deal loyally with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, for they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.
8 And as you see, Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, is with you. He cursed me with a grievous curse on the day I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with the sword.’
9 Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down with blood to the grave.”


10 Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.
11 The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.


12 So Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.
13 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, “Do you come in peace?” He said, “Yes, in Peace.”
14 Then he said, “I have a request to ask of you.” And she said, “Speak.”
15 He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel expected me to reign. However, the kingdom has turned and become my brother’s, as was the will of the LORD.
16 Now I ask one request of you; do not refuse me.” And she said to him, “Speak.”
17 Then he said, “Please speak to Solomon the king, for he will not refuse you, to give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife.”
18 Bathsheba said, “Very well; I will speak for you to the king.”
19 So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her and bowed to her. Then he sat on his throne and had a seat brought for the king’s mother, and she sat at his right hand.
20 Then she said, “I ask one small request of you; do not refuse me.” And the king said to her, “Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse you.”
21 She said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah, your brother, as a wife.”
22 King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also—for he is my older brother—yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and for Joab son of Zeruiah!”
23 Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, “May God do so to me and more also if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life!
24 Now therefore as the LORD lives, who has established me and set me on the throne of David my father and who has made me a house as He promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today.”
25 So King Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck him down, and he died.


26 To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your estate, for you deserve death, but I will not put you to death at this time because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and because you shared in all the affliction my father suffered.”
27 So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, thus fulfilling the word of the LORD that He had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.


28 When the news came to Joab—for Joab had supported Adonijah, though he had not supported Absalom—Joab fled to the tent of the LORD and caught hold of the horns of the altar.
29 It was told King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Solomon sent Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down.”
30 So Benaiah came to the tent of the LORD and said to him, “The king commands, ‘Come out.’” But he said, “No, I will die here.” Then Benaiah reported back to the king, saying, “This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me.”
31 The king said to him, “Do as he has said. Strike him down and bury him, and thus remove from me and from my father's house the guilt of the blood that Joab shed without cause.
32 The LORD will return his blood upon his own head, because he struck down two men more righteous and better than himself, and killed them with the sword—Abner son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah—though my father David had no part in it.
33 So their blood shall return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his descendants forever. But for David and his descendants and his house and his throne, there shall be peace from the LORD forever.”
34 Then Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and killed him, and he was buried at his house in the wilderness.


35 The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in his place, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.
36 Then the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, and do not go out from there to any place whatever.
37 For on the day you go out and cross the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall surely die; your blood shall be on your own head.”
38 Shimei said to the king, “The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for many days.
39 But it came about at the end of three years that two of Shimei’s servants ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, “Behold, your servants are in Gath.”
40 Then Shimei arose and saddled his donkey and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.
41 It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned.
42 The king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the LORD and solemnly warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on the day you go out and go to any place whatever, you shall surely die’? And you said to me, ‘The saying is good; I have heard.’
43 Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD and the commandment that I charged you with?”
44 The king said also to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the evil that you did to David my father. Therefore the LORD will return your evil onto your own head.
45 But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever.”
46 So the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck him down, and he died.
And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.




Chapter 3


1 Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh’s daughter and brought her into the city of David until he had finished building his own house, the house of the LORD, and the wall around Jerusalem.
2 However, the people were sacrificing at the high places, because no house had yet been built for the name of the LORD.
3 Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father, but he also sacrificed and burned incense at the high places.
4 The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
5 At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night. And God said, “Ask what I shall give you.”
6 Solomon said, “You have shown great loyal love to Your servant David my father, because he walked before You in truth and righteousness and in uprightness of heart toward You. And You have kept for him this great loyal love and have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
7 Now, O LORD my God, You have made Your servant king in place of David my father, though I am but a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.
8 And Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen, a great people, too many to be numbered or counted.
9 Give Your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil—for who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”


10 It was pleasing in the eyes of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing.
11 And God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to hear judgment,
12 behold, I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and understanding heart, so that none like you has been before you, and none like you shall arise after you.
13 I also give you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no king shall compare with you all your days.
14 And if you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and My commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”
15 Then Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.


16 Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
17 And the one woman said, “O my lord, this woman and I dwell in the same house, and I gave birth while she was in the house.
18 On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. We were together; there was no one else with us in the house—only the two of us were in the house.
19 Then this woman's son died in the night, because she lay on him.
20 And she rose at midnight and took my son from beside me while your servant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead son in my bosom.
21 When I rose in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead. But when I looked at him closely in the morning, behold, he was not the son whom I bore.”
22 Then the other woman said, “No! The living child is mine, and the dead one is your son.” But the first said, “No! The dead child is yours, and the living one is mine.” Thus they spoke before the king.
23 Then the king said, “The one says, ‘This is my son who lives, and your son is dead,’ and the other says, ‘No, but your son is dead, and my son is the living one.’”
24 And the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king.
25 And the king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.”
26 Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king—because her heart yearned for her son—she said, “Please, my lord, give her the living child, and do not kill him.” But the other said, “He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him.”
27 Then the king answered and said, “Give her the living child, and do not kill him; she is his mother.”
28 And all Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered, and they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.




Chapter 4


1 King Solomon was king over all Israel.
2 These were his officials: Azariah son of Zadok was the priest.
3 Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha, were secretaries; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder.
4 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
5 Azariah son of Nathan was over the officers; Zabud son of Nathan, a priest, was the king’s friend;
6 Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram son of Abda was over the forced labor.


7 Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household. Each one had to provide food for a month in the year.
8 These were their names: Ben-Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
9 Ben-Deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;
10 Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth—to him belonged Socoh and all the land of Hepher;
11 Ben-Abinadab, in all Naphath-dor (he had Taphath, the daughter of Solomon, as wife);
12 Baana son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
13 Ben-Geber, in Ramoth-gilead (to him belonged the villages of Jair son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, and he had the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);
14 Ahinadab son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
15 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath, the daughter of Solomon, as wife);
16 Baana son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
17 Jehoshaphat son of Paruah, in Issachar;
18 Shimei son of Ela, in Benjamin;
19 Geber son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the land of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan—he was the only officer in that region.


20 Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand that is by the sea in multitude. They ate and drank and were joyful.
21 Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.


22 Solomon's provision for one day was thirty kors of fine flour, sixty kors of meal,
23 ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, a hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl.
24 For he had dominion over all the region west of the River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River. And he had peace on all sides around him.
25 Judah and Israel lived in safety, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.


26 Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
27 Those officers provided food for King Solomon and for all who came to King Solomon’s table, each in his month. They left nothing lacking.
28 Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds they brought to the place where it was needed, each according to his duty.
29 God gave Solomon wisdom and very great understanding and breadth of mind like the sand that is on the seashore.
30 Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt.
31 For he was wiser than all men, wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol, and his fame was in all the surrounding nations.
32 He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were a thousand and five.
33 He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He also spoke of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish.
34 And men came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.




Chapter 5


1 Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father, for Hiram had always loved David.
2 Solomon sent word to Hiram, saying,
3 “You know that David my father was not able to build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the wars which surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
4 But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune.
5 So I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, just as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build the house for My name.’
6 Now therefore, command that they cut down cedars for me from Lebanon, and my servants will be with your servants, and I will give you wages for your servants, according to all that you say. For you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”


7 When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the LORD this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.”
8 So Hiram sent word to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message that you sent to me. I will do all your desire concerning the cedar and cypress timber.
9 My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you indicate to me. I will break them up there, and you shall carry them away. Then you shall accomplish my desire by giving food for my household.”


10 So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and cypress timber that he desired.
11 Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.
12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, just as He had promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a covenant.


13 King Solomon raised a forced labor levy out of all Israel, and the levy numbered thirty thousand men.
14 He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts. They were a month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was over the forced labor.
15 Solomon had seventy thousand burden bearers and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the hill country,
16 besides Solomon’s chief officers who were over the work, three thousand three hundred, who ruled over the people who were doing the work.
17 At the king’s command they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stone.
18 So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the men of Gebal cut them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.




Chapter 6


1 In the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv (which is the second month), he began to build the house of the LORD.


2 The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits in length, twenty cubits in width, and thirty cubits in height.
3 The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, corresponding to the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house.
4 He made windows with recessed frames for the house.


5 He built a structure against the wall of the house, enclosing the walls of the house around the nave and the inner sanctuary; he made side chambers all around.
6 The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for he made offset ledges around the outside of the house, so that the beams would not be inserted into the walls of the house.


7 When the house was being built, it was constructed with finished stones cut at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe nor any iron tool was heard in the house while it was being built.


8 The entrance for the lowest story of the side chambers was on the south side of the house, and one went up by winding stairs to the middle story, and from the middle to the third.
9 So he built the house and completed it, and he roofed the house with beams and planks of cedar.
10 He built the side chambers against the entire house, each five cubits high, and they were fastened to the house with cedar timbers.


11 Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
12 “Concerning this house which you are building, if you walk in My statutes and execute My ordinances and keep all My commandments by walking in them, then I will establish My word with you, which I spoke to your father David.
13 I will dwell among the sons of Israel and will not forsake My people Israel.”


14 So Solomon built the house and completed it.


15 He lined the walls of the house on the inside with cedar boards; from the floor of the house to the ceiling he covered them with wood on the inside. He overlaid the floor of the house with planks of cypress.
16 He built twenty cubits from the rear of the house with cedar boards from the floor to the ceiling, and he built it within as an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.
17 The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long.
18 The cedar within the house was carved in the form of gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was seen.


19 He prepared the inner sanctuary in the innermost part of the house, to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there.
20 The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the altar with cedar.
21 Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across the front of the inner sanctuary, and he overlaid it with gold.
22 He overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. He also overlaid the entire altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary with gold.


23 In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high.
24 One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub was five cubits; from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other was ten cubits.
25 The other cherub also was ten cubits; both cherubim were of the same measure and the same form.
26 The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was the other cherub.
27 He set the cherubim within the inner house, and the wings of the cherubim were spread out, so that the wing of one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the house.
28 He overlaid the cherubim with gold.


29 He carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, in both the inner and outer rooms.
30 He overlaid the floor of the house with gold, in both the inner and outer rooms.


31 For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and doorposts formed a fifth of the wall.
32 He carved on them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and he spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.


33 So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, forming a fourth of the wall,
34 and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
35 He carved on them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work.


36 He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and one course of cedar beams.


37 In the fourth year, in the month of Ziv, the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid,
38 and in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul (which is the eighth month), the house was finished in all its parts and according to all its specifications. It took him seven years to build it.




Chapter 7


1 But Solomon was building his own house for thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
2 He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon: one hundred cubits in length, fifty cubits in width, and thirty cubits in height, on four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars.
3 And it was roofed with cedar above the chambers that were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.
4 There were three rows of window frames, and window was opposite window in three tiers.
5 And all the doorways and posts had square frames, and window was opposite window in three tiers.
6 And he made the Hall of Pillars, fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide, with a porch in front, and pillars and a threshold in front of them.
7 And he made the Hall of the Throne where he would judge—the Hall of Judgment—and it was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling.
8 And his house where he would dwell, in the other court behind the hall, was of like workmanship. He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Solomon had taken as a wife.


9 All these were made with costly stones, cut according to measure, sawed with saws inside and outside, from the foundation to the coping, and from the outside to the great court.
10 And the foundation was laid with costly stones, large stones—stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.
11 And above were costly stones, cut according to measure, and cedar wood.
12 And the great court all around was with three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams, just like the inner court of the house of the LORD and the porch of the house.


13 And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre.
14 He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze. And he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill to work all kinds of work in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and did all his work.
15 And he cast two pillars of bronze; eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits encircled the second pillar.
16 And he made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
17 There were lattices of checkerwork, wreaths of chainwork, for the capitals on the tops of the pillars—seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital.
18 And he made the pillars with two rows of pomegranates all around on the one latticework to cover the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the same he did for the other capital.
19 Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the porch were of lily design, four cubits high.
20 And the capitals on the two pillars were also above, close by the bulge that was beside the latticework. And there were two hundred pomegranates in rows all around the one capital, and so also on the other capital.
21 And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple. He set up the right pillar and called its name Jachin, and he set up the left pillar and called its name Boaz.
22 And on the tops of the pillars was lily design. So the work of the pillars was finished.
23 And he made the sea of cast metal, ten cubits from brim to brim, round in shape, and five cubits in height. A line of thirty cubits encircled it all around.
24 And under its brim were gourds encircling it, ten to a cubit, encircling the sea all around. The gourds were cast in two rows when it was cast.
25 It stood on twelve oxen: three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their hindquarters were inward.
26 And it was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.
27 And he made the ten stands of bronze: each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.


28 And this was the design of the stands: they had panels, and the panels were set in frames.
29 And on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim, and there was a pedastal above upon the frames. And beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.
30 And each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles. And the four feet of the stand had supports; under the basin were cast supports on each side, with wreaths.
31 Its opening inside the crown at the top was a cubit in diameter, and the opening was round, made like a pedestal, a cubit and a half in height. Also on the opening were engravings, and their panels were square, not round.
32 And the four wheels were underneath the panels, and the axles of the wheels were joined to the stand. The height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.
33 The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel. Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.
34 And there were four supports at the four corners of each stand. The supports were of one piece with the stand itself.
35 And at the top of the stand was a round band half a cubit high. And at the top of the stand, its stays and its panels were of one piece with it.
36 And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.


37 This is how he made the ten stands: all of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.
38 And he made ten basins of bronze—each basin held forty baths and measured four cubits—each basin was set on one of the ten stands.
39 And he set the stands, five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house. And he set the sea on the right side of the house to the southeast.
40 And Hiram made the basins, the shovels, and the bowls. So Hiram finished doing all the work he did for King Solomon on the house of the LORD:
41 the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on top of the two pillars, the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,
42 the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks—two rows of pomegranates for each latticework to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars,
43 the ten stands and the ten basins on the stands,
44 the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea,
45 the pots, the shovels, and the bowls. All these utensils that Hiram made for King Solomon for the house of the LORD were of polished bronze.


46 The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
47 And Solomon left all the utensils unweighed because there were so many—the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.
48 And Solomon made all the furnishings that were in the house of the LORD: the golden altar, the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence,
49 the lampstands of pure gold—five on the right side and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary—with the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold,
50 the cups, the snuffers, the bowls, the ladles, and the firepans of pure gold, and the sockets for the doors of the inner house, the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the nave of the house, of gold.
51 And all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and the vessels—and put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.




Chapter 8


1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chiefs of the fathers’ houses of the sons of Israel, to King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
2 And all the men of Israel assembled to King Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent—the priests and the Levites brought them up.


5 And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.
6 Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the Most Holy Place, under the wings of the cherubim.
7 For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above.
8 And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before the inner sanctuary, but they were not seen outside. And they are there to this day.
9 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the sons of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt.


10 And it came to pass when the priests came out of the Holy Place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,
11 so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.


12 Then Solomon said, “The LORD has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.
13 I have indeed built you a lofty house, a place for you to dwell in forever.”


14 Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.
15 And he said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has fulfilled it with his hand, saying,
16 ‘Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city from all the tribes of Israel to build a house that my name might be there. But I chose David to be over my people Israel.’
17 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
18 But the LORD said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart.
19 Nevertheless, you shall not build the house, but your son who shall come from your body—he shall build the house for my name.’
20 So the LORD has established his word that he spoke, and I have risen in place of David my father and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and I have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
21 And I have set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.”


22 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.
23 And he said, “O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and steadfast love with your servants who walk before you with all their heart,
24 who have kept with your servant David my father what you declared to him. Indeed, you spoke with your mouth, and with your hand have fulfilled it this day.
25 Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you promised him, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons take heed to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.’
26 Now therefore, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed that you spoke to your servant David my father.
27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens—even the highest heaven—cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built!
28 Yet turn toward the prayer of your servant and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you today,
29 that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which you have said, ‘My name shall be there,’ to listen to the prayer that your servant shall pray toward this place.
30 And listen to the plea of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.
31 If a man sins against his neighbor and he is required to take an oath, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house,
32 then hear in heaven and act and judge your servants, condemning the wicked by bringing his way on his own head, and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness.
33 When your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against you, and they turn back to you and confess your name and pray and make supplication to you in this house,
34 then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land that you gave to their fathers.
35 When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, and they pray toward this place and confess your name and turn from their sin because you afflict them,
36 then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and give rain upon your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
37 If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, blight, mildew, locust, or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in the land at their gates—whatever plague, whatever sickness there is;
38 whatever prayer or supplication is made by any man or by all your people Israel, each knowing the affliction of his own heart and spreading out his hands toward this house,
39 then hear in heaven your dwelling place and forgive and act and give to each man according to all his ways, whose heart you know—for you alone know the hearts of all the sons of men—
40 that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our fathers.
41 Moreover, concerning a foreigner who is not of your people Israel, but comes from a distant land for the sake of your name—
42 for they shall hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm—when he comes and prays toward this house,
43 hear in heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to you, that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house that I have built is called by your name.
44 When your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you send them, and they pray to the LORD toward the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,
45 then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
46 If they sin against you—for there is no man who does not sin—and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near,
47 yet if they take it to heart in the land where they are carried captive and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned and acted perversely and wickedly,’
48 and if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive, and pray to you toward their land that you gave to their fathers, the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built for your name,
49 then hear in heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause,
50 and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions that they have committed against you, and grant them compassion before those who took them captive, that they may have compassion on them.
51 For they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace.
52 Let your eyes be open to the supplication of your servant and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they call to you.
53 For you set them apart as your inheritance from all the peoples of the earth, as you spoke through Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.”


54 And it came to pass when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread out toward heaven.
55 And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
56 “Blessed be the LORD who has given rest to his people Israel according to all that he promised. Not one word has failed of all his good promise, which he spoke by the hand of Moses his servant.
57 May the LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers. Let him not leave us or forsake us,
58 that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers.
59 And let these words of mine, with which I have pleaded before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel as each day requires,
60 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is no other.
61 Let your heart therefore be wholly devoted to the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments, as on this day.”


62 Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before the LORD.
63 And Solomon offered as peace offerings to the LORD twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the sons of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.


64 That same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too small to receive the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat of the peace offerings.
65 So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven more days—fourteen days.
66 On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shown to David his servant and to Israel his people.




Chapter 9


1 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the king’s house and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,
2 that the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
3 And the LORD said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you made before me. I have consecrated this house that you have built, to put my name there forever, and my eyes and my heart shall be there all the days.
4 And as for you, if you walk before me as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and keep my statutes and my ordinances,
5 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’
6 But if you or your sons indeed turn away from following me, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and bow down to them,
7 then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them, and this house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight, and Israel shall become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
8 And this house shall become a heap of stones; everyone who passes by it shall be appalled and hiss and say, ‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?’
9 And they will say, ‘Because they abandoned the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods and bowed down to them and served them. Therefore the LORD brought all this evil upon them.’”


10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king’s house—
11 Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold, according to all his desire—then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, but they did not please him.
13 And he said, “What kind of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?” And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.
14 And Hiram had sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold.


15 And this is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon levied, to build the house of the LORD and his own house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer.
16 (Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.)
17 And Solomon built Gezer and Lower Beth-horon,
18 and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness in the land,
19 and all the store cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and what Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion.


20 All the people who were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel—
21 their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel were not able to devote to destruction—Solomon made them slaves for forced labor to this day.
22 But of the sons of Israel, Solomon made no slaves; they were the men of war and his servants and his princes and his captains and commanders of his chariots and his horsemen.


23 These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work, five hundred fifty, who ruled over the people who did the work.


24 But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David to her house that Solomon had built for her. Then he built the Millo.
25 And three times in the year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar that he built to the LORD, burning incense with them before the LORD. So he completed the house.


26 And King Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom.
27 And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
28 And they went to Ophir and took from there four hundred twenty talents of gold, and brought it to King Solomon.




Chapter 10


1 Now the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, and she came to test him with hard questions.
2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices and large quantities of gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart.
3 And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king that he did not explain to her.
4 And when the Queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,
5 the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers and their apparel, his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her.


6 And she said to the king, “The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom.
7 But I did not believe the reports until I came and saw it with my own eyes. And yet, the half was not told me; your wisdom and prosperity exceed the report that I heard.
8 How happy your men are! Happy are your servants who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
9 Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the LORD loves Israel forever, he has made you king, that you may execute justice and righteousness.”


10 Then she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones. Never again such abundance of spices as these came to Israel that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.


11 And the fleet of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir also brought from Ophir a great quantity of almug wood and precious stones.
12 And the king made from the almug wood supports for the house of the LORD and for the king’s house, also lyres and harps for the singers. No such almug wood has come or been seen to this day.


13 And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, besides what was given her by the hand of King Solomon. Then she returned and went back to her own land, she and her servants.


14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,
15 besides what came from the traders and the traffic of the merchants, and from all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land.


16 And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.
17 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
18 And the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the finest gold.
19 The throne had six steps, and the throne had a rounded top at the back, and armrests on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests,
20 and twelve lions were standing there on the six steps, one on each side of the step. Nothing like it had been made for any kingdom.
21 All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver—it was not considered of any value in the days of Solomon.
22 For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of Tarshish came, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.


23 So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
24 And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
25 And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, a set amount year by year.
26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
27 And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as plentiful as the sycamore trees that are in the Shephelah.
28 And Solomon imported horses from Egypt and from Kue, and the king’s merchants received them from Kue for a price.
29 And a chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; and so they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram by their hand.




Chapter 11


1 Now King Solomon loved many foreign women, besides the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women,
2 from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the sons of Israel, “You shall not go among them, and they shall not come among you, for surely they will turn your heart after their gods.” But Solomon clung to them in love.
3 He had seven hundred wives, all princesses, and three hundred concubines, and his wives turned his heart away from God.
4 For when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not wholly devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been.


5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
6 And Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and did not fully follow the LORD as David his father had done.
7 Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab on the mountain which is east of Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the sons of Ammon.
8 And thus he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.


9 Now the LORD was angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice
10 and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not obey what the LORD had commanded.
11 Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, “Since this has been your practice and you have not kept My covenant and My statutes which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and give it to your servant.
12 However, I will not do it in your days, for the sake of David your father. Rather, I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
13 Yet I will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of David My servant and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.”


14 Then the LORD raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He was of the royal line in Edom.
15 For it came to pass when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, that he had struck down every male in Edom—
16 for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom—
17 but Hadad fled to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, Hadad being yet a little child.
18 They set out from Midian and came to Paran, and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him food and gave him land.
19 And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he allowed him to marry the sister of his own wife—the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
20 And the sister of Tahpenes bore to him Genubath, his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh.
21 But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.”
22 Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me, that you now seek to go to your own country?” And he said, “Let me go, please.”


23 God also raised up another adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah.
24 He gathered men to himself and became leader of a band when David killed the Syrians. And they went to Damascus and dwelt there and reigned in Damascus.
25 He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, along with the evil that Hadad did. And he loathed Israel and reigned over Aram.


26 Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king.
27 And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built the Millo and closed up the breach of the city of David, his father.
28 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor, and Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, so he appointed him over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.


29 At that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had clothed himself with a new garment, and the two of them were alone in the field.
30 Then Ahijah took hold of the new garment that was on him and tore it into twelve pieces.
31 And he said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself. For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Look, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and will give you ten tribes.
32 But he shall have one tribe for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel—
33 because they have forsaken Me and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and they have not walked in My ways, to do what is right in My eyes and to keep My statutes and My judgments, as David his father did.
34 Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David My servant whom I chose, who kept My commandments and My statutes.
35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand and give it to you, ten tribes.
36 And to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put My name.
37 And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.
38 And if you will listen to all that I command you and walk in My ways and do what is right in My sight by keeping My statutes and My commandments, as David My servant did, then I will be with you and build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.
39 And I will afflict the offspring of David because of this—but not forever.’”


40 Because of this, Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to live with Shishak, king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until Solomon’s death.


41 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
42 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
43 And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 12


1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
2 And when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it—for he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon—Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
3 And they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam,
4 “Your father made our yoke heavy. Now, therefore, lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he placed on us, and we will serve you.”
5 So he said to them, “Depart for three days, then return to me.” And the people departed.


6 Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had stood before Solomon, his father, while he was alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?”
7 And they spoke to him, saying, “If today you will be a servant to this people and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever.”
8 But he abandoned the counsel that the elders had given him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.
9 And he said to them, “What do you advise, that we should answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father placed on us’?”
10 And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus shall you say to this people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us’—thus shall you say to them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.
11 And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”


12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had directed, saying, “Return to me on the third day.”
13 And the king answered the people harshly, and he forsook the counsel that the elders had given him.
14 And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”
15 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, that He might establish His word which the LORD spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.


16 And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying,
“What portion do we have in David?
We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.
To your tents, O Israel!
Now look to your own house, David.”
So Israel went to their tents.
17 But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
18 And when King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the forced labor, all Israel stoned him to death with stones. Then King Rehoboam had to hurry to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
19 Thus Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.


20 And then, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. No one followed the house of David, except only the tribe of Judah.
21 And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
22 But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
23 “Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,
24 ‘Thus says the LORD, “You shall not go up or fight against your brothers, the sons of Israel. Everyone, return to your houses, for this happened because of Me.”’” So they listened to the word of the LORD and went home, according to the word of the LORD.


25 Then Jeroboam built up Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. And he went out from there and built up Penuel.
26 Then Jeroboam thought to himself, “Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.
27 If this people goes up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will return to their lord, to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”
28 So the king took counsel and made two calves of gold. And he said to the people, “You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”
29 And he set up one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.
30 And this thing became a sin, for the people went as far as Dan to worship before them.
31 He also made temples on high places and appointed priests from among any of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
32 And Jeroboam instituted a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar. So he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.
33 Then he went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month that he had devised in his own heart. And he instituted a feast for the sons of Israel and went up to the altar to make offerings.




Chapter 13


1 And behold, a man of God came from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD, while Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer incense.
2 And he cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD and said, “O altar, altar! Thus says the LORD: Look! A son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice upon you the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and men’s bones shall be burned on you.’”
3 And he gave a sign that same day, saying, “This is the sign that the LORD has spoken: the altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.”


4 And it came to pass, when the king heard the word of the man of God, which he cried out against the altar at Bethel, that Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” And his hand, which he stretched out against him, withered, so that he could not draw it back to himself.
5 The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
6 Then the king said to the man of God, “Entreat now the favor of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.” And the man of God prayed to LORD, and the king’s hand was restored to him and became as it was before.
7 And the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.”
8 But the man of God said to the king, “If you were to give me half your house, I would not go in with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place.
9 For so it was commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way that you came.’”
10 So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.


11 Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the deeds that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the words that he had spoken to the king.
12 And their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” Now his sons had seen the way the man of God who came from Judah had gone.
13 And he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it.
14 And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” And he said, “I am.”
15 Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.”
16 But he said, “I may not return with you or go in with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.
17 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, ‘You shall eat no bread and drink no water there, and do not return by the way that you came.’”
18 And he said to him, “I also am a prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘Bring him back with you into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.’” But he lied to him.
19 So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.


20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back.
21 And he cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, saying, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have disobeyed the mouth of the LORD and have not kept the command that the LORD your God commanded you,
22 but came back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which He said to you, “Eat no bread and drink no water,” your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.’”
23 And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.
24 And as he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was thrown in the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body.
25 And it happened that men passed by and saw the body thrown in the road, and the lion standing beside the body. And they came and told about it in the city where the old prophet lived.


26 And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the LORD; therefore the LORD has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word that the LORD spoke to him.”
27 And he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” And they saddled it.
28 And he went and found his body thrown in the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or torn the donkey.
29 And the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back, and he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn and to bury him.
30 And he laid the body in his own grave, and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”
31 And after he had buried him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
32 For the saying that he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria shall surely come to pass.”


33 After this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but again he made priests of the high places from among all the people. Anyone who desired it, he consecrated, and he became one of the priests of the high places.
34 And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as to cut it off and destroy it from the face of the earth.




Chapter 14


1 At that time Abijah, the son of Jeroboam, became sick.
2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, “Arise, and disguise yourself, so that you will not be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there, who spoke concerning me that I would be king over this people.
3 Take with you ten loaves, cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.”
4 And Jeroboam’s wife did so. She arose and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age.


5 And the LORD said to Ahijah, “Know that the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son, for he is sick. You shall say thus and thus to her, for it will be when she comes in that she will pretend to be another woman.”
6 And it came to pass, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another? For I am charged with hard news for you.
7 Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Because I exalted you from among the people and made you ruler over My people Israel,
8 and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you—and yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart, to do only that which was right in My eyes—
9 but you have done more evil than all who were before you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods and metal images, to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back—
10 therefore, I am bringing disaster upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male, both bond and free in Israel, and will burn up the house of Jeroboam as a man burns up dung until it is gone.
11 Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone who dies in the field the birds of the heavens shall eat, for the LORD has spoken it.’”


12 “Arise therefore, go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.
13 And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he alone of Jeroboam’s family shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something pleasing to the LORD, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.
14 Moreover, the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam this day—and now even!
15 And the LORD will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave to their fathers and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking the LORD to anger.
16 And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he sinned and made Israel to sin.”


17 Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah. And as she was entering the threshold of the house, the child died.
18 And they buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the prophet.


19 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought and how he reigned, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
20 And the days that Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years, and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place.


21 Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite.
22 And Judah did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done.
23 For they also built for themselves high places and pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree,
24 and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the sons of Israel.


25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem.
26 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house. He took everything. He also took away all the shields of gold that Solomon had made.
27 And King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.
28 And whenever the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard carried them and then brought them back to the guardroom.


29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. And Abijam his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 15


1 Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah.
2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
3 And he walked in all the sins of his father which he had committed before him, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as was the heart of his father David.
4 Nevertheless, for David’s sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to raise up his son after him and to establish Jerusalem,
5 because David did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and did not turn aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.


6 Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
7 And the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
8 And Abijam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Asa his son reigned in his place.


9 In the twentieth year of Jeroboam, king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah.
10 And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
11 And Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as David his father had done.
12 He put away the male cult prostitutes from the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
13 He also removed Maacah, his mother, from being queen mother, because she had made an abominable image for Asherah. And Asa cut down her image and burned it at the brook Kidron.
14 But the high places were not removed. Nevertheless, Asa’s heart was fully devoted to the LORD all his days.
15 And he brought into the house of the LORD the sacred gifts of his father and his own sacred gifts—silver and gold and vessels.


16 Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah, to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah.
18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that was left in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the treasuries of the king’s house and gave them into the hands of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,
19 “Let there be a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. I am sending you a present of silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, so that he may withdraw from me.”
20 So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. And he struck Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
21 And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah and remained in Tirzah.
22 Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah—none was exempt—and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.


23 Now the rest of all the acts of Asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet.
24 And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of David his father, and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.


25 Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.
26 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in his sin which he caused Israel to commit.
27 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines—for Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon—
28 and Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his place.
29 And as soon as he became king, he struck down all the house of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone who breathed, but he destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD that He spoke by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,
30 because of the sins of Jeroboam that he committed and that he made Israel to sin, and because of the anger to which he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel.


31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.


33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel at Tirzah, and he reigned twenty-four years.
34 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he caused Israel to commit.




Chapter 16


1 And the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
2 “Because I raised you up out of the dust and made you leader over My people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have caused My people Israel to sin, provoking Me to anger with their sins,
3 therefore, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
4 Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone who dies in the field the birds of the heavens shall eat.”


5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
6 And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried at Tirzah, and Elah his son reigned in his place.
7 Moreover, the word of the LORD came by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and also because he struck it down.


8 In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned two years.
9 But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. While he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah,
10 Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.


11 And when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, he struck down all the house of Baasha. He did not leave him a single male, either of his relatives or of his friends.
12 Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD that He spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
13 for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they committed, and which they caused Israel to sin, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger with their idols.
14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?


15 In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
16 And the troops who were encamped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired, and he has also struck down the king.” Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
17 So Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
18 And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house over him with fire and died,
19 because of his sins that he committed, doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and for the sin that he committed, making Israel to sin.
20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and the conspiracy that he made, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?


21 Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts. Half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.
22 But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died, and Omri became king.
23 In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, and he reigned twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirzah.
24 He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, and he built on the hill and called the name of the city that he built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.


25 Omri did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did more evil than all who were before him.
26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in the sins that he made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their idols.
27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri that he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
28 And Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and Ahab his son reigned in his place.


29 In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel. And Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
30 And Ahab the son of Omri did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him.
31 And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took as his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal and worshiped him.
32 He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria.
33 And Ahab made an Asherah. Ahab did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.


34 In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho. He laid its foundation at the cost of Abiram his firstborn and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.




Chapter 17


1 And Elijah the Tishbite, of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word.”


2 And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
3 “Depart from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.
4 And it shall be that you shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to provide for you there.”
5 So he went and did according to the word of the LORD. He went and lived by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.
6 And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.
7 And after some time the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.


8 Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
9 “Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.”
10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, “Please bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.”
11 And as she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand.”
12 And she said, “As the LORD your God lives, I have nothing baked—only a handful of flour in the jar and a little oil in the jug. And now I am gathering a couple of sticks, that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it and die.”
13 And Elijah said to her, “Do not fear. Go and do as you have said. But first make me a little cake from it and bring it to me, and afterward make some for yourself and your son.
14 For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘The jar of flour shall not be used up, and the jug of oil shall not run dry, until the day the LORD sends rain on the earth.’”
15 So she went and did as Elijah said. And she and he and her household ate for many days.
16 The jar of flour was not used up, nor did the jug of oil run dry, according to the word of the LORD that He spoke by Elijah.


17 And after these things the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill. And his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.
18 And she said to Elijah, “What have I to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to put my son to death?”
19 And he said to her, “Give me your son.” And he took him from her arms and carried him up into the upper chamber where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed.
20 And he cried to the LORD and said, “O LORD my God, have You brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by killing her son?”
21 Then he stretched himself out upon the child three times and cried to the LORD and said, “O LORD my God, let this child’s life come into him again.”
22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah, and the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.
23 And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house and gave him to his mother. And Elijah said, “See, your son lives.”


24 Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.”




Chapter 18


1 After many days the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, “Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the land.”
2 So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria.


3 And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly.
4 For when Jezebel was cutting off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and provided them with bread and water.)
5 And Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, and not lose all the animals.”
6 So they divided the land between them to pass through it. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.


7 And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. And he recognized him and fell on his face and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?”
8 And he answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here.’”
9 And he said, “What sin have I committed, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to put me to death?
10 As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. And when they said, ‘He is not here,’ he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they had not found you.
11 And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’
12 And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the LORD will carry you I know not where. And so when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me. But I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth.
13 Has it not been told to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD’s prophets by fifties in a cave and provided them with bread and water?
14 And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’ He will kill me.”
15 And Elijah said, “As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.”


16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.
17 When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is it you, you troubler of Israel?”
18 And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house have, because you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and have followed the Baals.
19 Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the four hundred fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel’s table.”


20 So Ahab sent to all the sons of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel.
21 And Elijah came near to all the people and said, “How long will you go limping between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, then follow him.” But the people did not answer him a word.
22 Then Elijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal’s prophets are four hundred fifty men.
23 Let two bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. And I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood and put no fire to it.
24 Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD, and the God who answers by fire—He is God.” And all the people answered and said, “It is well spoken.”


25 Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many, and call on the name of your god, but put no fire to it.”
26 And they took the bull that was given to them, and they prepared it and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped about the altar that they had made.
27 And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, “Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is meditating, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.”
28 And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them.
29 And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, but there was no voice. No one answered; no one paid attention.


30 Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been torn down.
31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, “Israel shall be your name.”
32 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. And he made a trench around the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed.
33 And he arranged the wood and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, “Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.”
34 And he said, “Do it a second time,” and they did it a second time. And he said, “Do it a third time,” and they did it a third time.
35 And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water.


36 And at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet came near and said, “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are the God in Israel, and that I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word.
37 Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that You, O LORD, are God, and that You have turned their hearts back.”
38 Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench.
39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, “The LORD, He is God! The LORD, He is God!”


40 And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.” And they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slaughtered them there.


41 And Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of the rushing of rain.”
42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel, and he bowed himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees.
43 And he said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” And he went up and looked and said, “There is nothing.” And he said, “Go again,” seven times.
44 And at the seventh time he said, “Behold, a little cloud like a man’s hand is rising from the sea.” And he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.’”
45 And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel.
46 And the hand of the LORD was upon Elijah, and he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.




Chapter 19


1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.”
3 Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.


4 But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he asked that he might die, saying, “It is enough now, O LORD; take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.”
5 And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And then, an angel touched him and said to him, “Arise and eat.”
6 And he looked, and saw that there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again.
7 And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, “Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.”
8 And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God.


9 And there he came to a cave and lodged in it. And then, the word of the LORD came to him, and He said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
10 He said, “I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.”
11 And He said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD.” And he watched as the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
12 And after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a still small voice.
13 And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
14 He said, “I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.”


15 And the LORD said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael as king over Syria.
16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint as king over Israel, and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place.
17 And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death.
18 Yet I have left seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.”


19 So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. And Elijah passed by him and threw his cloak upon him.
20 And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, “Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go back again, for what have I done to you?”
21 So he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and boiled their flesh with the yokes of the oxen and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and followed Elijah and served him.




Chapter 20


1 Now Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army together. Thirty-two kings were with him, along with horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria and fought against it.
2 And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, “Thus says Ben-hadad:
3 ‘Your silver and your gold are mine; your most beautiful wives and children are also mine.’”
4 And the king of Israel answered and said, “Just as you say, my lord the king, I and all that I have are yours.”
5 Then the messengers returned and said, “Thus says Ben-hadad: Though I have sent to you, saying, ‘You shall give me your silver and gold, your wives and your children,’
6 yet about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants. Whatever is desirable in your eyes, they shall take it in their hands and carry it away.”


7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, “Please notice and see how this man is seeking trouble. For he sent for my wives and my children, and for my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him.”
8 And all the elders and all the people said to him, “Do not listen and do not consent.”
9 So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you first demanded of your servant I will do, but this I cannot do.’” And the messengers departed and brought him word again.
10 Then Ben-hadad sent to him and said, “May the gods do so to me and more also if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.”
11 And the king of Israel answered and said, “Tell him, ‘Let not him who puts on his armor boast like one who takes it off.’”
12 And when Ben-hadad heard this message as he was drinking with the kings in the booths, he said to his servants, “Get ready.” And they got ready to attack the city.


13 And behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel and said, “Thus says the LORD: Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will give it into your hand this day, and you shall know that I am the LORD.”
14 And Ahab said, “By whom?” And he said, “Thus says the LORD: By the servants of the district governors.” Then he said, “Who shall begin the battle?” And he answered, “You.”
15 Then he mustered the servants of the district governors, and they were two hundred thirty-two. After them he mustered all the sons of Israel, seven thousand.


16 And they went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the thirty-two kings who helped him.
17 And the servants of the district governors went out first. And Ben-hadad sent out scouts, and they reported to him, saying, “Men have come out from Samaria.”
18 He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; and if they have come out for war, take them alive.”


19 So these went out of the city, the servants of the district governors and the army that followed them.
20 And each struck down his man. The Arameans fled, and Israel pursued them. But Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen.
21 And the king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots and struck down the Arameans with a great slaughter.


22 Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself and consider and see what you must do, for in the spring the king of Aram will come up against you.”
23 And the servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their god is a god of the mountains, so they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
24 And do this: remove the kings, each from his post, and put commanders in their places.
25 And muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot, and let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.” And he listened to their voice and did so.


26 In the spring Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
27 And the sons of Israel were mustered and provisioned and went against them. The sons of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the land.
28 And a man of God came near and said to the king of Israel, “Thus says the LORD: Because the Arameans have said, ‘The LORD is a god of the hills but He is not a god of the valleys,’ therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.”


29 And they encamped opposite each other seven days. On the seventh day the battle was joined, and the sons of Israel struck down of the Arameans one hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day.
30 And the rest fled into the city of Aphek, and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men who were left. And Ben-hadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber.


31 Then his servants said to him, “Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let us put sackcloth on our waists and ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life.”
32 So they girded sackcloth around their waists and put ropes on their heads and came to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’” And he said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”
33 Now the men were watching for a sign, and they quickly took it up from him and said, “Yes, your brother Ben-hadad.” Then he said, “Go, bring him.” Then Ben-hadad came out to him, and he had him come up into the chariot.
34 And Ben-hadad said to him, “The cities that my father took from your father I will restore, and you may make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.” And Ahab said, “I will let you go with this covenant.” So he made a covenant with him and let him go.


35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the LORD, “Strike me, please.” But the man refused to strike him.
36 Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you have departed from me, a lion shall strike you down.” And as soon as he left him, a lion found him and struck him down.
37 Then he found another man and said, “Strike me, please.” And the man struck him and wounded him.
38 So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the road and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes.
39 And as the king passed by, he cried out to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of the battle, and behold, a man turned aside and brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man. If by any means he is missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’
40 And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” And the king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.”
41 Then he hurried to remove the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him that he was of the prophets.
42 And he said to him, “Thus says the LORD: Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall be for his life, and your people for his people.”
43 And the king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria.




Chapter 21


1 Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
2 And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard, so that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house. And I will give you a better vineyard in its place. Or, if it is good in your eyes, I will give you its value in money.”
3 But Naboth said to Ahab, “Far be it from me before the LORD that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.”


4 And Ahab went into his house sullen and angry because of the word that Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him, for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and would not eat food.


5 But Jezebel, his wife, came to him and said, “Why is your spirit so sullen that you are not eating food?”
6 And he said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money, or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard in its place.’ And he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”
7 And Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise and eat food, and let your heart be glad. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”


8 So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived in Naboth’s city and were dwelling with him.
9 And she wrote in the letters, saying, “Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people.
10 And set two worthless men opposite him, and let them testify against him, saying, ‘You cursed God and the king.’ Then carry him out and stone him to death.”


11 And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them, as it was written in the letters that she had sent to them.
12 They proclaimed a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people.
13 Then the two worthless men came in and sat opposite him, and the worthless men testified against him, against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king.” So they carried him out of the city and stoned him to death with stones.
14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.”


15 And as soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money, for Naboth is not alive but dead.”
16 And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab rose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it.


17 Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
18 “Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria. He is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession of it.
19 And you shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: Have you killed and also taken possession?’ And you shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick your blood—even yours.’”


20 And Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, O my enemy?” And he answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD.
21 You will see how I will bring disaster upon you. I will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and free, in Israel.
22 And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.”
23 And of Jezebel the LORD also spoke, saying, “The dogs shall eat Jezebel within the ramparts of Jezreel.”
24 “Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat.”


25 (There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the LORD like Ahab, whom Jezebel his wife incited.
26 He acted very abominably in going after idols, according to all that the Amorites had done, whom the LORD had cast out before the sons of Israel.)


27 And when Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and walked about dejectedly.


28 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
29 “Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the disaster in his days; but in his son’s days I will bring the disaster upon his house.”




Chapter 22


1 For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel.
2 But in the third year, Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
3 And the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us? Yet we are sitting still and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Aram.”
4 And he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?” And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”


5 And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.”
6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?” And they said, “Go up, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.”
7 But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here whom we may inquire?”
8 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah, but I hate him, for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.” And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say so.”
9 Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.”


10 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, clothed in robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘With these you shall push the Arameans until they are consumed.’”
12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and succeed, for the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”


13 And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “See now, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.”
14 But Micaiah said, “As the LORD lives, what the LORD says to me, that I will speak.”


15 And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?” And he answered him, “Go up and succeed, and the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”
16 But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear that you will tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?”
17 And he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd. And the LORD said, ‘These have no master; let each return to his house in peace.’”
18 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not say to you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”


19 And Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left.
20 And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab so that he will go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one said one thing, and another said another.
21 Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD and said, ‘I will entice him.’
22 And the LORD said to him, ‘By what means?’ And he said, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And He said, ‘You shall entice him, and you shall also succeed. Go out and do so.’
23 Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these your prophets, and the LORD has declared disaster concerning you.”


24 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “How did the Spirit of the LORD pass from me to speak to you?”
25 And Micaiah said, “You shall see on that day when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.”
26 And the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son,
27 and say, ‘Thus says the king: Put this man in prison and feed him meager rations of bread and water until I come in peace.’”
28 And Micaiah said, “If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.” And he said, “Hear, all you people!”


29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
30 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.” And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
31 Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, “Do not fight with small or great, but only with the king of Israel.”
32 And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely this is the king of Israel.” So they turned aside to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out.
33 And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.


34 But a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.”
35 And the battle raged that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans, and he died at evening. And the blood from the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.
36 And about sunset a cry passed through the camp, saying, “Every man to his city, and every man to his land!”


37 So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.
38 And they washed the chariot at the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood (now the prostitutes washed themselves there), according to the word of the LORD that He had spoken.
39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did, and the ivory house that he built and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
40 So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.


41 Now Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
42 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
43 And he walked in all the way of Asa his father. He did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD. Yet the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
44 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.


45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he fought, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
46 And the remnant of the male cult prostitutes who remained in the days of his father Asa, he expelled from the land.
47 There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.


48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber.
49 Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat was not willing.


50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son reigned in his place.


51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.
52 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
53 He served Baal and worshiped him and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger in every way that his father had done.﻿2 Kings


Chapter 1


1 After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.


2 And Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Samaria and lay sick. So he sent messengers and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness.”
3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?’
4 Now therefore, thus says the LORD, ‘You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’” And Elijah departed.


5 When the messengers returned to him, he said to them, “Why have you returned?”
6 And they said to him, “A man came up to meet us and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you and say to him, Thus says the LORD: 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’”
7 He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you and told you these things?”
8 They answered him, “He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather around his waist.” And he said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”


9 Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men. And he went up to him, and they found him sitting on the top of a hill. And he said to him, “O man of God, the king says, ‘Come down.’”
10 But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.


11 So the king again sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he said to him, “O man of God, thus says the king: ‘Come down quickly!’”
12 But Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.


13 Then the king again sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and begged him, saying, “O man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight.
14 I know that fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties, but now let my life be precious in your sight.”


15 Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, “Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.” So he arose and went down with him to the king.
16 And he said to him, “Thus says the LORD: Why have you sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.”


17 So he died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son.
18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?




Chapter 2


1 And it came to pass, when the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
2 And Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, please, for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As the LORD lives, and while you yourself continue to live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.
3 Then the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that today the LORD will take your master from over you?” And he said, “Yes, I know about it; be silent.”


4 Then Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here, please, for the LORD has sent me to Jericho.” But he said, “As the LORD lives, and while you yourself continue to live, I will not leave you.” So they continued to Jericho.
5 Then the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that today the LORD will take your master from over you?” And he answered, “Yes, I know about it; be silent.”


6 Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here, please, for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan River.” But he said, “As the LORD lives, and while you yourself continue to live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on.
7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood at a distance from them, while the two of them stood by the Jordan.


8 Then Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water, and the water was divided to the one side and to the other, allowing the two of them to cross over on dry ground.


9 And when they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “Please let there be a double portion of your spirit upon me.”
10 And he said, “You have asked a hard thing. Yet, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.”


11 Then it happened that as they were walking along and talking, that a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
12 And Elisha saw it and cried out, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” And he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.


13 And he picked up the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
14 Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water, saying, “Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?” And when he had struck the water, it was divided to the one side and to the other, and Elisha crossed over.


15 When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho, watching from a distance, saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.
16 And they said to him, “See now, how among your servants there are fifty strong men. Please let them go and search for your master, perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has lifted him up and cast him on some mountain or into some valley.” But he said, “You shall not send.”
17 But when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send.” So they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him.
18 And they returned to him, while he stayed at Jericho. And he said to them, “Didn't I tell you, ‘Don't go’?”


19 Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Look at the situation of this city, it is good, as my lord sees, but the spring of water is bad, causing the land to be unfruitful.”
20 And he said, “Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him.
21 Then he went out to the spring of water and threw salt in it and said, “Thus says the LORD: I have healed this water. No longer shall there be death or unfruitfulness from it.”
22 So the water has been healed to this day, according to the word that Elisha spoke.


23 Then he went up from there to Bethel. And as he was going up along the way, some small boys came out of the city and mocked him and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”
24 And he turned around and looked at them, and he cursed them in the name of the LORD. Then two female bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys.
25 And he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.




Chapter 3


1 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years.
2 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not like his father and mother, for he removed the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
3 Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin; he did not depart from them.


4 Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he used to pay the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.
5 But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
6 So King Jehoram marched out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.
7 And he went and sent word to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to battle against Moab?” And he said, “I will go. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
8 Then he said, “By which way shall we go up?” And he answered, “By way of the wilderness of Edom.”


9 So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. And when they had made a circuit of seven days’ journey, there was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.
10 Then the king of Israel said, “Alas! The LORD has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.”
11 But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, through whom we may inquire of the LORD?” Then one of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.”
12 And Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the LORD is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.


13 Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother.” But the king of Israel said to him, “No, for the LORD has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.”
14 And Elisha said, “As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would neither look at you nor talk to you.
15 However, bring me a musician.” And when the musician played, the hand of the LORD came upon him.
16 And he said, “Thus says the LORD: I will make this dry streambed full of pools.
17 For thus says the LORD: You shall not see wind or rain, yet that streambed shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, you, your livestock, and your animals.
18 This is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD. He will also give the Moabites into your hand,
19 and you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree and stop up all the springs of water and ruin every good piece of land with stones.”


20 The next morning, about the time of the offering of the sacrifice, they saw water came from the direction of Edom, till the country was filled with water.


21 When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear arms and older were called up, and they stood on the border.
22 And when they rose early in the morning, the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.
23 And they said, “This is blood! The kings have surely fought together and struck one another down. Now then, Moab, to the spoil!”
24 But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them. And they went forward, striking the Moabites as they went.
25 And they overthrew the cities, and on every good piece of land each man threw a stone until it was covered. They stopped every spring of water and felled all the good trees, until only its stones were left in Kir-hareseth, and the slingers surrounded it and attacked it.


26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.
27 Then he took his firstborn son who was to reign in his place and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel, and they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.




Chapter 4


1 Now a certain woman, who was the wife of one of the sons of the prophets, cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD. But the creditor has come to take my two sons to be his slaves.”
2 And Elisha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” And she said, “Your servant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.”
3 Then he said, “Go outside, borrow vessels from all your neighbors, empty vessels—and not just a few.
4 Then go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour into all these vessels. And when one jar is full, set it aside.”
5 So she went from him and shut the door behind herself and her sons. They brought the vessels to her, and she poured.
6 When the vessels were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” But he said to her, “There are no more.” Then the oil stopped flowing.
7 She came and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debt, and you and your sons can live on the rest.”


8 Now there came a day when Elisha passed through Shunem, where there was a prominent woman, and she urged him to eat some food. So whenever he passed that way, he turned in there to eat.
9 And she said to her husband, “Listen, I know that this is a holy man of God who continually passes our way.
10 Let us make a little upper room on the wall and put a bed for him there, and a table, a chair, and a lamp, so that whenever he comes to us, he can stay there.”


11 One day he came there, and he turned into the upper room and lay down there.
12 And he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” When he had called her, she stood before him.
13 And he said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Since you have taken all this trouble for us. What can be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king or to the commander of the army?’” But she answered, “I dwell among my own people.”
14 And he said, “Then what is to be done for her?” Gehazi answered, “I noticed that she has no son, and her husband is old.”
15 So he said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the doorway.
16 And he said, “At this time next year, you shall embrace a son.” And she said, “No, my lord, O man of God, do not lie to your servant.”
17 But the woman conceived and bore a son at that season the next year, as Elisha had told her.


18 When the child was grown, one day he went out to his father among the reapers.
19 And he said to his father, “My head, my head!” So he said to a servant, “Carry him to his mother.”
20 When he had lifted him and brought him to his mother, the child sat on her knees until noon, and then he died.
21 And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door behind him and went out.
22 Then she called to her husband and said, “Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so I can hurry to the man of God and return.”
23 He said, “Why will you go to him today? It is neither a new moon nor a Sabbath.” She said, “Let me go in Peace.”


24 Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Drive and go forward; do not slow down the pace for me unless I tell you.”
25 So she went and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her from a distance, he said to Gehazi, his servant, “Look, that is the Shunammite woman.
26 Run now to meet her and say to her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?’” And she answered, “It is well.”
27 When she came to the man of God at the top of the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is bitter within her, and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me.”
28 Then she said, “Did I ask for a son from my lord? Didn't I say, ‘Do not deceive me?’”


29 Then he said to Gehazi, “Put on your cloak, take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer him. But lay my staff on the face of the child.”
30 But the mother of the child said, “As the LORD lives and you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So he arose and followed her.
31 Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the face of the child, but there was neither sound nor response. So he returned to meet him and told him, “The child has not awakened.”


32 When Elisha came into the house, he saw the child lying dead on his bed.
33 So he went in and shut the door behind the two of them and prayed to the LORD.
34 Then he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. And he stretched himself upon him, and the flesh of the child became warm.
35 Then he returned and walked once back and forth in the house, and went up and stretched himself upon him. And the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
36 Then he called Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite.” So he called her. And when she came to him, he said, “Here is your son.”
37 Then she came in and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out.


38 And Elisha returned to Gilgal. Now there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. And he said to his servant, “Set on the large pot and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”
39 And one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, though they did not know what they were.
40 So they poured it out for the men to eat. But as they ate the stew, they cried out, “O man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it.
41 Then he said, “Bring flour.” And he threw it into the pot and said, “Pour it out for the men to eat.” And there was no harm in the pot.


42 A man came from Baal-shalishah, bringing the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And Elisha said, “Give them to the men, that they may eat.”
43 But his servant said, “How can I set this before a hundred men?” So he repeated, “Give them to the men, that they may eat, for thus says the LORD, ‘They shall eat and have some left.’”
44 So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left, according to the word of the LORD.




Chapter 5


1 Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in the sight of his master and highly respected, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. He was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.
2 Now the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken captive a little girl from the land of Israel, and she served Naaman’s wife.
3 And she said to her mistress, “If only my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his leprosy.”
4 So Naaman went in and told his master, saying, “Thus and thus spoke the girl who is from the land of Israel.”
5 Then the king of Aram said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So he went and took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothing.
6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, “Now when this letter reaches you, see that I have sent my servant Naaman to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy.”


7 And when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Only consider and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me.”


8 But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent word to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, so that he may know there is a prophet in Israel.”
9 So Naaman came with his horses and his chariot and stood at the doorway of Elisha’s house.
10 And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan River seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean.”
11 But Naaman became furious and went away, saying, “See here, I said to myself, ‘He will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper.’
12 Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash myself in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.


13 Then his servants came near and spoke to him and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do something great, would you not have done it? How much more then when he says to you, ‘Wash and be clean’?”
14 So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little boy, and he was clean.


15 Then he returned to the man of God with all his company, and came and stood before him and said, “Now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. So now, please accept a gift from your servant.”
16 But he said, “As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will accept nothing.” And though he urged him to take it, he refused.
17 And Naaman said, “If not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth, for your servant will no longer offer burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.
18 In this matter may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, leaning on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon—when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may the LORD pardon your servant in this matter.”
19 And he said to him, “Go in peace.” So he departed from him some distance.


20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “My master has spared this Naaman the Aramean by not accepting from his hand what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him.”
21 So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and said, “Is all well?”
22 And he said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.’”
23 And Naaman said, “Be pleased to take two talents.” And he urged him and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and gave them to two of his servants; and they carried them before him.
24 When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house. Then he sent the men away, and they departed.


25 But he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” And he said, “Your servant went nowhere.”
26 Then he said to him, “Did not my heart go when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to take money and to take clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male and female servants?
27 Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.” So he went out from his presence leprous, as white as snow.




Chapter 6


1 Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Behold now, the place where we dwell before you is too small for us.
2 Please let us go to the Jordan, and each of us take from there a log, and let us make a place there where we may dwell.” And he said, “Go.”
3 Then one said, “Please be willing to go with your servants.” And he answered, “I will go.”
4 So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.
5 But as one was felling a log, the axe head fell into the water. And he cried out and said, “Alas, my master! It was borrowed.”
6 Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And he showed him the place. Then he cut off a stick and threw it in there and made the iron float.
7 And he said, “Take it up.” So he reached out his hand and took it.


8 Now the king of Aram was warring against Israel. And he consulted with his servants, saying, “At such and such a place shall be my camp.”
9 But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, saying, “Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Arameans are coming down there.”
10 And the king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, so that he saved himself there more than once or twice.


11 And the heart of the king of Aram was greatly troubled because of this thing, and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?”
12 Then one of his servants said, “No, my lord, O king, but Elisha the prophet who is in Israel tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”
13 So he said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him.” And it was told him, saying, “We discovered that he is in Dothan.”
14 So he sent horses and chariots and a great army there. And they came by night and surrounded the city.


15 When the servant of the man of God rose early and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. And the servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”
16 And he said, “Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”
17 Then Elisha prayed and said, “O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see.” And the LORD opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.


18 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD and said, “Strike this people, I pray, with blindness.” And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
19 Then Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” And he led them to Samaria.


20 When they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.” And the LORD opened their eyes, and they looked and saw that they were in the midst of Samaria.
21 Then the king of Israel, when he saw them, said to Elisha, “Shall I kill them, shall I kill them, my father?”
22 But he said, “You shall not kill them. Would you kill those you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.”
23 So he prepared a great feast for them, and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the Aramean raiders came no more into the land of Israel.


24 Now after this, it happened that Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army and went up and besieged Samaria.
25 And there was a great famine in Samaria, and they besieged it, until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove’s dung for five shekels of silver.
26 And as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help, my lord the king!”
27 And he said, “If the LORD does not help you, from where shall I help you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?”
28 And the king said to her, “What is your trouble?” And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’
29 So we boiled my son and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him,’ but she has hidden her son.”


30 When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. Now he was passing by on the wall, and the people looked, and saw that he had sackcloth beneath on his body.
31 Then he said, “May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today.”


32 Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man from before him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it fast against him. Is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”
33 While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him, and he said, “This trouble is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?”




Chapter 7


1 Then Elisha said, “Hear the word of the LORD. Thus says the LORD: Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.”
2 Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said, “If the LORD should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?” But he said, “You shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.”


3 Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate, and they said to one another, “Why are we sitting here until we die?
4 If we say, ‘Let us enter the city,’ the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we also die. Now then, come, let us go over to the camp of the Arameans. If they spare our lives, we shall live, and if they kill us, we shall but die.”
5 So they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Arameans. But when they came to the outskirts of the camp of the Arameans, they saw that there was no one there.


6 For the LORD had caused the army of the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and the sound of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, “The king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us.”
7 So they fled away in the twilight and abandoned their tents, their horses, and their donkeys, leaving the camp as it was, and fled for their lives.
8 And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent and ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and clothing, and went and hid them. Then they returned and entered another tent and carried things from there also, and went and hid them.


9 Then they said to one another, “We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news. If we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king’s household.”
10 So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, “We went to the camp of the Arameans, and found that there was no one to be seen or heard there—nothing but the horses tied and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.”
11 Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was told within the king’s household.


12 And the king arose in the night and said to his servants, “I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the open country, thinking, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall capture them alive and get into the city.’”
13 Then one of his servants answered, “Let some men take five of the remaining horses—since those who are left here will fare like all the multitude of Israel who have already perished—let us send and see.”
14 So they took two horsemen, and the king sent them after the army of the Arameans, saying, “Go and see.”


15 So they went after them as far as the Jordan, and saw that all the road was littered with garments and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away in their haste. And the messengers returned and told the king.
16 Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.


17 Now the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said when the king came down to him.
18 For when the man of God had said to the king, “Two seahs of barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, tomorrow about this time at the gate of Samaria,”
19 the captain had answered the man of God, “If the LORD should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?” And he had said, “You shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.”
20 So it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.




Chapter 8


1 Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, “Arise and go, you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn, for the LORD has called for a famine, and it will also come upon the land for seven years.”
2 So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God. She and her household went and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
3 And it came to pass at the end of the seven years that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, and she went out to appeal to the king for her house and her field.
4 Now the king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please relate to me all the great things that Elisha has done.”
5 And as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son he had restored to life came to appeal to the king for her house and her field. And Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.”
6 When the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed an officer for her, saying, “Restore all that was hers, and all the produce of the field from the day she left the land until now.”


7 Then Elisha came to Damascus. Now Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick, and it was told him, saying, “The man of God has come here.”
8 So the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this sickness?’”
9 So Hazael went to meet him and took a gift in his hand, even every good thing of Damascus, forty camel loads, and came and stood before him and said, “Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this sickness?’”
10 And Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You shall surely recover,’ but the LORD has shown me that he shall surely die.”
11 And he fixed his gaze and stared at him until he was ashamed, and the man of God wept.
12 And Hazael said, “Why does my lord weep?” And he answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel: you will set their strongholds on fire, and kill their young men with the sword, and dash their little ones in pieces, and rip open their pregnant women.”
13 Then Hazael said, “But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?” And Elisha answered, “The LORD has shown me that you shall be king over Aram.”
14 So he departed from Elisha and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me that you would surely recover.”
15 But on the next day, he took the cover and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died. And Hazael became king in his place.


16 Now in the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
17 He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
19 Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, since He promised him to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.


20 In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah and set up a king over themselves.
21 So Joram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots, and it happened that he rose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots. But his army fled to their tents.
22 So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.


23 Now the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
24 So Joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Ahaziah his son became king in his place.


25 In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
27 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was related by marriage to the house of Ahab.


28 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram.
29 So King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.




Chapter 9


1 Then Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, “Gird up your loins, and take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
2 When you arrive there, look for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go in and make him rise from among his brothers, and take him into an inner room.
3 Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, ‘Thus says the LORD: I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and flee, and do not delay.”


4 So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
5 And when he arrived, he saw the commanders of the army sitting there. And he said, “I have a message for you, O commander.” And Jehu said, “For which one of us?” And he said, “For you, O commander.”
6 Then he arose and went into the house, and he poured the oil on his head and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.
7 And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.
8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and free in Israel.
9 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.
10 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury her.” Then he opened the door and fled.


11 Then Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and one said to him, “Is all well? Why did this madman come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the man and his talk.”
12 But they said, “It is not true; tell us now.” And he said, “Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: I anoint you king over Israel.’”
13 Then they hurried and took their cloaks and laid them under him on the bare steps, and they blew the trumpet and said, “Jehu is king!”


14 So Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had been keeping watch at Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Aram.
15 But King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael, king of Aram.) And Jehu said, “If this is your intention, let no one escape from the city to go tell it in Jezreel.”
16 Then Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there. And Ahaziah, king of Judah, had come down to see Joram.


17 Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company.” And Joram said, “Take a horseman and send to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’”
18 So a horseman went to meet him and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’” And Jehu said, “What have you to do with peace? Turn and follow me.” And the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger came to them, but he is not returning.”
19 Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’” And Jehu answered, “What have you to do with peace? Turn and follow me.”
20 And the watchman reported, “He came up to them and is not returning. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu, son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”


21 Then Joram said, “Make ready.” And they made his chariot ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah each went out in his chariot to meet Jehu. And they met him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.
22 Now when Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?” And he answered, “What peace, so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her sorceries are so many?”
23 Then Joram turned his hands and fled and said to Ahaziah, “Treachery, O Ahaziah!”
24 And Jehu drew his bow with full strength and struck Joram between the shoulders, and the arrow went through his heart, and he sank down in his chariot.
25 Then Jehu said to Bidkar, his officer, “Take him up and throw him on the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. For remember, when you and I rode together behind Ahab his father, the LORD pronounced this oracle against him:
26 ‘Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will repay you in this field,’ declares the LORD. Now therefore take him and throw him on the field, according to the word of the LORD.”


27 When Ahaziah, king of Judah, saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him and said, “Strike him down also in the chariot.” So they struck him down at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. But he fled to Megiddo and died there.
28 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.
29 In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king over Judah.


30 When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it. And she painted her eyes and adorned her head and looked out of the window.
31 As Jehu entered the gate, she said, “Do you bring peace, Zimri, slayer of your master?”
32 And he lifted up his face to the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” And two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
33 And he said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and he trampled her underfoot.
34 Then he went in and ate and drank, and said, “See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king’s daughter.”
35 But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
36 So they returned and told him. And he said, “This is the word of the LORD which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘In the territory of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel,
37 and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as dung on the surface of the field in the territory of Jezreel, so that they cannot say, “This is Jezebel.”’”




Chapter 10


1 Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, the elders, and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab, saying,
2 “Now when this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses and a fortified city and weapons,
3 select the best and most upright of your master’s sons, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.”
4 But they were exceedingly afraid and said, “If two kings could not stand before him, how then can we stand?”
5 So the overseer of the palace, and the overseer of the city, and the elders, and the guardians sent word to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, and we will do all that you say to us. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your eyes.”


6 Then he wrote a second letter to them, saying, “If you are for me and obey my voice, take the heads of the men—your master’s sons—and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time.” Now the king’s sons, seventy men, were with the great men of the city, who were bringing them up.
7 And when the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and slaughtered seventy persons and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.
8 When the messenger came and told him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons,” he said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.”
9 In the morning he went out and stood and said to all the people, “You are innocent. Behold, I conspired against my master and killed him. But who struck all these?
10 Know then that not one word of the LORD shall fall to the ground, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab. For the LORD has done what He spoke through His servant Elijah.”
11 So Jehu struck down all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all his great men and his acquaintances and his priests, until he left him no survivor.


12 Then he arose, left that place, and traveled to Samaria. On the way, at Beth-eked of the shepherds,
13 Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah, and he said, “Who are you?” And they said, “We are the relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.”
14 Then he said, “Take them alive.” So they took them alive and slaughtered them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two men, and he left none of them.


15 And when he departed from there, he met Jehonadab, son of Rechab, coming to meet him. And he greeted him and said, “Is your heart upright, as my heart is with your heart?” And Jehonadab answered, “It is.” “If it is,” said Jehu, “give me your hand.” So he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.
16 And he said, “Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD.” So he made him ride in his chariot.
17 And when he came to Samaria, he struck down all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to Elijah.


18 Then Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much.
19 Now,  therefore, call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests. Let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live.” But Jehu did it with cunning, in order to destroy the worshipers of Baal.
20 And Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.” So they proclaimed it.
21 And Jehu sent throughout all Israel, and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they went into the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from end to end.
22 Then he said to the one in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out garments for all the worshipers of Baal.” So he brought out garments for them.
23 And Jehu and Jehonadab, son of Rechab, went into the house of Baal. And he said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search and see that none of the servants of the LORD are here with you, but only the worshipers of Baal.”


24 Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside and said, “If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escapes, your life shall be for his life.”
25 Then it came to pass, as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and the officers, “Go in, strike them down; let no one escape.” And they struck them with the edge of the sword, and the guards and the officers threw them out and went into the inner room of the house of Baal.
26 And they brought out the pillar of the house of Baal and burned it.
27 They also broke down the pillar of Baal, and they tore down the house of Baal and made it a latrine to this day.


28 So Jehu wiped out Baal from Israel.
29 But Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin—that is, the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan.
30 And the LORD said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in executing what is right in My eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart, your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.”
31 But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam, which he made Israel sin.


32 In those days the LORD began to reduce Israel, and Hazael struck them throughout all the territory of Israel:
33 from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead—the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites—from Aroer, which is by the Arnon Valley, even Gilead and Bashan.


34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
35 And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.
36 The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.




Chapter 11


1 Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring.
2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being put to death. She placed him and his nurse in a bedroom. So they hid him from Athaliah, and he was not put to death.
3 And he remained hidden with her in the house of the LORD for six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.


4 In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds of the Carites and of the guards, and brought them to him in the house of the LORD. And he made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king’s son.
5 And he commanded them, saying, “This is the thing you shall do: One third of you who come on duty on the Sabbath shall guard the king’s house,
6 and one third shall be at the gate Sur, and one third shall be at the gate behind the guards. You shall take turns guarding the house.
7 The two divisions of you, even all who go off duty on the Sabbath, shall also guard the house of the LORD for the king.
8 Then you shall surround the king on every side, every man with his weapons in his hand. And whoever comes within the ranks shall be put to death. Be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in.”


9 So the captains of hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each took his men who were to come on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were to go off duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
10 The priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and shields that had been King David’s, which were in the house of the LORD.
11 And the guards stood, each with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, around the king.
12 Then he brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him and gave him the testimony. And they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, “Long live the king!”


13 When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and the people, she came to the people at the house of the LORD.
14 And she looked, and behold, the king was standing by the pillar, according to the custom, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, “Treason! Treason!”
15 Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks, and whoever follows her, put to death with the sword.” For the priest had said, “Let her not be put to death in the house of the LORD.”
16 So they laid hands on her, and she went by the way of the horses’ entrance to the king’s house, and there she was put to death.


17 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD’s people, also between the king and the people.
18 And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal and tore it down; they thoroughly broke in pieces its altars and images, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.
19 And he took the captains of hundreds and the Carites and the guards and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guards to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.
20 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death with the sword at the king’s house.
21 Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.




Chapter 12


1 In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
2 And Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all his days, because Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
3 Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away; the people continued to sacrifice and burn incense on the high places.


4 And Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of the LORD, the money each man is assessed, the money from the assessments of persons, and the money that a man's heart prompts him to bring into the house of the LORD,
5 let the priests take, each from his donor, and let them repair the damages of the Temple wherever any damage is found.”
6 But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, the priests had not repaired the damage to the Temple.
7 So King Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them, “Why are you not repairing the damage of the Temple? Now then, take no more money from your donors, but give it for the repair of the house.”
8 So the priests agreed that they would take no more money from the people, and that they would not repair the damage of the Temple.


9 Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid, and he set it beside the altar on the right side as one entered the house of the LORD. And the priests who guarded the threshold put in it all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.
10 And whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king’s scribe and the high priest came up and tied it in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD.
11 Then they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of the LORD. And they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked on the house of the LORD,
12 and to the masons and the stonecutters, and to buy timber and quarried stone to repair the damage of the house of the LORD, and for all that was spent for the house to repair it.
13 But there were not made for the house of the LORD silver basins, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any vessels of gold or of silver, from the money that was brought into the house of the LORD,
14 for that was given to those who did the work, and with it they repaired the house of the LORD.
15 Moreover, they did not require an accounting from the men into whose hands they gave the money to pay out to the workmen, for they dealt honestly.
16 The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD; it belonged to the priests.


17 Then Hazael king of Aram went up and fought against Gath and captured it. And Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem.
18 So Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred gifts that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, the kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred gifts, and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and in the king’s house, and he sent it to Hazael king of Aram. Then he went away from Jerusalem.


19 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
20 And his servants arose and conspired and struck Jehoash down at the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.
21 For Jozacar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died. And they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Amaziah his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 13


1 In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years.
2 He did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from them.
3 So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He gave them continually into the hand of Hazael king of Aram and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael.


4 Then Jehoahaz sought the favor of the LORD, and the LORD listened to him, for He saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Aram oppressed them.
5 Therefore the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they escaped from under the hand of Aram, and the sons of Israel lived in their tents as formerly.
6 Nevertheless, they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he made Israel to sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained standing in Samaria.
7 For he had not left to Jehoahaz an army of more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers, for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.


8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria, and Joash his son reigned in his place.


10 In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years.
11 And he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin, but he walked in them.
12 Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
13 So Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.


14 Now Elisha had fallen sick with the illness of which he would die. So Joash king of Israel came down to him and wept over him and said, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”
15 And Elisha said to him, “Take a bow and arrows.” So he took a bow and arrows.
16 Then he said to the king of Israel, “Draw the bow,” and he drew it. And Elisha laid his hands on the king’s hands.
17 And he said, “Open the window eastward,” and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot,” and he shot. And he said, “The LORD’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Aram! For you shall strike the Arameans in Aphek until you have destroyed them.”
18 Then he said, “Take the arrows,” and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground,” and he struck it three times and stopped.
19 So the man of God was angry with him and said, “You should have struck five or six times, then you would have struck Aram until you had destroyed it. But now you shall strike Aram only three times.”


20 Then Elisha died, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabite raiders would enter the land in the spring of the year.
21 And it came about, as they were burying a man, they saw a band of raiders, so they cast the man into the grave of Elisha. And when the man's corpse touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood up on his feet.


22 Now Hazael king of Aram had oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
23 But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them and turned toward them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and He was not willing to destroy them, nor has He cast them from His presence until now.


24 When Hazael king of Aram died, Ben-hadad his son became king in his place.
25 Then Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken in war from the hand of Jehoahaz his father. Three times Joash defeated him, and he recovered the cities of Israel.




Chapter 14


1 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah son of Joash, king of Judah, began to reign.
2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
3 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not like David his father. He did according to all that his father Joash had done.
4 However, the high places were not removed; the people continued to sacrifice and burn incense on the high places.
5 And it came about, as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his hand, that he struck down his servants who had struck down the king his father.
6 But the sons of the assassins he did not put to death, according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, “Fathers shall not be put to death for sons, and sons shall not be put to death for fathers; but each one shall be put to death for his own sin.”


7 He struck down ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Sela in battle, and he called its name Joktheel to this day.


8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us meet face to face.”
9 But Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “A thistle in Lebanon sent to a cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as a wife.’ But a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.
10 You have indeed struck down Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your glory and stay at home. Why should you provoke trouble so that you fall—you and Judah with you?”


11 But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah confronted each other at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
12 And Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled, each to his tent.
13 Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, son of Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. And he came to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits.
14 And he took all the gold and silver and all the utensils that were found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king’s house, along with hostages, and returned to Samaria.


15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash that he did, and his might and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
16 And Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel, and Jeroboam his son became king in his place.


17 Amaziah son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
18 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
19 And they conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.
20 And they brought him on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.


21 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
22 He rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers.


23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, began to reign in Samaria, and he reigned forty-one years.
24 And he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
25 He restored the border of Israel from Lebo-hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, which He spoke through His servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet, who was from Gath-hepher.
26 For the LORD saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter, and that there was neither bond nor free, and there was no helper for Israel.
27 But the LORD had not said that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, so He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Joash.


28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did and his might, how he fought and how he recovered Damascus and Hamath for Israel, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
29 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, with the kings of Israel, and Zechariah his son became king in his place.




Chapter 15


1 In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah the son of Amaziah king of Judah began to reign.
2 He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
3 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.
4 Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
5 And the LORD struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and he lived in a separate house. And Jotham, the king’s son, was over the household, governing the people of the land.
6 Now the rest of the acts of Azariah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
7 And Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Jotham his son reigned in his place.


8 In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months.
9 He did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, as his fathers had done. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
10 Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck him down before the people, and killed him, and reigned in his place.
11 Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
12 This was the word of the LORD that he spoke to Jehu: “Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.” And so it came to pass.


13 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned one month in Samaria.
14 Then Menahem the son of Gadi came up from Tirzah and came to Samaria, and struck down Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and killed him, and reigned in his place.
15 Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the conspiracy that he made, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.


16 Then Menahem struck Tiphsah and all who were in it and its territory from Tirzah, because they did not open it to him; therefore he struck it, and he ripped open all the women who were pregnant.
17 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel, and he reigned ten years in Samaria.
18 He did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD. He did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.


19 Pul the king of Assyria came against the land, and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
20 Menahem exacted the money from Israel, from all the mighty men of wealth, fifty shekels of silver from each man, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back and did not stay there in the land.
21 Now the rest of the acts of Menahem and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
22 And Menahem slept with his fathers, and Pekahiah his son reigned in his place.


23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned two years.
24 He did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD and did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
25 And Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him and struck him down in Samaria in the citadel of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh; he had with him fifty men of the Gileadites. And he killed him and reigned in his place.
26 Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah and all that he did, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.


27 In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twenty years.
28 He did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
29 In the days of Pekah, king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried the people captive to Assyria.
30 Then Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah and struck him and killed him, and reigned in his place in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
31 Now the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.


32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah began to reign.
33 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
34 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done.
35 Nevertheless, the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD.
36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
37 In those days the LORD began to send Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah.
38 And Jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 16


1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
2 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God, as his father David had done,
3 but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even caused his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the sons of Israel.
4 And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.


5 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war. They besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him.
6 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath for Syria and drove the men of Judah out of Elath, and the Syrians came to Elath and have lived there to this day.
7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and deliver me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me.”
8 Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king's house, and sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.
9 So the king of Assyria listened to him. And the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and captured it and carried its people captive to Kir, and he killed Rezin.


10 Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria. And he saw the altar that was at Damascus, and King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest the pattern of the altar and its model, according to all its workmanship.
11 So Uriah the priest built the altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. Uriah the priest made it before King Ahaz came from Damascus.
12 When the king came from Damascus and saw the altar, the king approached the altar and offered sacrifices on it.
13 He burned his burnt offering and his grain offering and poured out his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.


14 And the bronze altar that was before the LORD he brought from the front of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and he put it on the north side of the new altar.
15 Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, “Upon the great altar offer the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering and the king’s burnt offering and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their grain offering and their drink offerings. And sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.”


16 So Uriah the priest did according to all that King Ahaz commanded.
17 And King Ahaz cut off the frames of the stands and removed the basins from them, and he took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a pavement of stone.
18 And the covered way for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s outer entrance, he removed from the house of the LORD because of the king of Assyria.
19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
20 And Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 17


1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years.
2 And he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him.
3 Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his servant and paid him tribute.
4 But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea, for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.
5 Then the king of Assyria went up against all the land, and he went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years.
6 In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria, and he carried Israel away to Assyria and settled them in Halah and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.


7 Now this came about because the sons of Israel sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up from the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods.
8 And they walked in the statutes of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the sons of Israel, and in the statutes of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
9 And the sons of Israel secretly did things that were not right against the LORD their God. They built for themselves high places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city.
10 They set up for themselves pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree,
11 and they burned incense there on all the high places, like the nations whom the LORD had exiled before them. They did evil things, provoking the LORD to anger.
12 They served idols, about which the LORD had said to them, “You shall not do this thing.”


13 Yet the LORD had warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.”
14 But they did not listen, and they stiffened their necks like the necks of their fathers, who did not believe in the LORD their God.
15 They rejected his statutes and his covenant that he had made with their fathers and his warnings with which he had warned them. They followed vanity and became vain, and followed after the nations that surrounded them, about whom the LORD had commanded them not to do like them.
16 They abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God and made for themselves cast images, two calves, and made an Asherah and bowed down to all the host of heaven and served Baal.
17 And they made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire, and they practiced divination and augury and sold themselves to do what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
18 So the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from his presence; none was left except the tribe of Judah alone.


19 Judah also did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel, which they had made.
20 So the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had cast them out of his presence.
21 For he tore Israel from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam son of Nebat king. And Jeroboam drove Israel away from following the LORD and made them commit great sin.
22 And the sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam that he did; they did not depart from them,
23 until the LORD removed Israel from his presence, as he had spoken through all his servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from its own land to Assyria until this day.


24 Then the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the sons of Israel. And they took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.
25 At the beginning of their dwelling there, they did not fear the LORD. Therefore the LORD sent lions among them, and they killed some of them.
26 So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations which you have carried away and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them, because they do not know the law of the god of the land.”
27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Take there one of the priests whom you carried away from there, and let him go and live there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.”
28 So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and he taught them how they should fear the LORD.


29 But every nation made its own gods and set them in the shrines of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.
30 And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima,
31 and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelek and Anammelek, the gods of Sepharvaim.
32 They also feared the LORD and appointed from among themselves priests of the high places, who acted for them in the shrines of the high places.
33 They feared the LORD and served their own gods, according to the custom of the nations from which they had been exiled.


34 To this day they act according to the former customs. They do not fear the LORD, and they do not do according to their statutes, or their ordinances, or the law, or the commandment that the LORD commanded the sons of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
35 The LORD had made a covenant with them and commanded them, saying, “You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them.
36 But the LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm, him you shall fear, and to him you shall bow yourselves, and to him you shall sacrifice.
37 And the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment that he wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever. And you shall not fear other gods.
38 And the covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, nor shall you fear other gods.
39 But the LORD your God you shall fear, and he will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.”


40 Yet they did not listen, but they acted according to their former custom.
41 So these nations feared the LORD and also served their carved images; their children likewise, and their children’s children—as their fathers did, so they do until this day.




Chapter 18


1 Now it came about in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
2 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abi, daughter of Zechariah.
3 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
4 He removed the high places, and broke down the pillars, and cut down the Asherah. And he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the sons of Israel had been burning incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.
5 He trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel, so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among those who were before him.
6 For he clung to the LORD; he did not turn away from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.
7 And the LORD was with him; wherever he went he prospered. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
8 He struck the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.


9 Now it came about in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, came up against Samaria and besieged it.
10 And at the end of three years they captured it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was captured.
11 Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria and settled them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,
12 because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded. They neither listened nor obeyed.


13 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
14 Then Hezekiah, king of Judah, sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have sinned. Withdraw from me; whatever you impose on me I will bear.” So the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah, king of Judah, three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
15 And Hezekiah gave all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king’s house.
16 At that time Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD and from the doorposts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.


17 Then the king of Assyria sent the commander-in-chief, the chief officer, and the chief of staff from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. So they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they went up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway to the fuller’s field.
18 When they called for the king, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, went out to them.
19 And the chief of staff said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: What is this confidence in which you trust?
20 You say (but they are only empty words), “There is counsel and might for war.” Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me?
21 Now behold, you rely on the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, which, if a man leans on it, it will pierce his hand. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him.
22 But if you say to me, “We rely on the LORD our God,” is it not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, “You shall bow down before this altar in Jerusalem”?
23 Now therefore, I urge you, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses—if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
24 How then can you repulse one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
25 Have I now come up without the LORD’s approval against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it.”’”


26 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah said to the chief of staff, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak with us in Judean in the ears of the people who are on the wall.”
27 But the chief of staff said to them, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their dung and drink their urine with you?”
28 Then the chief of staff stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean, and said, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.
29 Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you from my hand.
30 Nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, “The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”
31 Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: “Make your peace with me, and come out to me, and each of you shall eat of his own vine and each of his own fig tree, and each of you shall drink the water of his own cistern,
32 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey, that you may live and not die.” But do not listen to Hezekiah, when he misleads you, saying, “The LORD will deliver us.”
33 Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
34 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
35 Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their land from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’”


36 But the people were silent and did not answer him a word, for the commandment of the king was, “Do not answer him.”
37 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they reported to him the words of the chief of staff.




Chapter 19


1 Now when King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
3 They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; for children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver.
4 It may be the LORD your God will hear all the words of the chief of staff, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left.”


5 So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
6 And Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the LORD: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
7 Watch and you will see that I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumor and shall return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.’”


8 Then the chief of staff returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had withdrawn from Lachish.
9 Now he heard them say of Tirhakah king of Cush, “Look, he has set out to fight against you.” So he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
10 “Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, ‘Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’
11 You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, devoting them to destruction. And yet will you be delivered?
12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my fathers destroyed—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?
13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and of Ivvah?”


14 Then Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. And Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
15 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD and said, “O LORD, the God of Israel, who sits above the cherubim, you alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
16 Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God.
17 Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,
18 and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them.
19 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us, I pray, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O LORD, are God alone.”


20 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: That which you have prayed to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
21 This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him:


The virgin daughter of Zion despises you, she scorns you;
the daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head behind you.


22 Whom have you reproached and blasphemed?
Against whom have you raised your voice
and lifted up your eyes on high?
Against the Holy One of Israel!


23 By your messengers you have reproached the Lord,
and you have said, ‘With the multitude of my chariots
I have gone up to the height of the mountains,
to the remotest parts of Lebanon;
and I cut down its tall cedars,
its choice cypresses,
and I entered its farthest lodging place,
its thickest forest.


24 I dug wells and drank foreign waters,
and with the sole of my feet I dried up
all the rivers of Egypt.’


25 Have you not heard? Long ago I made it,
from days of old I formed it.
Now I have brought it to pass,
that you should turn fortified cities
into heaps of ruin.


26 Therefore their inhabitants, powerless,
were dismayed and put to shame;
they were like the grass of the field and the green herb,
like grass on the housetops, scorched before it grows.


27 But I know your sitting down and your going out and your coming in,
and your raging against me.


28 Because you have raged against me,
and your arrogance has come up to my ears,
therefore I will put my hook in your nose
and my bridle in your lips,
and I will turn you back
by the way in which you came.


29 And this shall be the sign for you: This year you shall eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs of the same; then in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
30 The surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
31 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the LORD will perform this.


32 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast up a siege ramp against it.
33 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and into this city he shall not come, declares the LORD.
34 For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of David my servant.”


35 And that night the angel of the LORD went out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. And when men arose early in the morning, they saw all the dead bodies.
36 So Sennacherib, king of Assyria, departed and went back, and lived in Nineveh.
37 And it came about, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 20


1 In those days Hezekiah became sick to the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.”
2 Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, saying,
3 “Remember now, O LORD, I pray, how I have walked before you in truth and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.


4 And it came to pass, before Isaiah had gone out to the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
5 “Return and say to Hezekiah the leader of my people, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you; on the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD.
6 And I will add to your days fifteen years, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake and for the sake of David my servant.’”
7 Then Isaiah said, “Take a cake of figs.” So they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.


8 Now Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the LORD the third day?”
9 And Isaiah said, “This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or shall it go back ten steps?”
10 And Hezekiah answered, “It is easy for the shadow to go forward ten steps; no, but let the shadow turn backward ten steps.”
11 So Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD, and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz.


12 At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
13 And Hezekiah gave heed to them, and showed them all his treasure house—the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil—and his armory, and all that was found among his treasures; there was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.
14 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” And Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, from Babylon.”
15 And he said, “What have they seen in your house?” And Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”


16 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD:
17 Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the LORD.
18 And some of your own sons who shall issue from you, whom you shall father, shall be taken away; and they shall become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
19 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD which you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “Is it not so, if there will be peace and truth in my days?”


20 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might, and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
21 So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 21


1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hephzibah.
2 And he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel.
3 For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed, and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and he worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.
4 He built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “In Jerusalem I will put my name.”
5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
6 And he made his son pass through the fire, practiced soothsaying and divination, and dealt with mediums and with spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.


7 He set the carved image of Asherah that he had made in the house of which the LORD had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever;
8 and I will not again cause the foot of Israel to wander from the land that I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.”
9 But they did not listen, and Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the sons of Israel.


10 And the LORD spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
11 “Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations, having done more evil than all that the Amorites did who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols,
12 therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing such evil on Jerusalem and Judah that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.
13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plumb line of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
14 I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall become plunder and spoil to all their enemies,
15 because they have done what is evil in my eyes and have been provoking me to anger since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.”


16 Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides his sin by which he made Judah to sin, in doing what was evil in the eyes of the LORD.
17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did, and his sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
18 And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his place.


19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
20 And he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done.
21 He walked in all the way in which his father had walked, and served the idols that his father had served, and worshiped them.
22 He forsook the LORD, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD.


23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him and put the king to death in his own house.
24 But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.


25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
26 And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 22


1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
2 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and did not turn aside to the right or to the left.


3 Now in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,
4 “Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money brought into the house of the LORD which the doorkeepers have collected from the people,
5 and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD, and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,
6 to the carpenters and the builders and the masons, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
7 But no accounting shall be asked of them for the money that is delivered into their hand, for they deal faithfully.”


8 Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD.” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought word back to the king, and said, “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD.”
10 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king.
11 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, that he tore his clothes.


12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,
13 “Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for the people and for all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.”


14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (she dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter); and they spoke with her.
15 And she said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me,
16 ‘Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am bringing evil on this place and on its inhabitants, all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read,
17 because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.’


18 But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus you shall say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Concerning the words that you have heard,
19 because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and you tore your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares the LORD.
20 Therefore, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place.’” And they brought back word to the king.




Chapter 23


1 Then the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 And the king went up to the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD.
3 And the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people entered into the covenant.


4 Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to bring out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven. And he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.
5 And he did away with the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense on the high places in the cities of Judah and in the surroundings of Jerusalem—those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and the moon and the constellations and all the host of heaven.
6 And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the LORD, outside Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron and ground it to dust, and threw its dust on the graves of the sons of the people.
7 He also tore down the houses of the male cult prostitutes which were in the house of the LORD, where the women were weaving hangings for the Asherah.
8 And he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba. And he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left at the city gate.
9 Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not go up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.


10 He also defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, so that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire for Molech.
11 And he removed the horses which the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the officer, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
12 And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, the king broke down, and he smashed them there and threw their dust into the brook Kidron.
13 The king defiled the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right of the Mount of Destruction, which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the sons of Ammon.
14 He broke in pieces the pillars and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with human bones.


15 Moreover, the altar that was at Bethel, the high place which Jeroboam son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place, crushed it to dust, and burned the Asherah.
16 Then Josiah turned and saw the graves that were there on the mountain, and he sent and took the bones from the graves and burned them on the altar, and defiled it according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who had foretold these things.
17 Then he said, “What is this monument that I see?” And the men of the city told him, “It is the grave of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel.”
18 And he said, “Let him be; let no man disturb his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed, with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.


19 Josiah also removed all the houses of the high places which were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger; and he did to them according to all the deeds which he had done in Bethel.
20 And he slaughtered all the priests of the high places who were there on the altars, and burned human bones on them; then he returned to Jerusalem.


21 The king commanded all the people, saying, “Keep the Passover to the LORD your God as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.”
22 For such a Passover had not been kept from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.
23 But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover was kept to the LORD in Jerusalem.


24 Moreover, Josiah removed the mediums and the spiritists and the household gods and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might establish the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.
25 And before him there was no king like him who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him.


26 Nevertheless, the LORD did not turn from the fierceness of his great wrath with which his anger burned against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him.
27 And the LORD said, “I will also remove Judah from my presence as I have removed Israel, and I will reject this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, ‘My name shall be there.’”


28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
29 In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates, and King Josiah went to meet him; but Neco killed him at Megiddo when he saw him.
30 And his servants carried him dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place.


31 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
32 And he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
33 Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and imposed on the land a fine of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
34 And Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away and brought him to Egypt, and he died there.
35 So Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land to give the money according to Pharaoh’s command. He exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, each according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Neco.


36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
37 And he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.




Chapter 24


1 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him.


2 The LORD sent against him bands of Chaldeans, bands of Arameans, bands of Moabites, and bands of Ammonites; He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD that He spoke by His servants the prophets.


3 Surely this happened to Judah at the command of the LORD, to remove them out of His sight because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done,
4 and also for the innocent blood that he had shed, for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the LORD was not willing to forgive.


5 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
6 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.


7 The king of Egypt did not come out of his land again, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates.


8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
9 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.


10 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon went up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
11 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it,
12 and Jehoiachin king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officials; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.


13 He carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the gold vessels which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.
14 He carried away all Jerusalem, all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained except the poorest of the people of the land.
15 He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s mother, the king’s wives, his officials, and the leading men of the land he took into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
16 All the men of might, seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths, one thousand, all strong and fit for war, the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.


17 The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.


18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
19 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
20 For because of the anger of the LORD, this came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah until He cast them out of His presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.




Chapter 25


1 In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and they camped against it and built a siege wall all around it.
2 So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
3 On the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.


4 Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled by night by way of the gate between the two walls, beside the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans were surrounding the city; and the king went by the way of the Arabah.
5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.
6 Then they seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they passed sentence upon him.
7 They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, then put out the eyes of Zedekiah, bound him with bronze shackles, and brought him to Babylon.


8 In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month (that was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
9 He burned the house of the LORD, the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned with fire.
10 And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem.


11 Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried away the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the population.
12 But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.


13 The bronze pillars that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon.
14 They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the ladles, and all the bronze vessels used in the temple service.
15 The captain of the guard took away the firepans and the basins, whatever was of pure gold or of silver.
16 The two pillars, the one sea, and the stands that Solomon had made for the house of the LORD—the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weighing.
17 The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a bronze capital was on it; the height of the capital was three cubits, with a network and pomegranates all around, all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these, with the network.


18 The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold.
19 From the city he took one officer who was in charge of the men of war, five men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city, the scribe of the captain of the host who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.
20 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
21 The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah went into exile from its land.


22 Now as for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over them.
23 When all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—namely Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite—they and their men.
24 Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, saying, “Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Remain in the land, serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.”


25 But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of royal descent, came with ten men and struck down Gedaliah, and he died, along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
26 Then all the people, small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.


27 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison.
28 He spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
29 He changed his prison clothes, and he ate regularly in the king’s presence all the days of his life.
30 For his allowance, a regular portion was given him by the king, a daily amount, all the days of his life.﻿First Chronicles

19 When Azubah died, Caleb married Ephrath, and she bore him Hur.
20 Hur fathered Uri, and Uri fathered Bezalel.


21 Afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the father of Gilead, whom he married when he was sixty years old, and she bore him Segub.
22 Segub fathered Jair, who had twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead.

10 Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, “Oh that You would bless me indeed and enlarge my border, and that Your hand might be with me, and that You would keep me from harm so that it might not hurt me!” And God granted what he asked.


11 Chelub the brother of Shuhah fathered Mehir, who was the father of Eshton.

39 They journeyed to the entrance of Gedor, to the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks,
40 and they found rich and good pasture, and the land was very broad, quiet, and peaceful; for the former inhabitants there belonged to Ham.


41 These, recorded by name, came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and struck down their tents and the Meunites who were found there, and they devoted them to destruction to this day, and settled in their place, because there was pasture there for their flocks.
42 And some of them, five hundred men of the sons of Simeon, went to Mount Seir, with Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, as their leaders.
43 They struck down the remnant of the Amalekites who had escaped, and they have lived there to this day.




Chapter 5


1 The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, for he was the firstborn, but because he defiled his father’s couch, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, so that he is not enrolled in the genealogy according to the birthright.


2 Though Judah became strong among his brothers and a prince came from him, yet the birthright belonged to Joseph.


3 the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.


4 The sons of Joel: Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,
5 Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son,
6 and Beerah his son, whom Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria carried into exile. He was a chief of the Reubenites.


7 And his kinsmen by their clans, when the genealogy of their generations was recorded: Jeiel the chief, and Zechariah,
8 and Bela the son of Azaz, son of Shema, son of Joel, who lived in Aroer, as far as Nebo and Baal-meon.
9 He also lived to the east as far as the entrance of the wilderness from the Euphrates River, because their livestock had multiplied in the land of Gilead.


10 In the days of Saul they made war with the Hagrites, who fell into their hand. And they lived in their tents throughout all the region east of Gilead.


11 The sons of Gad lived next to them in the land of Bashan as far as Salecah:
12 Joel was the chief, Shapham the second, Janai and Shaphat in Bashan.
13 And their kinsmen according to their fathers’ houses: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber, seven.


14 These were the sons of Abihail the son of Huri, son of Jaroah, son of Gilead, son of Michael, son of Jeshishai, son of Jahdo, son of Buz.
15 Ahi the son of Abdiel, son of Guni, was chief in their fathers’ house.
16 They lived in Gilead, in Bashan and in its towns, and in all the pasturelands of Sharon to their limits.


17 All of these were recorded in genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.


18 The sons of Reuben, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh—valiant men, men who carried shield and sword, who drew the bow, and who were trained for war—44,760, able to go out to war.
19 They made war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.
20 They received help against them, and the Hagrites and all who were with them were given into their hand, for they cried out to God in the battle, and He answered them, because they trusted in Him.
21 They captured their livestock: fifty thousand camels, two hundred fifty thousand sheep, two thousand donkeys, and one hundred thousand men alive.
22 For many fell slain, because the war was of God. And they lived in their place until the exile.


23 The sons of the half-tribe of Manasseh lived in the land. They increased from Bashan to Baal-hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon.
24 These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel—mighty warriors, men of renown, heads of their fathers’ houses.


25 But they broke faith with the God of their fathers and whored after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
26 So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, the spirit of Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and he carried them away—namely, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh—and brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river Gozan, to this day.

49 But Aaron and his sons made offerings on the altar of burnt offering and on the altar of incense for all the work of the Most Holy Place, and to make atonement for Israel, according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded.

19 Jakim, Zichri, Zabdi,
20 Elienai, Zillethai, Eliel,
21 Adaiah, Beraiah, and Shimrath were the sons of Shimei.
22 Ishpan, Eber, Eliel,
23 Abdon, Zichri, Hanan,
24 Hananiah, Elam, Anthothijah,
25 Iphdeiah, and Penuel were the sons of Shashak.


26 Shamsherai, Shehariah, Athaliah,
27 Jaareshiah, Elijah, and Zichri were the sons of Jeroham.
28 These were heads of fathers’ houses according to their generations, chief men; they lived in Jerusalem.


29 Now in Gibeon lived the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, and the name of his wife was Maacah,
30 and his firstborn son was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Nadab,
31 Gedor, Ahio, and Zecher.
32 Mikloth fathered Shimeah. And they also lived with their relatives in Jerusalem opposite their kinsmen.


33 And Ner fathered Kish, and Kish fathered Saul, and Saul fathered Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
34 And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal, and Merib-baal fathered Micah.
35 And the sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tarea, and Ahaz.
36 And Ahaz fathered Jehoaddah, and Jehoaddah fathered Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri fathered Moza.
37 Moza fathered Binea; Raphah was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.
38 And Azel had six sons, and these were their names: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. All these were the sons of Azel.
39 And the sons of Eshek his brother: Ulam his firstborn, Jeush the second, and Eliphelet the third.
40 And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valor, archers, and they had many sons and grandsons, 150. All these were of the sons of Benjamin.




Chapter 9


1 So all Israel was enrolled by genealogies, and behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel. And Judah was taken into exile to Babylon because of their unfaithfulness.
2 Now the first inhabitants who lived again in their possessions in their cities were Israelites, the priests, the Levites, and the temple servants.


3 And in Jerusalem lived some of the sons of Judah, and of the sons of Benjamin, and of the sons of Ephraim and Manasseh:
4 Uthai the son of Ammihud, son of Omri, son of Imri, son of Bani, from the sons of Perez the son of Judah.
5 And from the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn and his sons.
6 And from the sons of Zerah: Jeuel and their kinsmen, 690.
7 And from the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, son of Hodaviah, son of Hassenuah,
8 and Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah, son of Reuel, son of Ibnijah.
9 And their kinsmen according to their generations, 956. All these were heads of fathers’ houses according to their ancestral houses.


10 And of the priests: Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, Jachin,
11 and Azariah the son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, chief officer of the house of God;
12 and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, son of Pashhur, son of Malchijah, and Maasai the son of Adiel, son of Jahzerah, son of Meshullam, son of Meshillemith, son of Immer;
13 and their kinsmen, heads of their fathers’ houses, 1,760, mighty men for the work of the service of the house of God.


14 And of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;
15 and Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Mica, son of Zichri, son of Asaph;
16 and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun; and Berechiah the son of Asa, son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of the Netophathites.


17 Now the gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their kinsmen (Shallum was the chief),
18 who previously stood at the king’s gate on the east side. These were the gatekeepers for the camp of the sons of Levi.
19 And Shallum the son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his kinsmen of his father’s house, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tent, as their fathers had been in charge of the camp of the LORD, keepers of the entrance.
20 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler over them in time past, and the LORD was with him.
21 Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
22 All these who were chosen as gatekeepers at the thresholds were 212. They were enrolled by genealogy in their villages. David and Samuel the seer had established them in their trusted office.
23 So they and their sons were in charge of the gates of the house of the LORD, that is, the house of the tent, as guards.
24 The gatekeepers were on the four sides, east, west, north, and south. ***
25 And their kinsmen in their villages were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them.
26 For the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted to be over the chambers and the treasuries of the house of God.
27 And they spent the night around the house of God, for on them lay the duty of watching, and they had charge of opening it every morning.


28 And some of them had charge of the vessels of service, for they were required to count them when they were brought in and taken out.
29 Some of them were appointed over the furniture and over all the holy vessels, also over the fine flour, the wine, the oil, the frankincense, and the spices.
30 And some of the sons of the priests prepared the mixing of the spices.
31 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was entrusted with the work of making the flat cakes.
32 Also some of their kinsmen of the sons of the Kohathites had charge of the showbread, to prepare it every Sabbath.


33 Now these are the singers, heads of fathers’ houses of the Levites, who lived in the chambers of the temple free from other service, for they were on duty day and night.
34 These were heads of fathers’ houses of the Levites, according to their generations, leaders. These lived in Jerusalem.


35 In Gibeon lived the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, and the name of his wife was Maacah.
36 And his firstborn son was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
37 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth.
38 And Mikloth fathered Shimeam. And they also lived with their kinsmen in Jerusalem, opposite their kinsmen.
39 And Ner fathered Kish, and Kish fathered Saul, and Saul fathered Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
40 And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal, and Merib-baal fathered Micah.
41 The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz.
42 And Ahaz fathered Jarah, and Jarah fathered Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri fathered Moza.
43 Moza fathered Binea, and his son was Rephaiah, his son Eleasah, his son Azel.
44 Azel had six sons, and these are their names: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel.




Chapter 10


1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel. And the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
2 And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons. And the Philistines struck down Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
3 And the battle pressed hard against Saul. And the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.


4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.” But his armor-bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
5 And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword and died.
6 Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together.
7 And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and lived in them.


8 And on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
9 And they stripped him and took his head and his armor and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.
10 And they put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.


11 But when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
12 all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.


13 So Saul died for his breach of faith. He broke faith with the LORD in that he did not keep the command of the LORD and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance,
14 and did not seek guidance from the LORD. Therefore he put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.




Chapter 11


1 Then all Israel gathered to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
2 In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the LORD your God said to you, ‘You shall shepherd My people Israel, and you shall be ruler over My people Israel.’”
3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
4 Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus), and the Jebusites were the inhabitants of the land.
5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You shall not come in here.” Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion, which is now the city of David.
6 David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and commander.” And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.
7 David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.
8 He built the city all around, from the Millo even to the surrounding area, and Joab restored the rest of the city.
9 David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts was with him.


10 Now these are the chiefs of David’s mighty men, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
11 These are the numbers of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam son of Hachmoni, chief of the thirty; he wielded his spear against three hundred whom he killed at one time.
12 And after him was Eleazar son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
13 He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the troops fled before the Philistines.
14 But they took their stand in the midst of the field and defended it, and struck down the Philistines, and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.
15 Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, while the army of the Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
16 David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
17 David longed and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!”
18 So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and carried it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it. He poured it out to the LORD
19 and said, “Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.” Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.
20 Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty. He wielded his spear against three hundred and killed them and won a name beside the three.
21 He was more honored than the thirty and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.
22 And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and struck a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
23 And he struck down an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver’s beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff, and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.
24 These things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did, and won a name beside the three mighty men.
25 He was more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.
26 The mighty men of the armies were: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
28 Ira son of Ikkesh of Tekoa, Abiezer of Anathoth,
29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,
31 Ithai son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjaminites, Benaiah of Pirathon,
32 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
33 Azmaveth of Baharum, Eliahba of Shaalbon,
34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
35 Ahiam son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur,
36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
37 Hezro of Carmel, Naarai son of Ezbai,
38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri,
39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,
42 Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,
43 Hanan son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,
44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
45 Jediael son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
46 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,
47 Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.




Chapter 12


1 Now these are the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was still restricted because of Saul son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, helpers in war.
2 They were armed with bows and could use both the right hand and the left to sling stones and shoot arrows from the bow; they were from the tribe of Benjamin, Saul’s brethren.
3 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; also Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite;
4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty and a leader over the thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite;
5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite;
6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites;
7 and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.


8 From the Gadites there went over to David at the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty and valiant men, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear. Their faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as gazelles on the mountains.
9 Ezer was the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
13 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.
14 These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army; the least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to a thousand.
15 These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west.


16 Some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah also came to David at the stronghold.
17 David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be united with you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, though my hands have done no wrong, may the God of our fathers look on it and judge.”
18 Then the Spirit clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, and he said: “We are yours, David, and with you, son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers, for your God helps you.” So David received them and made them captains of the troop.


19 Some from Manasseh joined David when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle, but they did not help them. For the rulers of the Philistines, after counsel, sent him away, saying, “He may desert to his master Saul at the cost of our heads.”
20 As he went to Ziklag, there defected to him from Manasseh: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who belonged to Manasseh.
21 They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and were commanders in the army.
22 For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army like the army of God.


23 Now these are the numbers of the armed men who came to David at Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, according to the word of the LORD:
24 The sons of Judah who bore shield and spear were 6,800 armed for war.
25 From the sons of Simeon, mighty men of valor for war, 7,100.
26 From the sons of Levi, 4,600.
27 Jehoiada was the leader of the house of Aaron, and with him were 3,700,
28 and Zadok, a young man mighty in valor, and twenty-two captains from his father’s house.
29 From the sons of Benjamin, Saul’s kinsmen, 3,000; for until that time the majority of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul.
30 From the sons of Ephraim 20,800 mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers’ houses.
31 From the half-tribe of Manasseh 18,000, who were designated by name to come and make David king.
32 From the sons of Issachar, men who understood the times, with knowledge of what Israel ought to do, their chiefs were 200, and all their kinsmen were at their command.
33 From Zebulun, those going out to battle, trained for war with all weapons of war, 50,000, ready to give undivided loyalty.
34 From Naphtali 1,000 captains, and with them 37,000 with shield and spear.
35 From the Danites, those arrayed for battle, 28,600.
36 From Asher, those going out to battle, trained for war, 40,000.
37 And from the other side of the Jordan, from the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all kinds of weapons for war, 120,000.


38 All these, men of war, who could draw up in battle formation, came to Hebron with a whole heart to make David king over all Israel. And all the rest of Israel were of one mind to make David king.
39 And they were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their kinsmen had prepared for them.
40 Also those who were near them, from as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—provisions of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and sheep in abundance, for there was joy in Israel.




Chapter 13


1 David consulted with the commanders of the thousands and of the hundreds, with every leader.
2 And David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if it is from the LORD our God, let us send word everywhere to our kinsmen who remain in all the land of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who are with them in their cities with pasturelands, that they may gather to us.
3 And let us bring back the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul.”
4 Then all the assembly agreed to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
5 So David assembled all Israel from Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
6 And David went up with all Israel to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belongs to Judah, to bring from there the ark of God, the LORD who is enthroned above the cherubim, where His name is called upon.


7 And they carried the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, with Uzza and Ahio driving the cart.
8 David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, and with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets.
9 But when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, because the oxen had stumbled.
10 And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzza, and He struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark; and he died there before God.
11 Then David became upset because the LORD stuck down Uzza; and he called that place Perez-uzza to this day.


12 David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring the ark of God to me?”
13 So David did not bring the ark to himself into the city of David, but diverted it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
14 Thus the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house three months; and the LORD blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that he had.




Chapter 14


1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, with cedar logs, and masons, and carpenters, to build a house for him.


2 And David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, for his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of His people Israel.
3 And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and daughters.
4 And these are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
5 and Ibhar, Elishua, and Elpelet,
6 and Nogah, Nepheg, and Japhia,
7 and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.


8 And when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it and went out before them.
9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim.
10 Then David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You give them into my hand?” And the LORD said to him, “Go up, and I will give them into your hand.”
11 And they came up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them down there. And David said, “God has broken through my enemies by my hand like the breaking through of waters.” Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
12 And they left their gods there; and David gave the order, and they were burned with fire.


13 And the Philistines again made a raid in the valley.
14 And David again inquired of God, and God said to him, “Do not go up after them. Turn around and come upon them opposite the balsam trees.
15 And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”
16 And David did as God had commanded him, and they struck the camp of the Philistines from Gibeon to Gezer.


17 And the fame of David went out into all lands, and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.




Chapter 15


1 And David built houses for himself in the city of David. And he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
2 Then David said, “No one should carry the ark of God but the Levites, for the LORD chose them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister to Him forever.”
3 And David gathered all Israel to Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it.
4 And David assembled the sons of Aaron and the Levites:
5 of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief and his brothers, one hundred twenty;
6 of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief and his brothers, two hundred twenty;
7 of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief and his brothers, one hundred thirty;
8 of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief and his brothers, two hundred;
9 of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief and his brothers, eighty;
10 of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief and his brothers, one hundred twelve.
11 And David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,
12 and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites. Consecrate yourselves, you and your brothers, so that you may bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.
13 Because you did not carry it the first time, the LORD our God broke out against us, for we did not seek Him according to the ordinance.”


14 So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.
15 And the sons of the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD.
16 And David commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of song, lyres, harps, and cymbals, raising the voice with joy.
17 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; and from his brothers, Asaph son of Berechiah; and from the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan son of Kushaiah.1
18 And with them their brothers of the second rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphalehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.


19 The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound bronze cymbals.
20 And Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play lyres set to alamoth.
21 And Mattithiah, Eliphalehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to play harps tuned to the sheminith, to lead the singing.
22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites for the music, directed the music, for he was skillful.
23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were protecting the ark.
24 And the priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. And Obed-edom and Jehiah were protecting the ark.


25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing.
26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
27 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who carried the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the leader of the music. David also wore a linen ephod.
28 So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of horns, trumpets, cymbals, lyres and harps.
29 And it came to pass, when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out through the window and saw King David dancing and playing music, and she despised him in her heart.




Chapter 16


1 So they brought in the ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
2 When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
3 And he distributed to every man of Israel, both man and woman, a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.


4 And he appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the LORD, to invoke, to give thanks, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel:
5 Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with lyres and harps; and Asaph was to sound the cymbals,
6 and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.


7 On that day David first appointed that thanksgiving be sung to the LORD by Asaph and his brothers.
8 Give thanks to the LORD; call upon His name;
make known His deeds among the nations.
9 Sing to Him, sing praises to Him;
speak of all His wondrous works.
10 Glory in His holy name;
let the heart of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
11 Seek the LORD and His strength;
seek His face continually.
12 Remember the wonders that He has done,
His miracles, and the judgments of His mouth,
13 O offspring of Israel His servant,
sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
14 He is the LORD our God;
His judgments are in all the earth.
15 Remember His covenant forever,
the word that He commanded to a thousand generations,
16 the covenant that He made with Abraham,
and His oath to Isaac.
17 He confirmed it to Jacob as a statute,
to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
18 saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,
as the portion of your inheritance.”
19 When you were few in number,
very few, and sojourners in it,
20 and they went about from nation to nation,
from one kingdom to another people,
21 He allowed no man to oppress them;
He rebuked kings on their account,
22 saying, “Do not touch My anointed ones,
and do My prophets no harm.”
23 Sing to the LORD, all the earth!
Proclaim His salvation from day to day.
24 Declare His glory among the nations,
His marvelous deeds among all the peoples.
25 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised;
He is to be feared above all gods.
26 For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
but the LORD made the heavens.
27 Splendor and majesty are before Him;
strength and joy are in His place.
28 Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples,
ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
29 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name;
bring an offering, and come before Him!
Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness.
30 Tremble before Him, all the earth;
indeed, the world is firmly established;
it will not be moved.
31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
and let them say among the nations, “The LORD reigns!”
32 Let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
let the field exult, and all that is in it.
33 Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the LORD,
for He is coming to judge the earth.
34 Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good;
for His lovingkindness endures forever.
35 And say, “Save us, O God of our salvation,
and gather and deliver us from the nations,
that we may give thanks to Your holy name,
and glory in Your praise.
36 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
from everlasting to everlasting.”
And all the people said, “Amen,” and praised the LORD.


37 So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister regularly before the ark as each day required,
38 and also Obed-edom and his sixty-eight brothers; Obed-edom the son of Jeduthun and Hosah were to be gatekeepers.


39 And he left Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place that was at Gibeon,
40 to offer burnt offerings regularly on the altar of burnt offering morning and evening, according to all that is written in the law of the LORD that He commanded Israel.
41 And with them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks to the LORD, for His lovingkindness endures forever.
42 And with them were Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those who should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were at the gate.
43 Then all the people departed, each to his house, and David returned to bless his household.




Chapter 17


1 Now it came about, when David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under curtains.”
2 Then Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.”
3 But it came about that same night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
4 “Go and say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD: You shall not build Me a house in which to dwell.
5 For I have not dwelled in a house from the day I brought up Israel to this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from one dwelling place to another.
6 In all places where I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, “Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?”’
7 So now, this is what you will say to My servant David: ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel.
8 And I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
9 And I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and not be disturbed again, nor shall the wicked wear them down anymore as formerly,
10 even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you.
11 And it shall come about when your days are fulfilled to go to your fathers, that I will raise up your descendant after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
12 He shall build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever.
13 I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to Me. I will not take away My lovingkindness from him, as I took it from him who was before you,
14 but I will establish him in My house and in My kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.’”
15 According to all these words and according to all this vision, this is what Nathan spoke to David.


16 Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said, “Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
17 And this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God, but You have spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the rank of a man of high degree, O LORD God.
18 What more can David still say to You for honoring Your servant? For You know Your servant.
19 O LORD, for the sake of Your servant and according to Your heart, You have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things.
20 O LORD, there is none like You, and there is no God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
21 And who is like Your people Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make for Yourself a name by great and awesome deeds, by driving out nations from before Your people whom You redeemed from Egypt?
22 For You have made Your people Israel to be Your own people forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God.
23 So now, O LORD, let the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house be confirmed forever, and do as You have spoken.
24 And let Your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel;’ and the house of David Your servant will be established before You.
25 For You, O my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build a house for him; therefore Your servant has found courage to pray before You.
26 And now, O LORD, You are God, and You have promised this good thing to Your servant.
27 So now it has pleased You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You; for You, O LORD, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”




Chapter 18


1 And after this, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Gath and its surrounding villages out of Philistine control.
2 He also defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute.
3 David also struck Hadadezer king of Zobah at Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion at the Euphrates River.
4 And David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. Then David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but he kept enough of them for a hundred chariots.
5 And when the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand men of the Arameans.
6 Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.


7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
8 And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze. With it Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the bronze vessels.


9 When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck down all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
10 he sent Hadoram, his son, to King David to greet him and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him down—for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou. And with him he sent all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze.
11 These also King David dedicated to the LORD, along with the silver and gold that he carried off from all the nations: from Edom and Moab and the sons of Ammon and the Philistines and Amalek.


12 And Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
13 And he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.


14 So David reigned over all Israel, and he administered justice and righteousness for all his people.
15 And Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder.
16 And Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were priests, and Shavsha was scribe.
17 And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and the sons of David were chief officials at the king’s side.




Chapter 19


1 And it came to pass after this, that Nahash king of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.
2 And David said, “I will deal loyally with Hanun son of Nahash, because his father dealt loyally with me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And the servants of David came to Hanun in the land of the sons of Ammon to console him.
3 But the princes of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your father, that he has sent comforters to you? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?”
4 So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle at their hips and sent them away.
5 And some men went and told David about the men, and he went to meet them, for the men were greatly humiliated. And the king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards grow back, then return.”


6 And when the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maacah, and Zobah.
7 And they hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah with his people, who came and camped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon were gathered from their cities and came to battle.
8 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of mighty men.
9 And the sons of Ammon came out and drew up for battle at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
10 And Joab saw that the battle line was against him both in front and behind. So he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Arameans.
11 And the rest of the men he put under the command of Abishai, his brother, and they arrayed themselves against the sons of Ammon.
12 And he said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.
13 Be strong, and let us be courageous for our people and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good in His eyes.”
14 So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him.
15 And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, his brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
16 But when the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer leading them.
17 And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up against them. And David set the battle in array against the Arameans, and they fought with him.
18 And the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers of the Arameans, and he also killed Shophach the commander of the army.
19 And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his servants. And the Arameans would not help the sons of Ammon anymore.




Chapter 20


1 And it came to pass, at the turn of the year, at the time when kings go out to war, Joab led out the army and ravaged the land of the Ammonites and came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and overthrew it.
2 And David took the crown of their king from his head, and he found it weighed a talent of gold, and it had a precious stone in it; and it was placed on David’s head. And he brought out a great amount of spoil from the city.
3 And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and axes. Thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.


4 And after this, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, who was of the descendants of the Rephaim, and they were subdued.
5 And there was again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair struck down Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
6 And again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended from the Rephaim.
7 And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, struck him down.
8 These were descended from the Rephaim in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.




Chapter 21


1 Then Satan stood up against Israel and incited David to number Israel.
2 And David said to Joab and to the commanders of the army, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number.”
3 But Joab said, “May the LORD add to his people a hundred times as many as they are! Are they not all my lord the king’s servants? Why should my lord seek this? Why should it become a source of guilt for Israel?”
4 But the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab went out and traveled throughout all Israel, and he came back to Jerusalem.
5 And Joab gave the count of the census of the people to David. And all Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah was four hundred seventy thousand men who drew the sword.
6 But he did not number Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s command was abhorrent to Joab.


7 And this thing was evil in the sight of God, and he struck Israel.
8 Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly in doing this thing. But now, I pray, take away the guilt of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”
9 And the LORD spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,
10 “Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: I offer you three things; choose one of them, and I will do it to you.’”
11 So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: Choose for yourself:
12 either three years of famine, or three months of being swept away before your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or three days of the sword of the LORD, even pestilence in the land, with the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel. Now consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.”
13 Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercies are very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”


14 So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.
15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, the LORD saw and relented of the disaster. And he said to the destroying angel, “Enough! Now stay your hand.” And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
16 And David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
17 And David said to God, “Was it not I who commanded the numbering of the people? I am the one who has sinned and done this evil; but these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, I pray, let your hand be against me and against my father’s house, but not against your people, that they should be plagued.”
18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan




Chapter 22


1 Then David said, “This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”
2 And David commanded to gather the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, and he appointed stonecutters to hew out dressed stones to build the house of God.
3 And David prepared iron in abundance for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, and bronze in abundance beyond weighing,
4 and cedar logs without number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought cedar wood in abundance to David.


5 And David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all lands. Therefore I will make preparation for it.” So David prepared abundantly before his death.
6 Then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.
7 And David said to Solomon, “My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for the name of the LORD my God
8 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and have waged great wars. You shall not build a house for my name, for you have shed much blood on the earth before me.
9 Behold, a son will be born to you. He shall be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies. For his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.
10 He shall build a house for my name. He shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’


11 Now, my son, may the LORD be with you, so that you may succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as he has spoken concerning you.
12 Only may the LORD grant you insight and understanding and give you charge over Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
13 Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the ordinances that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not fear and do not be dismayed.
14 Now behold, with great effort I have prepared for the house of the LORD one hundred thousand talents of gold, and one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weighing, for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone, and you may add to them.
15 Moreover, you have an abundance of workmen: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and every kind of skilled craftsman in every kind of work.
16 Gold, silver, bronze, and iron—there is no limit. Arise and work! May the LORD be with you.”


17 Then David commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
18 “Is not the LORD your God with you? And has he not given you rest on every side? For he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before the LORD and before his people.
19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God. Arise and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God may be brought into the house built for the name of the LORD.”




Chapter 23


1 When David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
2 He gathered together all the leaders of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
3 The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward, and their number, by headcount, was thirty-eight thousand men.
4 Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of the LORD, six thousand were officers and judges,
5 four thousand were gatekeepers, and four thousand were to praise the LORD with the instruments which David had made for giving praise.


6 David organized them in divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
7 Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
8 The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel—three.
9 The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran—three. These were the heads of the families of Ladan.
10 And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
11 Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second. But Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were enrolled as a single family.
12 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel—four.
13 The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to be consecrated as most holy, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name forever.
14 But the sons of Moses the man of God were named among the tribe of Levi.
15 The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
16 The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.
17 The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.
18 The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.
19 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
20 The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.
21 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
22 Eleazar died and had no sons, but only daughters, and their brothers, the sons of Kish, married them.
23 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth—three.
24 These were the sons of Levi by their fathers' houses, the heads of the fathers' houses, as they were counted individually by name, from twenty years old and upward, who served in the work of the house of the LORD.


25 For David said, “The LORD, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people, and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.
26 So the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of its utensils for its service.”
27 For by the last words of David, the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and upward.
28 For their duty was to assist the sons of Aaron in the service of the house of the LORD, having charge of the courts and the chambers, the cleansing of all that is holy, and the work of the service of the house of God,
29 along with the showbread, the fine flour for the grain offering, the unleavened wafers, the baked offering, the offering mixed with oil, and all measures of quantity and size.
30 And they were to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at evening,
31 and whenever burnt offerings were offered to the LORD on Sabbaths, new moons, and feast days, according to the number required by the regulation for them, continually before the LORD.
32 Thus they were to take care of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary and attend the sons of Aaron their brothers for the service of the house of the LORD.




Chapter 24


1 These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and they had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.


3 David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their assigned duties in their service.
4 More chief men were found among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar, and they were divided accordingly. Sixteen heads of fathers’ houses from the sons of Eleazar, and eight from the sons of Ithamar.
5 They were divided by lot, one group with another, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar.
6 Shemaiah son of Nethanel, the scribe, one of the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the priests and the Levites—one father's house taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.
7 The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
9 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
17 the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
19 These were their appointments for their service, to come into the house of the LORD according to the arrangement made for them by Aaron their father, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him.


20 As for the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
21 Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.
22 Of the Izharites: Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
23 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
24 The sons of Uzziel: Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.
25 The brother of Micah was Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.
26 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Jaaziah: Beno.
27 The sons of Merari: by Jaaziah—Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
28 Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
29 Of Kish, the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.
30 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites, according to their fathers’ houses.
31 These likewise cast lots, just as their brothers the sons of Aaron did in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the priests and the Levites—the chief fathers just as the younger brothers.




Chapter 25


1 David and the commanders of the army set apart for service some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, who would prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals. The number of those who performed their service was:
2 From the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah, sons of Asaph under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied under the hand of the king.
3 From Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hand of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with the harp, giving thanks and praising the LORD.
4 From Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
5 All these were sons of Heman, the king’s seer, in the matters of God, to exalt him. God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
6 All these were under the direction of their father in the music of the house of the LORD, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, for the service of the house of God, under the direction of the king: Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.
7 And their number, with their brothers who were trained in singing to the LORD, all who were skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight.
8 They cast lots for their duties, small and great alike, teacher as well as student.


9 The first lot fell to Asaph to Joseph, the second to Gedaliah, he and his brothers and sons, twelve;
10 the third to Zaccur, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
11 the fourth to Izri, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
12 the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
13 the sixth to Bukkiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
14 the seventh to Jesharelah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
15 the eighth to Jeshaiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
16 the ninth to Mattaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
17 the tenth to Shimei, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
18 the eleventh to Azarel, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
19 the twelfth to Hashabiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
20 the thirteenth to Shubael, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
21 the fourteenth to Mattithiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;

30 the twenty-third to Mahazioth, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
31 the twenty-fourth to Romamti-ezer, his sons and his brothers, twelve.




Chapter 26


1 For the divisions of the gatekeepers: from the Korahites was Meshelemiah son of Kore, from the sons of Asaph.
2 Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,
3 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh.
4 Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth,
5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth—for God had blessed him.
6 To his son Shemaiah were born sons who ruled over their ancestral house, for they were men of ability.
7 The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers Elihu and Semachiah were also capable men.
8 All these were of the sons of Obed-edom, they and their sons and their brothers, able men with strength for the service—sixty-two from Obed-edom.
9 Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, capable men, eighteen in all.
10 Also Hosah, from the sons of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief—for though he was not the firstborn, his father appointed him chief—
11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth. All the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen.
12 These divisions of the gatekeepers, chief men, had duties like their brothers, to minister in the house of the LORD.
13 And they cast lots, small and great alike, according to their ancestral houses, for each gate.


14 The lot for the east fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots, and his lot came out for the north.
15 For Obed-edom, the south; and for his sons, the storehouse.
16 For Shuppim and Hosah, the west, by the gate of Shallecheth, on the ascending highway—guard corresponding to guard.
17 On the east, six Levites; on the north, four per day; on the south, four per day; and at the storehouse, two by two.
18 At the Parbar to the west, four at the highway and two at the Parbar.
19 These were the divisions of the gatekeepers among the sons of the Korahites and the sons of Merari.


20 And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasuries of the house of God and over the treasuries of the dedicated gifts.
21 The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonite belonging to Ladan, the heads of the ancestral houses belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli.
22 The sons of Jehieli: Zetham and Joel his brother were over the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
23 From the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites—
24 Shebuel son of Gershom, son of Moses, was chief officer over the treasuries.
25 His brothers from Eliezer: Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.
26 This Shelomith and his brothers were over all the treasuries of the dedicated gifts that King David and the heads of the ancestral houses and the commanders of the thousands and the hundreds and the officers of the army had dedicated.
27 From the spoil won in battles they dedicated these things to maintain the house of the LORD.
28 And all that Samuel the seer and Saul son of Kish and Abner son of Ner and Joab son of Zeruiah had dedicated—everything dedicated was under the care of Shelomith and his brothers.
29 From the Izharites: Chenaniah and his sons were assigned to external duties over Israel as officers and judges.
30 From the Hebronites: Hashabiah and his brothers, seventeen hundred capable men, had oversight over Israel west of the Jordan for all the work of the LORD and for the service of the king.
31 From the Hebronites: Jerijah was the chief of the Hebronites, according to their genealogies by ancestral houses. In the fortieth year of David’s reign they were sought out, and found among them were capable men at Jazer in Gilead.
32 His brothers, capable men, were two thousand seven hundred heads of ancestral houses. And King David appointed them over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh for every matter of God and matter of the king.




Chapter 27


1 Now the sons of Israel, according to their number—the heads of fathers’ houses, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served the king in all matters of the divisions that came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year—each division was twenty-four thousand.
2 Over the first division for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
3 He was a descendant of Perez and was chief of all the commanders of the army for the first month.
4 Over the division of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite, and his division, and Mikloth was the chief officer; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
5 The third commander of the army for the third month was Benaiah, son of Jehoiada the priest, as chief; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
6 This Benaiah was a mighty man of the thirty, and over the thirty; and Ammizabad his son was in charge of his division.
7 The fourth for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
8 The fifth for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
9 The sixth for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
10 The seventh for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the sons of Ephraim; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
11 The eighth for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zerahites; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
12 The ninth for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the Benjaminites; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
13 The tenth for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zerahites; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
14 The eleventh for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the sons of Ephraim; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
15 The twelfth for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.


16 Over the tribes of Israel: of the Reubenites, Eliezer the son of Zichri was chief; of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah;
17 of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel; of Aaron, Zadok;
18 of Judah, Elihu, one of David’s brothers; of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael;
19 of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah; of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of Azriel;
20 of the Ephraimites, Hoshea the son of Azaziah; of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah;
21 of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah; of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner;
22 of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the leaders of the tribes of Israel.
23 But David did not count those twenty years old and under, because the LORD had said He would multiply Israel like the stars of the heavens.
24 Joab the son of Zeruiah had begun to count them, but he did not finish, and wrath came upon Israel for it; nor was the number entered in the account of the chronicles of King David.


25 Over the king’s treasuries was Azmaveth the son of Adiel; and over the treasuries in the country, in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers was Jonathan the son of Uzziah.
26 Over those who did the work of the field for tilling the soil was Ezri the son of Chelub.
27 Over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite; over the produce of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite.
28 Over the olive trees and the sycamore trees in the Shephelah was Baal-hanan the Gederite; over the stores of oil was Joash.
29 Over the herds that grazed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite; and over the herds in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai.
30 Over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite; and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite.
31 Over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite. All these were overseers of the property which belonged to King David.


32 Also Jonathan, David’s uncle, was a counselor, a man of understanding, and a scribe; and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni attended the king’s sons.
33 Ahithophel was the king’s counselor, and Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend.
34 After Ahithophel came Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. Joab was commander of the king’s army.




Chapter 28


1 Then David assembled all the leaders of Israel—the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of the divisions that served the king, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the stewards of all the property and livestock of the king and of his sons, with the officials and the mighty men, even all the valiant men—to Jerusalem.
2 Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Hear me, my brothers and my people. I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and for the footstool of our God, and I prepared materials for building.
3 But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for My name, because you are a man of war and have shed blood.’
4 Yet the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me from all my father’s house to be king over Israel forever. For He has chosen Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah, my father’s house, and among the sons of my father He took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.
5 And of all my sons—for the LORD has given me many sons—He has chosen Solomon, my son, to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
6 And He said to me, ‘Solomon your son is the one who shall build My house and My courts, for I have chosen him to be My son, and I will be his Father.
7 I will establish his kingdom forever, if he continues strong in keeping My commandments and My ordinances, as he is doing today.’


8 Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God: observe and seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God, so that you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your sons after you forever.
9 And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve Him with a whole heart and with a willing mind; for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever.
10 Consider now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong and do it.”


11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the plan of the vestibule, its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, its inner rooms, and the room for the mercy seat;
12 and the plan of all that he had by the Spirit—for the courts of the house of the LORD, and all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of God and for the treasuries of dedicated things;
13 also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD;
14 the weight of gold for all vessels of each kind of service, the weight for all silver vessels for each kind of service,
15 the weight of the golden lampstands and their lamps, the weight of gold for each lampstand and its lamps, and the weight of silver for the silver lampstands, for each lampstand and its lamps, according to the service of each lampstand;
16 the weight of gold for each table for the showbread, and the silver for the silver tables;
17 and pure gold for the forks, the basins, and the cups; for the golden bowls and their weight, for each bowl; and for the silver bowls, for each bowl;
18 and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight, and gold for the pattern of the chariot—the cherubim that spread out their wings and cover the ark of the covenant of the LORD.


19 “All this,” said David, “the LORD made me understand in writing, by His hand upon me, all the works of this plan.”
20 And David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous and do it. Do not be afraid or dismayed, for the LORD God, even my God, is with you. He will not leave you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished.
21 And behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God are with you in every willing man who has skill for any kind of service. Also the officers and all the people will be wholly at your command.”




Chapter 29


1 Then King David said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for the palace is not for man but for the LORD God.
2 So I have provided with all my might for the house of my God—gold for the gold things, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron, and wood for the wood, onyx stones and inlaid stones, stones of antimony and variegated colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble in abundance.
3 Moreover, because I delight in the house of my God, I give my own private treasure of gold and silver for the house of my God, beyond all that I have already provided for the holy house—
4 three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings,
5 gold for the gold work and silver for the silver work, and for all the work done by the craftsmen. Who then is willing to consecrate himself today to the LORD?”


6 Then the leaders of the fathers’ houses made their freewill offerings, as did the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officers over the king’s work.
7 They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
8 And whoever possessed precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite.


9 Then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly, for with a whole heart they had offered freely to the LORD. And David the king also rejoiced greatly.
10 Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said, “Blessed are You, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.
11 Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on the earth is Yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and You are exalted as head over all.
12 Both riches and honor come from You, and You rule over all. In Your hand are power and might, and in Your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all.
13 Now therefore, our God, we give You thanks and praise Your glorious name.


14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from You, and from Your hand we have given You.
15 For we are sojourners before You and strangers, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope of remaining.
16 O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided to build You a house for Your holy name comes from Your hand, and all is Yours.
17 I know, my God, that You test the heart and take pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things, and now I have seen with joy Your people, who are present here, offering willingly to You.
18 O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the heart of Your people, and direct their hearts toward You.
19 Grant to Solomon my son a whole heart, to keep Your commandments, Your testimonies, and Your statutes, and to do all of them, and to build the palace for which I have made provision.”
20 Then David said to all the assembly, “Bless the LORD your God.” And all the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers, and bowed their heads and prostrated themselves before the LORD and before the king.
21 And the next day they offered sacrifices to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings to the LORD: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
22 And they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king a second time, and they anointed him as prince for the LORD, and Zadok as priest.


23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of David his father, and he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
24 All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, pledged allegiance to King Solomon.
25 And the LORD made Solomon exceedingly great in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him royal majesty such as had not been on any king before him in Israel.


26 Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his place.
29 Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the records of Samuel the seer and in the records of Nathan the prophet and in the records of Gad the seer,
30 with all his reign and his might and the events that befell him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the lands.﻿2 Chronicles 


Chapter 1


1 Solomon the son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.
2 And Solomon spoke to all Israel—to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ houses.
3 And Solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness, was there.
4 (But the ark of God David had brought up from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.)
5 Moreover, the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the LORD. And Solomon and the assembly sought it out.
6 And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.


7 During that night, God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask what I shall give you.”
8 And Solomon said to God, “You have shown great loyal love to David, my father, and have made me king in his place.
9 Now, O LORD God, let your promise to David my father be established, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.
10 Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this great people of yours?”


11 Then God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked for riches, possessions, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked for long life, but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may rule my people over whom I have made you king—
12 wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you ever had, nor shall any after you have the like.”


13 So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.
14 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
15 And the king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as abundant as the sycamores of the Shephelah.
16 And Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue; the king’s merchants bought them from Kue for a price.
17 They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty. And so they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram through their agents.




Chapter 2


1 Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a royal palace for himself.
2 And Solomon assigned seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry stone in the hill country, and thirty-six hundred to oversee them.


3 And Solomon sent word to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, “As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedar to build himself a house to dwell in, so deal with me.
4 Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, and to dedicate it to him, to burn before him incense of fragrant spices, and for the regular rows of bread, and for burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths and the new moons and the appointed feasts of the LORD our God, as ordained forever for Israel.
5 The house that I am about to build will be great, for our God is greater than all gods.
6 But who is able to build him a house, since heaven, even the highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I that I should build him a house, except to burn incense before him?
7 So now send me a craftsman skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with the craftsmen whom David my father provided.
8 Also send me cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting timber in Lebanon. And behold, my servants will be with your servants,
9 to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am about to build will be great and wondrous.
10 Behold, I will give to your servants, the woodcutters who cut the timber, twenty thousand cors of crushed wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.”


11 Then Huram king of Tyre answered in a letter that he sent to Solomon, “Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you king over them.”
12 Huram also said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, endowed with prudence and understanding, who will build a house for the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
13 Now I am sending a skilled man, who has understanding, Huram-abi,
14 the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre. He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your craftsmen, the craftsmen of my lord David your father.
15 Now then, let my lord send to his servants the wheat, barley, oil, and wine, as he has promised.
16 And we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you as rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem.”


17 Then Solomon counted all the foreigners who were living in the land of Israel, after the census that David his father had taken, and there were found 153,600.
18 He assigned seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry stone in the hill country, and thirty-six hundred to oversee them and to make the work go forward.




Chapter 3


1 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
2 He began to build on the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
3 Now these were the foundations Solomon laid for building the house of God: the length, in cubits according to the old standard, was sixty cubits, and the width was twenty cubits.
4 The porch that was in front of the house was twenty cubits in length, corresponding to the width of the house, and its height was one hundred twenty. He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold.
5 And the great hall he paneled with cypress and overlaid it with fine gold, and he made palm trees and chains on it.
6 He adorned the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was gold from Parvaim.
7 So he overlaid the house—the beams, the thresholds, its walls and its doors—with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls.


8 And he made the Most Holy Place. Its length, corresponding to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits. And he overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold.
9 The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
10 And in the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim of sculpted work, and they overlaid them with gold.
11 The wings of the cherubim together were twenty cubits long. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing was five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
12 And one wing of the second cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing was five cubits, touching the wing of the first cherub.
13 The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits, and they stood on their feet, and their faces were turned inward.


14 And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen, and he worked cherubim on it.
15 And he made before the house two pillars thirty-five cubits high, with a capital of five cubits on the top of each.
16 And he made chains in the inner sanctuary and placed them on the tops of the pillars, and he made one hundred pomegranates and placed them on the chains.
17 Then he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right and one on the left. He called the name of the one on the right Jachin, and the name of the one on the left Boaz.




Chapter 4


1 Then he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits in length, twenty cubits in width, and ten cubits in height.
2 And he made the Sea of cast metal, ten cubits from brim to brim, perfectly round. It was five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.
3 Under it were figures resembling oxen, encircling it all around—ten per cubit, surrounding the Sea all around. The oxen were cast in two rows when it was cast.
4 It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The Sea was set on them, and all their hindquarters were turned inward.
5 Its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held three thousand baths.
6 He also made ten basins in which to wash, and he set five on the right side and five on the left side. In them they rinsed what was used for the burnt offering, but the Sea was for the priests to wash in.
7 And he made ten golden lampstands according to the prescribed pattern, and he set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.
8 He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred basins of gold.
9 Then he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court, and he overlaid the doors with bronze.
10 And he set the Sea at the southeast corner of the house.


11 Huram also made the pots, the shovels, and the bowls. So Huram finished the work that he did for King Solomon in the house of God:
12 the two pillars, the bowls and the two capitals on the tops of the pillars, and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars,
13 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks—two rows of pomegranates for each latticework—to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.
14 He also made the stands and the basins on the stands,
15 and the one Sea and the twelve oxen underneath it.
16 The pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the utensils Huram-abi made of polished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD.


17 In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
18 Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, for the weight of the bronze could not be determined.
19 So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence,
20 the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary as prescribed,
21 the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold,
22 and the snuffers, the basins, the ladles, and the firepans, of pure gold. As for the entrance to the house, the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and the doors of the nave of the temple were of gold.




Chapter 5


1 Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and all the vessels—and he put them in the treasuries of the house of God.
2 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers’ houses of the sons of Israel, in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
3 And all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the feast that is in the seventh month.


4 And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.
5 And they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the holy vessels that were in the tent. The Levitical priests brought them up.
6 And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.
7 And the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
8 For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles.
9 And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.
10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.


11 Now when the priests came out of the Holy Place—for all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves, without regard to their divisions,
12 and all the Levitical singers—Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, their sons and their brothers—clothed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, stood east of the altar with one hundred twenty priests who were blowing trumpets.
13 And it was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the LORD. And when the song was raised, with trumpets and cymbals and other instruments, in praise to the LORD,
“For he is good,
for his loyal love endures forever,”
the house—the house of the LORD—was filled with a cloud,
14 so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.




Chapter 6


1 Then Solomon said, “The Lord has said that he would dwell in thick darkness,
2 and I have built a house for you, a place for your dwelling forever.”


3 Then the king turned toward the assembly of Israel and blessed all the congregation, and the whole assembly stood.


4 He said, “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father and with his hand has fulfilled it, saying,
5 ‘Since the day that I brought my people out of Egypt, I chose no city from among all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house for my name, nor did I choose anyone to be prince over my people Israel,
6 but I chose Jerusalem that my name might be there, and I chose David to rule my people Israel.’
7 It was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
8 But the Lord said to David my father: ‘Because it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well in having that in your heart,
9 yet you shall not build the house, but your son is the one who shall build the house for my name.’
10 So the Lord has fulfilled his word that he spoke; for I have arisen in the place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the Lord promised, and I have built the house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
11 There I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord that he made with the sons of Israel.”


12 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all Israel, spread out his hands to heaven—(Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high; he stood on it and knelt before all Israel, his hands spread to heaven)—


13 and prayed, “O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth beneath—those who keep covenant and steadfast love with their servants who walk before you in whole‑hearted devotion,
14 who have kept the promise you made with David my father, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man before me to sit on the throne of Israel, provided your sons take heed to their way, walking in my law as you walked before me.’
15 Now therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, confirm your word with your servant David my father.
16 But can God indeed dwell with humanity on earth? Surely the heavens—even the highest heavens—cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built!
17 Yet turn your attention to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O Lord, my God, to listen to the cry and the prayer your servant offers before you today.
18 May your eyes be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which you said, ‘My name shall be there,’ to listen to the prayer that your servant shall pray toward this place.
19 Hear the prayers of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this house; hear from heaven your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.”


20 “If a man sins against his neighbor and is forced to swear an oath before your altar in this house,
21 then hear from heaven and act—judge, convict the guilty by bringing his deeds upon his own head, and justify the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness.


22 When your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against you, and they return and confess your name and pray and plea before you in this house,
23 then hear from heaven, forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them back to the land you gave to their fathers.


24 If the heavens are shut and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, yet they pray toward this house and confess your name and turn from their sin when you afflict them,
25 then hear from heaven, forgive the sin of your servants and of your people Israel when you teach them the right way in which they should walk, and give rain upon your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.


26 If there is famine in the land, pestilence, blight, mildew, locust, or caterpillar; or if their enemies besiege them in their cities—whatever plague or sickness;
27 whatever prayer or plea is made by any man or by all your people Israel, each knowing the affliction of his own heart, and spreading out his hands toward this house—
28 then hear from heaven your dwelling place, forgive, and give to each man according to all his ways, for you alone know the heart of each man—
29 that they may fear you all their days and walk in your ways in the land you gave to our fathers.


30 Moreover, concerning a foreigner who is not of your people Israel but comes from a distant land on account of your name—
31 when he hears of your great name, your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm, and comes and prays toward this house,
32 then hear from heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and know that this house I have built is called by your name.


33 If your people go out to battle against their enemies, wherever you send them, and they pray to the Lord toward the city you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,
34 then hear from heaven their prayer and supplication, and uphold their cause.


35 If they sin against you—for there is no man who does not sin—and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to a land far or near,
36 yet if they return to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their exile, saying, ‘We have sinned, we have acted wickedly,’
37 and return to you with whole‑hearted devotion, in the land of their exile, toward the land you gave to our fathers, to the city you chose, and to the house I have built for your name,
38 then hear from heaven, uphold their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.


39 Now, my God, let your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place.


40 Now therefore arise, O Lord God, and enter your resting place, you and the ark of your strength; may your priests be clothed with salvation and your faithful ones rejoice in goodness.


41 O Lord God, do not turn away the face of your anointed; remember your steadfast love for your servant David.




Chapter 7


1 When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the house.
2 The priests were not able to enter the house of the LORD because the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.
3 When all the sons of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement, worshiped, and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, “For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever.”


4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
5 King Solomon offered as a sacrifice twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
6 The priests stood at their posts, and the Levites also with the instruments for the songs of the LORD that King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD—“for his steadfast love endures forever”—whenever David offered praise by their hand. The priests blew trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.


7 Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that Solomon had made was not able to contain the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat.


8 At that time Solomon held the feast for seven days, and all Israel with him—a very great assembly from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt.
9 On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they had kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days.
10 On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the good that the LORD had done for David and for Solomon and for his people Israel.


11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king’s house, and all that Solomon had planned to do in the house of the LORD and in his own house, he accomplished successfully.


12 Then the LORD appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, “I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.
13 When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people,
14 if my people who are called by my name humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.
15 Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place.
16 For now I have chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there always.


17 As for you, if you walk before me as David your father walked, doing all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my judgments,
18 then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man to rule in Israel.’


19 But if you turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them,
20 then I will uproot them from my land that I have given them, and this house that I have sanctified for my name I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all the nations.
21 And this house, which was exalted—everyone passing by it will be appalled and will say, ‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?’
22 Then they will say, ‘Because they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, worshiping them and serving them—therefore he has brought all this disaster upon them.’”




Chapter 8


1 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house,
2 that Solomon rebuilt the cities that Huram had given to him, and settled the sons of Israel there.


3 And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and prevailed against it.
4 He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities that he built in Hamath.
5 He also built upper Beth-horon and lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,
6 and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities for the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion.


7 All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel—
8 from their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel had not destroyed—Solomon made forced laborers to this day.
9 But of the sons of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were men of war and his chief officers and captains and commanders of his chariots and his horsemen.
10 And these were the chief officers of King Solomon: two hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people.


11 Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy.”


12 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD that he had built before the porch,
13 as the duty of each day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the three annual appointed feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths.


14 And according to the ordinance of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their duties of praise and ministry before the priests, as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers in their divisions at each gate—for so David the man of God had commanded.
15 And they did not depart from the king’s command to the priests and Levites in any matter, or concerning the treasuries.


16 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared from the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.


17 Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the shore of the sea in the land of Edom.
18 And Huram sent him ships by the hand of his servants, and servants knowledgeable of the sea. And they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought it to King Solomon.




Chapter 9


1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to test Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices and gold in abundance and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was on her heart.
2 And Solomon answered all her questions. There was nothing hidden from Solomon that he could not explain to her.
3 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
4 and the food of his table, and the seating of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her.


5 And she said to the king, “The report was true that I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom,
6 but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And yet, half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me; you exceed the report that I heard.
7 Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom.
8 Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you to set you on His throne as king for the LORD your God! Because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever, He made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.”


9 And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones. There were no such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
10 And the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought algum trees and precious stones.
11 And the king made from the algum trees steps for the house of the LORD and for the king’s house, and lyres and harps for the singers. None like these had been seen before in the land of Judah.
12 And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked, besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went back to her own land, she and her servants.


13 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
14 besides what was brought by the merchants and traders. And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.


15 And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold—six hundred shekels of beaten gold went into each large shield.
16 And he made three hundred small shields of beaten gold—three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.


17 And the king made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.
18 The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to the throne. On each side of the seat were armrests, and two lions stood beside the armrests,
19 and twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps. Nothing like it was made for any kingdom.


20 All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.
21 For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram. Every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.


22 So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his heart.
24 Each one brought his gift, articles of silver and articles of gold, and garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules—so much year by year.


25 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
26 And he ruled over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt.
27 And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore trees that are in the Shephelah.
28 And horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.


29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from beginning to end, are they not written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
30 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
31 And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 10


1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard the news—for he was in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon—that Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
3 And they sent and called him. Then Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
4 “Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore, lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke that your father put on us, and we will serve you.”
5 And he said to them, “Return to me in three days.” So the people departed.


6 Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he was still alive, saying, “What counsel do you give me to answer this people?”
7 And they spoke to him, saying, “If you will be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever.”
8 But he forsook the counsel that the old men had given him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.
9 And he said to them, “What advice do you give, that we may answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put on us’?”
10 And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us.’ Thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs.
11 And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”


12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, “Return to me on the third day.”
13 And the king answered them harshly, and King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men.
14 And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”
15 So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of events from God, that the LORD might fulfill His word, which He spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.


16 And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying,
“What portion do we have in David?
We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.
Each man to your tents, O Israel!
Now look to your own house, O David.”
So all Israel went to their tents.
17 But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.


18 Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the forced labor, but the sons of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
19 So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.




Chapter 11


1 And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors, to fight against Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.
2 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
3 “Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
4 ‘Thus says the LORD: You shall not go up or fight against your brothers. Return each man to his house, for I caused this to happen.’” So they listened to the words of the LORD and returned from going against Jeroboam.


5 And Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built cities for defense in Judah.
6 He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
7 Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,
8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.
11 And he strengthened the fortresses and put commanders in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine.
12 And in every city he put shields and spears and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin.


13 And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel presented themselves to him from all their territory.
14 For the Levites left their common lands and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had cast them out from serving as priests to the LORD.
15 And he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat demons and for the calves that he had made.
16 And those who had set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came after them from all the tribes of Israel to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and upheld Rehoboam the son of Solomon for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.


18 And Rehoboam took as a wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse.
19 And she bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
20 And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
21 And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines (for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters).
22 And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief, prince among his brothers, for he intended to make him king.
23 And he dealt wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the territories of Judah and Benjamin, to all the fortified cities, and he gave them abundant provisions and sought many wives for them.




Chapter 12


1 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
2 And, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
3 with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him out of Egypt—Lubim, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians.
4 And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.


5 Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says the LORD: You have forsaken Me, so I also have forsaken you into the hand of Shishak.”
6 Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The LORD is righteous.”
7 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
8 Nevertheless, they shall be his servants, so that they may learn the difference between serving Me and serving the kingdoms of the nations.”


9 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house. He took everything. He also took away the shields of gold that Solomon had made.
10 And King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard who kept watch at the entrance of the king’s house.
11 And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards came and carried them, and afterward returned them to the guardroom.
12 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to destroy him completely. And after that, conditions in Judah were good.


13 So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite.
14 And he did evil, because he did not set his heart to seek the LORD.


15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer, according to the genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
16 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, and Abijah his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 13


1 In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah.
2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
3 And Abijah went out to battle with an army of valiant warriors, four hundred thousand chosen men. And Jeroboam drew up in battle array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, mighty warriors.


4 Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:
5 Do you not know that the LORD, the God of Israel, gave the kingship over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt?
6 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord,
7 and worthless men, scoundrels, gathered around him and defied Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and irresolute and could not withstand them.


8 “And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David, because you are a great multitude and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods.
9 Have you not driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests like the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to ordain himself with a young bull and seven rams becomes a priest of what are not gods.
10 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken Him. We have priests ministering to the LORD who are sons of Aaron, and Levites for their service.
11 They offer to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt offerings and incense of sweet spices, and they set the rows of bread on the pure table and care for the golden lampstand, that its lamps may burn every evening. For we keep the charge of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken Him.
12 Behold, God is with us at our head, and His priests have the trumpets of alarm to sound against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you will not succeed.”


13 But Jeroboam had set an ambush to come around behind them, so that they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
14 And when Judah turned around, behold, they were attacked in front and rear. Then they cried to the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets.
15 And the men of Judah raised a shout. And when the men of Judah shouted, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
16 And the sons of Israel fled before Judah, and God gave them into their hand.
17 And Abijah and his people struck them with great force, so that there fell slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
18 Thus the sons of Israel were subdued at that time, and the sons of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers.


19 And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him—Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages.
20 And Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah. And the LORD struck him, and he died.
21 But Abijah grew strong and took fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.


22 Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and his words, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.




Chapter 14


1 And Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land had rest for ten years.


2 And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
3 He removed the foreign altars and the high places and broke down the pillars and cut down the Asherim.
4 And he commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandment.
5 He also removed from all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense altars. And the kingdom had rest under him.


6 He built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest. He had no war in those years, because the LORD had given him peace.
7 And he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours because we have sought the LORD our God. We have sought Him, and He has given us peace on every side.” So they built and prospered.


8 And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who bore shields and spears, and two hundred eighty thousand from Benjamin who carried shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor.


9 And Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came as far as Mareshah.
10 And Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up for battle in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
11 And Asa cried to the LORD his God, saying, “O LORD, there is none like You to help between the mighty and the powerless. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on You, and in Your name we have come against this multitude. O LORD, You are our God; let not man prevail against You.”
12 So the LORD struck the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.
13 And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and the Ethiopians fell until none remained alive, for they were broken before the LORD and His army. And they carried away very much spoil.
14 And they struck all the cities around Gerar, for the terror of the LORD was upon them. They plundered all the cities, for there was much spoil in them.
15 And they also struck the tents of those who had livestock and carried away sheep in abundance and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.




Chapter 15


1 Now the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded.
2 And he went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The LORD is with you while you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.
3 For many days Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without law,
4 but when in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought Him, He was found by them.
5 In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, but great disturbances were on all the inhabitants of the lands.
6 They were broken in pieces, nation against nation and city against city, for God troubled them with every kind of distress.
7 But you, be strong and do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded.”


8 And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage and removed the abominations from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was before the vestibule of the LORD.


9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who dwelt with them, for great numbers had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
10 They gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
11 And they sacrificed to the LORD on that day from the spoil that they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
12 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul,
13 and that whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
14 And they swore to the LORD with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with horns.
15 And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and had sought Him with all their desire, and He was found by them, and the LORD gave them rest all around.


16 Even Maacah, the mother of King Asa, he removed from being queen mother because she had made an abominable image for Asherah. And Asa cut down her image, crushed it, and burned it at the brook Kidron.
17 But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless, Asa’s heart was wholly true all his days.
18 And he brought into the house of God the sacred gifts of his father and his own sacred gifts—silver and gold and vessels.


19 And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.




Chapter 16


1 In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah, to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah.
2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the king’s house, and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,
3 “There is a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, so that he may withdraw from me.”
4 And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
5 And when Baasha heard of it, he ceased building Ramah and stopped his work.
6 Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.


7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, “Because you relied on the king of Syria and did not rely on the LORD your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand.
8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a vast army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD, He gave them into your hand.
9 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is fully His. You have done foolishly in this; from now on you will have wars.”
10 Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the prison house, for he was enraged at him for this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time.


11 Now the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
12 And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa became diseased in his feet, and his disease was severe. Yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but only the physicians.
13 And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign.
14 And they buried him in the tomb that he had cut for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier filled with various kinds of spices blended by the perfumer’s art, and they made a very great fire in his honor.




Chapter 17


1 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and he strengthened himself against Israel.
2 And he placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured.


3 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baals,
4 but sought the God of his father and walked in His commandments, and not according to the practices of Israel.
5 Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.
6 And his heart was courageous in the ways of the LORD. Moreover, he removed the high places and the Asherim from Judah.


7 In the third year of his reign he sent his officials—Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah—to teach in the cities of Judah,
8 and with them the Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah—and with these, the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
9 And they taught in Judah, having with them the Book of the Law of the LORD. They went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.


10 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, and they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.
11 And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver as tribute, and the Arabians also brought him flocks—seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.
12 So Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater, and he built in Judah fortresses and store cities.
13 And he had large supplies in the cities of Judah. He also had soldiers, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.


14 This was their muster according to their fathers’ houses: Of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, with three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;
15 and next to him Jehohanan the commander, with two hundred eighty thousand;
16 and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the LORD, with two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
17 Of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, with two hundred thousand men armed with bow and shield;
18 and next to him Jehozabad, with one hundred eighty thousand armed for war.
19 These were in the service of the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.




Chapter 18


1 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and he allied himself by marriage with Ahab.
2 And after some years he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab slaughtered sheep and oxen in abundance for him and for the people who were with him, and urged him to go up against Ramoth-gilead.
3 And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?” And he answered him, “I am as you are, my people as your people. We will be with you in the war.”


4 Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire today for the word of the LORD.”
5 And the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?” And they said, “Go up, for God will give it into the hand of the king.”
6 But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of him?”
7 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil.” And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say so.”
8 Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.”


9 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria. And all the prophets were prophesying before them.
10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said, “Thus says the LORD: With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.”
11 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph, and the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”


12 And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Let your word be like one of theirs, and speak favorably.”
13 But Micaiah said, “As the LORD lives, what my God says, that I will speak.”


14 And when he came to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?” And he said, “Go up and triumph; they shall be given into your hand.”
15 But the king said to him, “How many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?”
16 Then he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd. And the LORD said, ‘These have no master; let each return to his house in peace.’”
17 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not say to you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”


18 And Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left.
19 And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one said one thing, and another said another.
20 Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, ‘I will entice him.’ And the LORD said to him, ‘By what means?’
21 And he said, ‘I will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And He said, ‘You are to entice him, and you shall succeed. Go out and do so.’
22 Now therefore, look how the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; the LORD has declared disaster concerning you.”


23 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?”
24 And Micaiah said, “You shall see on that day when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.”
25 And the king of Israel said, “Seize Micaiah and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son,
26 and say, ‘Thus says the king: Put this man in prison and feed him meager rations of bread and water until I return in peace.’”
27 And Micaiah said, “If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.” And he said, “Listen, all you people!”


28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
29 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.” And the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, “Do not fight with anyone small or great, but only with the king of Israel.”
31 And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel.” So they turned to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him.
32 For when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.


33 But a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate. So he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.”
34 And the battle continued that day, and the king of Israel was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening. And at sunset he died.




Chapter 19


1 And Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned in peace to his house in Jerusalem.
2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this, wrath has come upon you from before the LORD.
3 Nevertheless, some good is found in you, for you have removed the Asherahs from the land and have set your heart to seek God.”


4 And Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people, from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
5 He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
6 and said to the judges, “Consider what you do, for you judge not for man but for the LORD. He is with you in giving judgment.
7 Now then, let the fear of the LORD be upon you. Be careful what you do, for there is no injustice with the LORD our God, nor partiality or taking bribes.”


8 Moreover, in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed certain Levites and priests and heads of families of Israel to give judgment for the LORD and to settle disputes. They lived in Jerusalem,
9 and he commanded them, saying, “You shall act in the fear of the LORD, in faithfulness, and with a whole heart.
10 Whenever a case comes to you from your brothers who live in their cities, concerning bloodshed, law or commandment, statutes or rules, then you shall warn them, that they may not incur guilt before the LORD and wrath may not come upon you and your brothers. Thus you shall do, and you will not incur guilt.
11 And also, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the governor of the house of Judah, in all the king’s matters, and the Levites shall serve you as officers. Deal courageously, and may the LORD be with the upright.”




Chapter 20


1 After this, the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon, and with them some of the Meunites, came against Jehoshaphat for battle.
2 And messengers came and told Jehoshaphat, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Aram; and they are in Hazazon-tamar” (that is, En-gedi).
3 Then Jehoshaphat was afraid and set his face to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
4 And Judah gathered to seek help from the LORD; indeed, they came from all the cities of Judah to seek the LORD.


5 Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the LORD before the new court,
6 and said, “O LORD, God of our fathers, are You not God in heaven? Do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations? In Your hand are power and might, so that no one is able to withstand You.
7 Did You not, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham Your friend?
8 And they have lived in it and have built for You in it a sanctuary for Your name, saying,
9 ‘If disaster comes upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before You—for Your name is in this house—and cry out to You in our distress, and You will hear and save.’


10 And now, see how the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom You would not allow Israel to invade when they came from the land of Egypt, and so they turned away from them and did not destroy them—
11 They are rewarding us by coming to drive us out of Your possession, which You have given us to inherit.
12 O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us, nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are on You.”


13 And all Judah was standing before the LORD, with their infants, their wives, and their children.


14 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.
15 And he said, “Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat. Thus says the LORD to you: Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours but God’s.
16 Tomorrow go down against them. They will come up by the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley, east of the wilderness of Jeruel.
17 You will not need to fight in this battle. Take your stand, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, and the LORD will be with you.”


18 Then Jehoshaphat bowed his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the LORD, worshiping the LORD.
19 And the Levites, of the sons of the Kohathites and the sons of the Korahites, stood up to praise the LORD, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice.


20 And they rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. And as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Put your trust in the LORD your God and you will be established; put your trust in His prophets and you will succeed.”
21 And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who sang to the LORD and those who praised Him in holy attire, as they went out before the army, saying, “Give thanks to the LORD, for His steadfast love endures forever.”


22 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah, so that they were struck down.
23 For the sons of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they all helped to destroy one another.


24 And when Judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude, and saw that they were dead bodies fallen to the ground; none had escaped.
25 When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found among them goods, garments, and precious things in abundance, which they took for themselves more than they could carry. And they were gathering the spoil for three days—it was so much.


26 On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, for there they blessed the LORD. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Beracah to this day.
27 Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned, with Jehoshaphat at their head, to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies.
28 And they came to Jerusalem with harps and lyres and trumpets to the house of the LORD.


29 And the fear of God was upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
30 So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God gave him rest all around.


31 Now Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
32 And he walked in the way of Asa his father and did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD.
33 However, the high places were not removed; the people had not fully directed their hearts to the God of their fathers.


34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, they are written in the chronicles of Jehu the son of Hanani, which are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel.


35 After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted wickedly.
36 He joined with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
37 But Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have joined with Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy what you have made.” And the ships were wrecked and were not able to go to Tarshish.




Chapter 21


1 Then Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his son reigned in his place.
2 And he had brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
3 Their father gave them great gifts of silver, gold, and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah, but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram, for he was the firstborn.


4 Now when Jehoram had taken over the kingdom of his father and established himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel.
5 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done—for the daughter of Ahab was his wife—and he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
7 Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.


8 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah and set up a king of their own.
9 Then Jehoram went out with his commanders and all his chariots. And he rose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots.
10 So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah also revolted at that time from under his hand, because he had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers.


11 Moreover, he made high places in the mountains of Judah and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem into unfaithfulness and caused Judah to go astray.


12 Then a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father, ‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father or in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
13 but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel and have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, as the house of Ahab played the harlot, and also have killed your brothers, those of your father’s house who were better than you,
14 therefore, the LORD will strike your people with a great blow—your sons, your wives, and all your possessions—
15 and you yourself will suffer a severe illness, an illness of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the disease, day by day.’”


16 And the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians.
17 And they came up into Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, and also his sons and his wives, so that not a son was left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.


18 And after all this the LORD struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
19 And in the course of time, at the end of two years, his bowels came out because of his disease, and he died in great agony. And his people made no fire in his honor, like the fires made for his fathers.


20 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. And he departed with no one's regret. And they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.




Chapter 22


1 Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the raiders who came with the Arabs into the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
2 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri.
3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.
4 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab, for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.
5 He also followed their counsel and went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram.


6 So he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
7 But it was from God that the downfall of Ahaziah came through his going to Joram. For when he came, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
8 And when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who were attending Ahaziah, and he killed them.
9 Then he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him while he was hiding in Samaria. They brought him to Jehu and put him to death, and they buried him, for they said, “He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.” So the house of Ahaziah had no one left with strength to rule the kingdom.


10 Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she rose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah.
11 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being put to death, and placed him and his nurse in a bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she did not put him to death.
12 And he was hidden with them in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.




Chapter 23


1 In the seventh year, Jehoiada strengthened himself and made a covenant with the commanders of hundreds: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri.
2 They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
3 And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And Jehoiada said to them, “Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the LORD said concerning the sons of David.
4 This is the thing that you shall do: one third of you, of the priests and Levites who enter on the Sabbath, shall be gatekeepers,
5 and one third shall be at the king’s house, and one third at the Gate of the Foundation. And all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.
6 But let no one enter the house of the LORD except the priests and the ministering Levites; they may enter, for they are holy, but all the people shall keep the instructions of the LORD.
7 The Levites shall surround the king, each man with his weapons in his hand. Whoever enters the house is to be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes.”


8 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. They each took his men, those who came on duty on the Sabbath, with those who went off duty on the Sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the divisions.
9 And Jehoiada the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and large and small shields that had been King David’s, which were in the house of God.
10 And he set all the people, each man with his weapon in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house, to guard the king on every side.
11 Then they brought out the king’s son, and put the crown on him and administered him the oath, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, “Long live the king!”


12 When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she went to the people in the house of the LORD.
13 And she looked, and saw that the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and the singers with musical instruments were leading the praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, “Treason! Treason!”
14 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the commanders of hundreds who were set over the army and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks, and put to death with the sword anyone who follows her.” For the priest said, “Do not put her to death in the house of the LORD.”
15 So they laid hands on her, and when she came to the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king’s house, they put her to death there.


16 And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king, that they should be the LORD’s people.
17 Then all the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down. They broke in pieces his altars and his images, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
18 And Jehoiada put the offices of the house of the LORD into the hands of the Levitical priests, whom David had assigned over the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing according to the order of David.
19 He stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD so that no one who was unclean in any respect should enter.


20 And he took the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of the LORD. And they came through the upper gate to the king’s house and set the king on the royal throne.
21 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet, after Athaliah had been put to death with the sword.




Chapter 24


1 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
2 Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
3 Jehoiada took for him two wives, and he fathered sons and daughters.


4 After this Joash set his heart on repairing the house of the LORD.
5 He gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the house of your God annually, and see to it quickly.” But the Levites did not act quickly.
6 So the king summoned Jehoiada the high priest and said to him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and the congregation of Israel for the tent of the testimony?”
7 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, broke into the house of God and even used all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD for the Baals.


8 So the king commanded, and they made a chest and set it outside the gate of the house of the LORD.
9 And proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in for the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.
10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought their contributions and dropped them into the chest until it was full.
11 Whenever the chest was brought to the king's officers by the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest and took it and returned it to its place. They did this day after day, and collected money in abundance.
12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the LORD. And they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the LORD.
13 So those doing the work labored, and the repairs progressed in their hands, and they restored the house of God to its original condition and strengthened it.
14 When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made utensils for the house of the LORD—utensils for the service and for the burnt offerings, and dishes and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.


15 But Jehoiada grew old and full of days, and he died; he was a hundred and thirty years old at his death.
16 They buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel and for God and his house.


17 After the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them.
18 And they abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols. So wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs.
19 Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to the LORD. These testified against them, but they would not listen.


20 Then the Spirit of God entered Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, and he stood above the people and said to them, “Thus says God, Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.”
21 But they conspired against him, and by command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the LORD.
22 Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness that Jehoiada, Zechariah’s father, had shown him, but killed his son. And as he was dying, he said, “May the LORD see and avenge!”


23 At the turn of the year, the army of the Syrians came up against Joash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.
24 Though the army of the Syrians had come with a small company of men, the LORD delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment on Joash.
25 When they had departed from him, leaving him severely wounded, his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.


26 These are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
27 Now concerning his sons and the many oracles about him and the rebuilding of the house of God, see how they are written in the Chronicles of the Book of the Kings. Then, Amaziah his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 25


1 Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
2 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not with a whole heart.


3 As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his hand, he struck down his servants who had assassinated the king, his father.
4 But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, “Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers, but each shall die for his own sin.”


5 Then Amaziah assembled Judah and set them by clans under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He mustered those twenty years old and upward, and found that they were three hundred thousand choice men, fit for war, able to handle spear and shield.
6 He also hired a hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
7 But a man of God came to him and said, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel, with all these Ephraimites.
8 But if you do go with them, do it and be strong for the battle—for God will make you stumble before the enemy, for God has power to help or to make one stumble.”
9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do about the hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel?” The man of God answered, “The LORD is able to give you much more than this.”
10 So Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim, sending them home. And they became very angry with Judah and returned home in fierce anger.


11 But Amaziah took courage and led out his people and went to the Valley of Salt and struck down ten thousand men of Seir.
12 The men of Judah captured another ten thousand alive and took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down from the top of the rock, and they were all dashed to pieces.
13 But the men of the army whom Amaziah had sent back, not allowing them to go with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down three thousand people in them and took much spoil.


14 After Amaziah came from striking down the Edomites, he brought the gods of the men of Seir and set them up as his gods and worshiped them and made offerings to them.
15 Therefore the LORD was angry with Amaziah and sent to him a prophet, who said to him, “Why have you sought the gods of a people who did not deliver their own people from your hand?”
16 But as he was speaking, the king said to him, “Have we made you a counselor to the king? Stop! Why should you be struck down?” So the prophet stopped, but said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”


17 Then, Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us look one another in the face.”
18 But Joash, king of Israel, replied to Amaziah, king of Judah, “A thistle in Lebanon sent to a cedar of Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son for a wife,’ and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.
19 You say, ‘See, I have struck down Edom,’ and your heart has lifted you up in boastfulness. Stay at home. Why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?”
20 But Amaziah would not listen, for it was of God, in order that he might give them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought the gods of Edom.
21 So Joash, king of Israel, went up, and he and Amaziah, king of Judah, faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
22 And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
23 And Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits.
24 And he seized all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of God in the care of Obed-edom. He also seized the treasuries of the king's house, took hostages, and returned to Samaria.


25 Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?
27 From the time when he turned away from the LORD, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there.
28 And they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of David.




Chapter 26


1 And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
2 He built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers.
3 Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
4 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
5 He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. And as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper.


6 He went out and made war against the Philistines and broke through the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod. And he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and among the Philistines.
7 God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabians who lived in Gur-baal and against the Meunites.
8 The Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong.


9 Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the Angle, and fortified them.
10 And he built towers in the wilderness and hewed out many cisterns, for he had large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the plain. He had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.
11 Moreover, Uzziah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according to the numbers in the muster made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's commanders.
12 The whole number of the heads of fathers' houses of mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred.
13 Under their command was an army of three hundred seven thousand five hundred, who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
14 And Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging.
15 In Jerusalem he made engines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.


16 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction. For he was unfaithful to the LORD his God and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.
17 But Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty priests of the LORD who were men of valor,
18 and they confronted King Uzziah and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have done wrong, and it will bring you no honor from the LORD God.”
19 Then Uzziah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and when he became angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the LORD, by the altar of incense.
20 And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and saw that he was leprous in his forehead. And they rushed him out quickly, and he himself hurried to go out, because the LORD had struck him.


21 And King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death, and he lived in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the LORD. And Jotham, his son, was over the king’s household, governing the people of the land.
22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote down.
23 And Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the burial field that belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” And Jotham, his son, reigned in his place.




Chapter 27


1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
2 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done—except he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still acted corruptly.


3 He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD, and he did much building on the wall of Ophel.
4 Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.
5 He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. That year the Ammonites gave him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same in the second and third years.


6 So Jotham grew strong, because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.
7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, see how they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
8 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
9 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Ahaz his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 28


1 Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as David his father had done.
2 Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even made molten images for the Baals.
3 He burned incense in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom and burned his sons in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the sons of Israel.
4 He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.


5 Therefore the LORD his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, who struck him and carried away a great number of his people as captives and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with a great slaughter.
6 For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah a hundred twenty thousand in one day—all valiant men—because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.
7 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the officer over the palace, and Elkanah the second to the king.
8 And the sons of Israel took captive two hundred thousand of their kinsmen, women, sons, and daughters. They also took a great amount of spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samaria.


9 But a prophet of the LORD was there, named Oded, and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria and said to them, “Because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand, but you have slaughtered them in a rage that has reached up to heaven.
10 And now you intend to subjugate the men of Judah and Jerusalem as your male and female slaves. But are you not also guilty before the LORD your God?
11 Now hear me, and send back the captives you have taken from your brothers, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.”


12 Then some of the heads of the sons of Ephraim—Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai—stood up against those coming from the war,
13 and said to them, “You shall not bring the captives in here, for you propose to bring guilt upon us before the LORD by adding to our sins and to our guilt, for our guilt is already great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.”
14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the leaders and all the assembly.
15 And the men who were mentioned by name rose and took the captives, and with the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them. They clothed them, gave them sandals, food and drink, and anointed them, and carrying all the feeble among them on donkeys, they brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria.


16 At that time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help.
17 For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah and carried away captives.
18 The Philistines also had made raids on the cities in the lowland and the Negev of Judah and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages, and they settled there.
19 For the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had caused a lack of restraint in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the LORD.
20 So Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him.
21 For Ahaz took a portion from the house of the LORD, from the palace of the king, and from the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria, but it did not help him.


22 In the time of his distress he became even more unfaithful to the LORD—this same King Ahaz.
23 For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, who had struck him, and said, “Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them so that they may help me.” But they were his downfall and the downfall of all Israel.
24 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut them to pieces, and he shut the doors of the house of the LORD and made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
25 In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and he provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers, to anger.
26 Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
27 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 29


1 Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah.
2 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.


3 In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them.
4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them into the square on the east.
5 Then he said to them, “Listen to me, O Levites! Now sanctify yourselves and sanctify the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers, and carry the filthiness out from the holy place.
6 For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him and turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD, and turned their backs.
7 They also shut the doors of the porch and extinguished the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.
8 Therefore the wrath of the LORD has been upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he has made them an object of horror, of astonishment, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes.
9 For our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.


10 Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, that his burning anger may turn away from us.
11 My sons, do not now be negligent, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before him, to minister to him, and to be his ministers and burn offerings to him.”


12 Then the Levites arose: Mahath son of Amasai, and Joel son of Azariah, from the sons of the Kohathites; and from the sons of Merari, Kish son of Abdi, and Azariah son of Jehallelel; and from the Gershonites, Joah son of Zimmah, and Eden son of Joah;
13 and from the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; and from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
14 and from the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
15 And they gathered their brothers and sanctified themselves, and went in according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.
16 So the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and they brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. Then the Levites received it to carry it out to the Kidron Valley.
17 Now they began to clean on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of the LORD. Then they cleansed the house of the LORD for eight more days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.


18 Then they went to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, and the table of showbread with all its vessels.
19 Moreover, all the vessels which King Ahaz in his reign cast aside in his unfaithfulness, we have prepared and sanctified; and they are now before the altar of the LORD.”


20 Then King Hezekiah arose early and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.
21 And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. And he commanded the sons of Aaron the priests to offer them on the altar of the LORD.
22 So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar; they slaughtered the lambs also and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
23 Then they brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.
24 The priests slaughtered them and purged their blood on the altar to make atonement for all Israel, for the king commanded the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.


25 He then stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with harps, and with lyres, according to the commandment of David and of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was from the LORD through his prophets.
26 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
27 Then Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt offering on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD also began with the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel.
28 And all the assembly bowed down, while the singers sang and the trumpets sounded—all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
29 And when the burnt offering was finished, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and worshiped.
30 Moreover, King Hezekiah and the rulers ordered the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed down and worshiped.


31 Then Hezekiah said, “Now you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD. Come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.” And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all who were willing of heart brought burnt offerings.
32 And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs—all these as a burnt offering to the LORD.
33 And the consecrated things were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.
34 But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings. Therefore their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was finished and until the priests had sanctified themselves, for the Levites were more upright of heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
35 There were also many burnt offerings with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.
36 Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God had prepared for the people, for the thing came about suddenly.




Chapter 30


1 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem to keep the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel.
2 For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the Passover in the second month,
3 for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people been gathered to Jerusalem.
4 And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and in the eyes of all the assembly.
5 So they established a decree to pass throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem; for they had not done it in great numbers as it was written.


6 And the couriers went with the letters from the hand of the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, according to the commandment of the king, saying, “Sons of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant who escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
7 And do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their fathers, so that he made them an object of horror, as you see.
8 Now do not stiffen your necks as your fathers did, but yield yourselves to the LORD and come to his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve the LORD your God, that his burning anger may turn away from you.
9 For if you return to the LORD, your brothers and your sons will find compassion before those who led them captive and will return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and compassionate, and he will not turn his face away from you if you return to him.”


10 So the couriers passed from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them.
11 Nevertheless, some men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
12 The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the LORD.


13 Now many men were gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
14 And they arose and removed the altars which were in Jerusalem, and they also removed all the incense altars and cast them into the Kidron Valley.
15 Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed, so they sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.
16 And they stood in their place according to their custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood from the hand of the Levites.
17 For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to the LORD.
18 For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it was written. For Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the good LORD pardon everyone
19 who sets his heart to seek God, the LORD, the God of his fathers, though not according to the purification of the sanctuary.”
20 And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.


21 And the sons of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness. And the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments to the LORD.
22 Then Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good understanding of the service of the LORD. So they ate the appointed feast seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers.


23 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep the feast another seven days, and they kept it seven more days with gladness.
24 For Hezekiah king of Judah gave the assembly one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the princes gave the assembly one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. And a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
25 And all the assembly of Judah rejoiced, with the priests and the Levites and all the assembly that came from Israel, and the sojourners who came from the land of Israel, and those who lived in Judah.
26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there had not been anything like this in Jerusalem.
27 Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard and their prayer came to his holy dwelling place, to heaven.




Chapter 31


1 Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke in pieces the pillars, cut down the Asherim, and pulled down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the sons of Israel returned, each man to his possession in their cities.


2 And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites by their divisions, each man according to his service, the priests and the Levites for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD.
3 The contribution of the king from his own possessions was for the burnt offerings, the burnt offerings of morning and evening, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.
4 Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might be strong in the law of the LORD.


5 And as soon as the command spread abroad, the sons of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.
6 And the sons of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of the dedicated things which had been consecrated to the LORD their God, and they laid them in heaps.
7 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
8 When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and his people Israel.
9 Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.


10 And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, “Since they began to bring the contributions into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and have plenty left, for the LORD has blessed his people, and this great abundance is left over.”
11 Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD, and they prepared them.
12 And they faithfully brought in the contributions, the tithes, and the dedicated things; and Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them, and Shimei his brother was second.
13 And Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the chief officer of the house of God.
14 And Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the contributions of the LORD and the most holy things.


15 Under his authority were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, to distribute faithfully to their brothers by divisions, to great and small alike.
16 Apart from those males who were recorded by genealogy, from three years old and upward, they distributed to everyone who entered the house of the LORD for his daily portion, for their service in their duties according to their divisions.
17 The genealogy of the priests was recorded according to their fathers’ households, as was also that of the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their duties by their divisions.
18 They were enrolled with all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, the whole assembly, for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness.
19 And for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men who were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone who was recorded by genealogy among the Levites.


20 Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and faithful before the LORD his God.
21 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law and in the commandment, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart and prospered.




Chapter 32


1 After these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered Judah and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to break through them for himself.
2 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to make war on Jerusalem,
3 he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop up the water of the springs which were outside the city, and they helped him.
4 So many people were gathered and they stopped up all the springs and the brook which flowed through the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?”
5 And he strengthened himself and rebuilt all the wall that had been broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and built another wall outside, and strengthened the Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.
6 He appointed military commanders over the people and gathered them to him in the square at the city gate, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,


7 “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid nor dismayed before the king of Assyria, nor before all the multitude that is with him, for the one with us is greater than the one with him.
8 With him is only an arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people relied on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.


9 After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria, while he and all his forces with him were besieging Lachish, sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,
10 “Thus says Sennacherib, king of Assyria, ‘On what are you trusting that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?
11 Is not Hezekiah misleading you to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, “The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria”?
12 Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, “You shall worship before one altar and on it you shall burn incense”?
13 Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand?
14 Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed who could deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand?
15 Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less shall your God deliver you from my hand?’”


16 And his servants spoke further against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.
17 He also wrote letters to insult the LORD, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, “As the gods of the nations of the lands who have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah shall not deliver his people from my hand.”
18 And they called out with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, that they might capture the city.
19 And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of men’s hands.


20 But King Hezekiah and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this and cried out to heaven.
21 And the LORD sent an angel who cut off every mighty warrior, commander, and officer in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned in shame to his own land. And when he entered the house of his god, some of his own offspring killed him there by the sword.
22 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others, and he guided them on every side.
23 And many brought gifts to the LORD at Jerusalem and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from then on.


24 In those days Hezekiah became sick to the point of death, and he prayed to the LORD, and he spoke to him and gave him a sign.
25 But Hezekiah did not respond according to the benefit done to him, for his heart was lifted up; therefore wrath came on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.
26 However, Hezekiah humbled the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come on them in the days of Hezekiah.


27 Now Hezekiah had immense riches and honor, and he made for himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of valuable vessels;
28 storehouses also for the produce of grain, wine, and oil; stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds for the flocks.
29 He made cities for himself, and acquired flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very great possessions.
30 It was the same Hezekiah who stopped the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them downward to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all that he did.
31 And so in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who were sent to him to inquire of the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him alone to test him, that he might know all that was in his heart.


32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of devotion, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
33 So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 33


1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
2 And he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel.
3 For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had torn down, and he erected altars for the Baals and made Asherim, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.
4 He built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “In Jerusalem shall my name be forever.”
5 He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
6 He also made his sons pass through the fire in the Valley of Ben-hinnom, practiced soothsaying, used divination, practiced sorcery, and dealt with mediums and with spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
7 He put the carved image of the idol that he had made in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever,
8 and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers—if only they are careful to do all that I have commanded them according to all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by the hand of Moses.”
9 So Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, to do worse than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the sons of Israel.


10 And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.
11 Therefore the LORD brought against them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, and they captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze chains, and brought him to Babylon.
12 When he was in distress, he entreated the favor of the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
13 And he prayed to him, and he was moved by his entreaty and heard his plea, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD was God.


14 Afterward he built an outer wall for the city of David west of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance of the Fish Gate; and he encircled Ophel with it and made it very high. Then he put military commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah.
15 He also removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, as well as all the altars which he had built on the mountain of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem, and he threw them outside the city.
16 He set up the altar of the LORD and sacrificed on it peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel.
17 Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed on the high places, though only to the LORD their God.


18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, behold, they are written in the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
19 His prayer also, and how he was entreated by him, and all his sin and his unfaithfulness, and the places where he built high places and set up the Asherim and the carved images before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the chronicles of Hozai.
20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And Amon his son reigned in his place.


21 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
22 And he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done; Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and he served them.
23 Moreover, he did not humble himself before the LORD as Manasseh his father had humbled himself, but Amon multiplied guilt.
24 And his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house.
25 But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.




Chapter 34


1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
2 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and did not turn aside to the right or to the left.


3 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a youth, he began to seek the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherim, the carved images, and the cast metal images.
4 And they tore down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and he cut down the incense altars that were high above them; and he smashed to pieces the Asherim, the carved images, and the cast metal images, and ground them to dust, and scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
5 Then he burned the bones of the priests on their altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
6 And in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, as far as Naphtali, in their ruins all around,
7 he broke down the altars and beat the Asherim and the carved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.


8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
9 They came to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the doorkeepers, had collected from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
10 And they gave it into the hand of the workmen who were appointed over the house of the LORD, and the workmen who were working in the house of the LORD used it to restore and repair the house.
11 They gave it to the craftsmen and the builders to buy cut stone and timber for ties and beams for the buildings which the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.
12 And the men did the work faithfully. And over them were appointed Jahath and Obadiah, Levites of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam of the sons of the Kohathites, to supervise; and other Levites, all who were skillful with musical instruments,
13 were over the burden-bearers and supervised all who did the work in every kind of service. And some of the Levites were scribes, and officers, and gatekeepers.


14 Now when they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD given through Moses.
15 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD.” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan.
16 And Shaphan brought the book to the king and also brought back word to the king, saying, “Everything that was committed to your servants, they are doing.
17 They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the LORD and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen.”
18 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, “Hilkiah the priest gave me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king.


19 And when the king heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes.
20 Then the king commanded Hilkiah and Ahikam son of Shaphan and Abdon son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,
21 “Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out against us, because our fathers have not observed the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book.”


22 So Hilkiah and those whom the king had told went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe—she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter—and they spoke to her about this.
23 And she said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Say to the man who sent you to me,
24 ‘Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am bringing evil on this place and on its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.
25 Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath is poured out on this place, and it shall not be quenched.’


26 But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus you shall say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: As for the words which you have heard,
27 because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and you humbled yourself before me, tore your clothes, and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares the LORD.
28 I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants.’” And they brought back word to the king.


29 Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
30 And the king went up to the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites, and all the people, great and small; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD.
31 And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant written in this book.
32 And he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin stand with him. So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
33 And Josiah removed all the abominations from all the territory belonging to the sons of Israel, and he made all who were present in Israel serve the LORD their God. All his days they did not turn away from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.




Chapter 35


1 Then Josiah kept a Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.
2 He set the priests in their duties and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD.
3 And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to the LORD, “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon son of David, king of Israel, built. You need no longer carry it on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel.
4 Prepare yourselves according to your fathers’ households, in your divisions, as written in the writing of David king of Israel and in the writing of Solomon his son.
5 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ households of your brothers, the sons of the people, and according to the division of the fathers’ households of the Levites.
6 Now slaughter the Passover lamb and consecrate yourselves, and prepare it for your brothers to do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.”


7 Josiah contributed to the people, to all who were present, flocks of lambs and young goats, all for the Passover offerings, numbering thirty thousand, and three thousand cattle—these were from the king’s possessions.
8 And his officials contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, officials of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred sheep and three hundred cattle.
9 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for Passover offerings five thousand sheep and five hundred cattle.


10 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place and the Levites in their divisions according to the command of the king.
11 And they slaughtered the Passover lamb, and the priests sprinkled the blood that they received from their hand, while the Levites flayed them.
12 And they set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the divisions of the fathers’ households of the sons of the people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the Book of Moses. And they did the same with the cattle.
13 And they roasted the Passover lamb with fire according to the ordinance, and boiled the holy offerings in pots, in kettles, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the sons of the people.
14 And afterward they prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night. So the Levites prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.
15 And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer, and the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not need to depart from their service, for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.


16 So all the service of the LORD was prepared that day, to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD according to the command of King Josiah.
17 And the sons of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days.
18 And there had not been a Passover kept like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; nor had any of the kings of Israel kept such a Passover as Josiah kept, with the priests, the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.


20 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him.
21 But he sent messengers to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to hurry. Stop opposing God who is with me, that he not destroy you.”
22 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but came to fight in the plain of Megiddo.
23 And the archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly wounded.”
24 So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem, and he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.


25 Jeremiah lamented for Josiah, and all the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and they made them a statute in Israel. Behold, they are written in the Lamentations.
26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of devotion according to what is written in the Law of the LORD,
27 and his acts, first and last, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.




Chapter 36


1 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in the place of his father.
2 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
3 And the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and imposed on the land a fine of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
4 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim, his brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took his brother Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt.


5 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD his God.
6 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him and bound him with bronze chains to take him to Babylon.
7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried some of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon and put them in his temple in Babylon.
8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah? And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.


9 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD.
10 At the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.


11 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
12 And he did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD his God; he did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the LORD.
13 He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD, the God of Israel.


14 Moreover, all the leaders of the priests and the people transgressed very much according to all the abominations of the nations, and they defiled the house of the LORD which he had sanctified in Jerusalem.
15 And the LORD, the God of their fathers, sent word to them again and again by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place.
16 But they mocked the messengers of God, despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD rose against his people, and there was no remedy.


17 Therefore he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or infirm; he gave them all into his hand.
18 All the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king and of his officials, he brought them all to Babylon.
19 And they burned the house of God and tore down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious vessels.
20 And those who had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon, and they became servants to him and to his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia.
21 This was to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days of its desolation it kept Sabbath to fulfill seventy years.


22 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying,
23 “Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has appointed me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever among you of all his people—may the LORD his God be with him—let him go up.”﻿Ezra


Chapter 1


1 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, so that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing, saying,
2 “Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
3 Whoever among you of all His people (may his God be with him) let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel. He is the God who is in Jerusalem.
4 And every survivor, wherever he sojourns, let the men of his place assist him with silver, gold, goods, and cattle, together with freewill offerings for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.”


5 Then the heads of the fathers’ houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, everyone whose spirit God had stirred, rose up to go and rebuild the house of the LORD that is in Jerusalem.
6 And all those around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with cattle, and with precious things, besides all that was freely offered.


7 And King Cyrus brought out the vessels of the house of the LORD which Nebuchadnezzar had brought out from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods.
8 Cyrus king of Persia brought them out under the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
9 And this was their number: thirty gold basins, one thousand silver basins, twenty-nine knives,
10 thirty gold bowls, four hundred ten silver bowls of a second sort, and one thousand other vessels.
11 All the vessels of gold and silver were five thousand four hundred. All these Sheshbazzar brought up when the exiles were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.




Chapter 2


1 Now these are the sons of the province who went up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city.
2 They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

26 The sons of Ramah and Geba, six hundred twenty-one.
27 The men of Michmas, one hundred twenty-two.
28 The men of Bethel and Ai, two hundred twenty-three.
29 The sons of Nebo, fifty-two.
30 The sons of Magbish, one hundred fifty-six.
31 The sons of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty-four.
32 The sons of Harim, three hundred twenty.
33 The sons of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty-five.
34 The sons of Jericho, three hundred forty-five.
35 The sons of Senaah, three thousand six hundred thirty.


36 The priests: the sons of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy-three.
37 The sons of Immer, one thousand fifty-two.
38 The sons of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred forty-seven.
39 The sons of Harim, one thousand seventeen.


40 The Levites: the sons of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodaviah, seventy-four.


41 The singers: the sons of Asaph, one hundred twenty-eight.


42 The sons of the gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, the sons of Shobai, one hundred thirty-nine.


43 The temple servants: the sons of Ziha, the sons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaoth,
44 the sons of Keros, the sons of Siaha, the sons of Padon,
45 the sons of Lebanah, the sons of Hagabah, the sons of Akkub,
46 the sons of Hagab, the sons of Shamlai, the sons of Hanan,
47 the sons of Giddel, the sons of Gahar, the sons of Reaiah,
48 the sons of Rezin, the sons of Nekoda, the sons of Gazzam,
49 the sons of Uzza, the sons of Paseah, the sons of Besai,
50 the sons of Asnah, the sons of Meunim, the sons of Nephisim,
51 the sons of Bakbuk, the sons of Hakupha, the sons of Harhur,
52 the sons of Bazluth, the sons of Mehida, the sons of Harsha,
53 the sons of Barkos, the sons of Sisera, the sons of Temah,
54 the sons of Neziah, the sons of Hatipha.


55 The sons of Solomon’s servants: the sons of Sotai, the sons of Hassophereth, the sons of Peruda,
56 the sons of Jaala, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel,
57 the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the sons of Ami.


58 All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon’s servants were three hundred ninety-two.


59 And these were the ones who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but they could not show their fathers’ houses or their ancestry, whether they were from Israel:
60 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred fifty-two.


61 And of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name.
62 These sought their record among those registered by genealogy, but they were not found; therefore they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood.
63 And the governor told them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim.


64 The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,
65 besides their male and female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven, and among them two hundred male and female singers.
66 Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six, their mules two hundred forty-five,
67 their camels four hundred thirty-five, and their donkeys six thousand seven hundred twenty.


68 Some of the heads of fathers’ houses, when they came to the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to establish it in its place.
69 They gave according to their ability for the treasury of the work sixty-one thousand gold drachmas, five thousand silver minas, and one hundred priests’ garments.


70 So the priests and the Levites and some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants lived in their towns, and all Israel in their towns.




Chapter 3


1 When the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in the towns, the people gathered as one man to Jerusalem.
2 Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his brothers, arose and built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the Law of Moses, the man of God.
3 They set the altar in its place, for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the lands, and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, burnt offerings morning and evening.
4 And they kept the Feast of Booths, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance, as the duty of each day required,
5 and afterward the continual burnt offering, and those for the new moons, and for all the appointed feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and those of everyone who offered a freewill offering to the LORD.
6 From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, but the foundation of the temple of the LORD had not yet been laid.


7 So they gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the permission granted them by Cyrus king of Persia.


8 Now in the second year after their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers, the priests and the Levites, and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work. They appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to supervise the work of the house of the LORD.
9 Then Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together stood to oversee those who worked in the house of God, along with the sons of Henadad, their sons and brothers, the Levites.


10 When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests stood in their vestments with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD according to the directions of David king of Israel.
11 And they sang responsively, giving thanks to the LORD:


“For He is good,
for His steadfast love toward Israel endures forever.”


And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD had been laid.
12 But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ houses, the old men who had seen the former house, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, while many shouted aloud for joy,
13 so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people’s weeping, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard far away.




Chapter 4


1 When the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple to the LORD, the God of Israel,
2 they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of fathers’ houses and said to them, “Let us build with you, for we seek your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.”
3 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathers’ houses of Israel said to them, “You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God, but we ourselves alone will build to the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.”


4 Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in building,
5 and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.


6 And in the reign of Ahasuerus, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.


7 And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated from Aramaic.
8 Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows:


9 Then Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges, the governors, the officials, the Persians, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa (that is, the Elamites),
10 and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and the rest of the province Beyond the River, wrote.


11 This is the copy of the letter they sent to him:


“To Artaxerxes the king,
Your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River, and now:


12 Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have come to Jerusalem. They are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city, finishing its walls and repairing the foundations.
13 Now let it be known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and the royal revenue will suffer.
14 Now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not fitting for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore we send and inform the king,
15 so that a search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will find in the record and know that this city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces, and that rebellion has been stirred up in it from ancient days. For this reason the city was destroyed.
16 We make known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, you will have no possession Beyond the River.”


17 The king sent an answer:


“To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River, peace. And now:


18 The letter that you sent to us has been clearly read before me.
19 And I issued a decree, and a search has been made, and it has been found that this city from ancient days has risen up against kings, and rebellion and sedition have been made in it.
20 Mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the province Beyond the River, and tribute, custom, and toll were paid to them.
21 Therefore make a decree to stop these men, that this city be not rebuilt until a decree is made by me.
22 And take care not to be negligent in this matter. Why should damage increase to the detriment of the kings?”


23 Then, when the copy of King Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates, they went quickly to the Jews in Jerusalem and by force and power made them stop.


24 Then the work of the house of God that is in Jerusalem stopped, and it was halted until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.




Chapter 5


1 Then the prophets Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.
2 Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and the prophets of God were with them, supporting them.


3 At that time Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and their associates came to them and said to them, “Who issued a decree for you to build this house and to finish this structure?”
4 They also said to them, “What are the names of the men who are building this building?”
5 But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until a report should come to Darius and a written answer be returned concerning it.


6 This is the copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and his associates, the officials who were in the province Beyond the River, sent to Darius the king.
7 They sent him a report, in which it was written as follows:


“To Darius the king, all peace.


8 Let it be known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. It is being built with large stones, and timber is being laid in the walls. This work is being done with diligence and is prospering in their hands.
9 Then we asked those elders and said to them, ‘Who issued a decree for you to build this house and to finish this structure?’
10 We also asked them their names, in order to make them known to you, that we might write down the names of the men who are at their head.
11 And this was their answer to us: ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.
12 But because our fathers angered the God of heaven, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried the people away to Babylon.
13 However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
14 And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, King Cyrus brought out of the temple of Babylon, and they were given to one named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor.
15 And he said to him, “Take these vessels, go, and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site.”
16 Then that Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God that is in Jerusalem. And from that time until now it has been under construction, and it is not yet finished.’


17 Therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon, to see whether it is so that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision concerning this matter.”




Chapter 6


1 Then King Darius issued a decree, and a search was made in the archives where the treasures were stored in Babylon.
2 And in Ecbatana, the fortress which is in the province of Media, a scroll was found, and in it this was written for a record:


3 “In the first year of Cyrus the king, King Cyrus issued a decree: Concerning the house of God in Jerusalem, let the house be rebuilt, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be firmly laid. Its height shall be sixty cubits, and its width sixty cubits,
4 with three layers of large stones and one layer of timber. Let the cost be given from the royal treasury.
5 And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought back to the temple in Jerusalem, each to its place, and put them in the house of God.”


6 “Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates, the officials Beyond the River, keep away from there.
7 Leave the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site.
8 Moreover, I issue a decree concerning what you shall do for these elders of the Jews in the rebuilding of this house of God: the cost is to be paid in full to these men from the royal revenue, from the tribute of the province Beyond the River, without delay.
9 And whatever is needed—young bulls, rams, lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the request of the priests who are in Jerusalem—let it be given to them day by day without fail,
10 that they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
11 Also I issue a decree that if anyone alters this edict, a beam shall be pulled out of his house and he shall be impaled on it, and his house shall be made a pile of rubble for this.
12 And may the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who shall put forth a hand to alter this or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued the decree; let it be done with diligence.”


13 Then Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates did with all diligence what Darius the king had ordered.
14 And the elders of the Jews built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished building according to the decree of the God of Israel and by the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
15 And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.


16 And the sons of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the returned exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy.
17 They offered for the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering for all Israel, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
18 And they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.


19 On the fourteenth day of the first month, the returned exiles kept the Passover.
20 For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean. They slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.
21 And the sons of Israel who had returned from exile ate it, together with all who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the land to seek the LORD, the God of Israel.
22 And they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, for the LORD had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.




Chapter 7


1 Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,
2 son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,
3 son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,
4 son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,
5 son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest—
6 this Ezra went up from Babylon. He was a scribe skilled in the Law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all that he requested, for the hand of the LORD his God was upon him.


7 Some of the sons of Israel and some of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
8 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
9 For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was upon him.
10 For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the LORD, to do it, and to teach His statutes and ordinances in Israel.


11 Now this is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD and of His statutes for Israel:


12 “Artaxerxes, king of kings,
To Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven: Peace. And now:


13 I issue a decree that any of the sons of Israel and their priests and Levites in my kingdom who freely choose to go to Jerusalem may go with you.
14 For you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God which is in your hand,
15 and to bring the silver and gold that the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
16 and all the silver and gold that you find in all the province of Babylon, together with the freewill offering of the people and the priests, offered willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem.
17 Therefore you shall with diligence buy with this money bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
18 And whatever seems good to you and your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, you may do according to the will of your God.
19 The vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem.
20 And whatever else may be needed for the house of your God, which you have occasion to provide, provide it from the royal treasury.


21 And I, Artaxerxes the king, issue a decree to all the treasurers who are in the province Beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, requires of you, it shall be done with all diligence,
22 up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred cors of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and salt without limit.
23 Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with diligence for the house of the God of heaven, so that wrath may not come upon the kingdom of the king and his sons.
24 We also make known to you that it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or other servants of this house of God.


25 And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people who are in the province Beyond the River, all who know the laws of your God; and those who do not know them, you shall teach.
26 And whoever will not obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether for death or for banishment, or for confiscation of goods, or for imprisonment.”


27 Blessed be the LORD, the God of our fathers, who put such a thing as this into the heart of the king, to glorify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem,
28 and who extended steadfast love to me before the king, his counselors, and all the mighty officials of the king. And I took courage, for the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.




Chapter 8


1 These are the heads of their fathers’ houses and the genealogical list of those who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of King Artaxerxes:
2 Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush;
3 of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered one hundred fifty males;
4 of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males;
5 of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males;
6 of the sons of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males;
7 of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males;
8 of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him eighty males;
9 of the sons of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred eighteen males;
10 of the sons of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him one hundred sixty males;
11 of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males;
12 of the sons of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him one hundred ten males;
13 of the sons of Adonikam, those who came later, their names being Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males;
14 of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.


15 I gathered them by the river that runs to Ahava, and we camped there three days. I looked among the people and the priests but found none of the sons of Levi there.
16 Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, leading men, and also for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were teachers.
17 And I sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphia, and told them what to say to Iddo and his brothers, the temple servants at the place Casiphia, to bring us ministers for the house of our God.
18 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of insight, of the sons of Mahli son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah with his sons and his brothers, eighteen;
19 and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, twenty;
20 and from the temple servants, whom David and the officials had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred twenty temple servants. All of them were listed by name.


21 Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from Him a safe journey for us, our children, and all our goods.
22 For I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from the enemy on the way, since we had said to the king, “The hand of our God is upon all who seek Him for good, but His power and His wrath are against all who forsake Him.”
23 So we fasted and sought our God for this, and He listened to our prayer.


24 Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,
25 and I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God that the king and his counselors and his princes and all Israel there present had offered.
26 I weighed out into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels worth one hundred talents, and one hundred talents of gold,
27 and twenty bowls of gold worth one thousand darics, and two vessels of fine bright bronze, as precious as gold.
28 And I said to them, “You are holy to the LORD, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.
29 Guard them carefully until you weigh them before the leading priests, the Levites, and the heads of fathers’ houses in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.”
30 So the priests and the Levites received the weighed-out silver and gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.


31 Then we set out from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of those who lay in wait by the way.
32 We came to Jerusalem and stayed there three days.
33 On the fourth day, the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar son of Phinehas, and with them the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.
34 Everything was counted and weighed, and all the weight was recorded at that time.


35 The exiles who had returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering—all as a burnt offering to the LORD.
36 They also delivered the king’s decrees to the king’s satraps and to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and they supported the people and the house of God.




Chapter 9


1 After these things were done, the officials approached me, saying, “The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations—from the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, the Egyptian, and the Amorite.
2 For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed has mixed with the peoples of the lands. The hand of the officials and rulers has been foremost in this unfaithfulness.”


3 When I heard this word, I tore my garment and my cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and sat appalled.
4 Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered to me because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles, while I sat appalled until the evening offering.


5 At the time of the evening offering I rose from my self-abasement, with my garment and my cloak torn, and fell on my knees and spread out my hands to the LORD my God,
6 and said, “O my God, I am ashamed and humiliated to lift my face to You, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens.
7 From the days of our fathers until this day we have been in great guilt. Because of our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands—to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to open shame, as it is this day.
8 But now for a brief moment grace has been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may brighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
9 For we are slaves, yet our God has not abandoned us in our slavery, but has extended steadfast love to us before the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.


10 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments,
11 which You commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land that you are entering to possess is a land defiled by the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations that have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness.
12 Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your sons forever.’
13 After all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, since You our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have given us such a remnant as this,
14 shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Would You not be angry with us until You consumed us, so that there would be no remnant nor any who escape?
15 O LORD, God of Israel, You are righteous, for we are left as a remnant that has escaped, as it is this day. See, we are before You in our guilt, for none can stand before You because of this.”




Chapter 10


1 While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and falling down before the house of God, a very great assembly of Israel, men, women, and children, gathered to him, for the people wept bitterly.
2 And Shecaniah son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, yet now there is hope for Israel in spite of this.
3 Therefore let us make a covenant with our God to send away all the wives and those born of them, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the Law.
4 Arise, for it is your task, and we are with you; be strong and act.”


5 Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests, the Levites, and all Israel swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore.
6 Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. There he spent the night; he did not eat bread or drink water, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
7 And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem,
8 and that whoever did not come within three days, according to the counsel of the officials and the elders, all his property should be forfeited, and he himself separated from the assembly of the exiles.


9 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within three days—it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month—and all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.
10 And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful and have married foreign women, increasing the guilt of Israel.
11 Now make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do His will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign women.”
12 Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, “It is so; we must do as you have said.
13 But the people are many, and it is the season of heavy rain, and we cannot stand outside. Nor is this a work that can be done in one or two days, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
14 Let our officials stand for the whole assembly, and let all in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of each city and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God concerning this matter is turned from us.”
15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah stood against this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.


16 Then the exiles did so. Ezra the priest selected men who were heads of fathers’ houses, according to their fathers’ houses, all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to examine the matter,
17 and by the first day of the first month they had finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.


18 Now among the sons of the priests who had married foreign women were found: from the sons of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers, Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
19 They pledged themselves to send away their wives, and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt.
20 From the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
21 From the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.
22 From the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.


23 From the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
24 From the singers: Eliashib. From the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.


25 And from Israel: from the sons of Parosh, Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah;
26 from the sons of Elam, Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah;
27 from the sons of Zattu, Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza;
28 from the sons of Bebai, Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai;
29 from the sons of Bani, Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth;
30 from the sons of Pahath-moab, Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh;
31 from the sons of Harim, Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
32 Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah;
33 from the sons of Hashum, Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei;
34 from the sons of Bani, Maadai, Amram, Uel,
35 Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,
36 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
37 Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasai,
38 Bani, Binnui, Shimei,
39 Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,
40 Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
41 Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
42 Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph;
43 from the sons of Nebo, Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah.


44 All these had taken foreign wives, and some of them had wives who bore children.﻿Nehemiah


Chapter 1


1 The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in Susa the citadel,
2 that Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
3 And they said to me, “The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.”


4 When I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven.
5 And I said, “O LORD, God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love Him and keep His commandments,
6 let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open, to hear the prayer of Your servant that I now pray before You day and night for the sons of Israel Your servants, confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both I and my father’s house have sinned.
7 We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances that You commanded Your servant Moses.
8 Remember the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,
9 but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though your outcasts are at the farthest part of heaven, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place that I have chosen to make My name dwell there.’
10 These are Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.
11 O Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and to the prayer of Your servants who delight to fear Your name, and grant success to Your servant today, and give him mercy in the sight of this man.”


Now I was cupbearer to the king.




Chapter 2


1 In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence before.
2 And the king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart.” Then I was very much afraid.
3 I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ graves, lies in ruins, and its gates have been consumed by fire?”
4 Then the king said to me, “What are you requesting?” So I prayed to the God of heaven.
5 And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor before you, send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ graves, that I may rebuild it.”
6 And the king said to me (the queen was sitting beside him) “How long will your journey be, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a time.
7 And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah,
8 and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress that belongs to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter.” And the king granted me what I asked, for the good hand of my God was upon me.


9 Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.
10 But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard of it, it displeased them greatly that someone had come to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel.


11 So I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days.
12 Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me except the one on which I rode.
13 I went out by night by the Valley Gate, toward the Dragon Spring and to the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that were broken down and its gates that had been consumed by fire.
14 Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass.
15 So I went up by night along the valley and inspected the wall, and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned.
16 And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, and I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the rest who were to do the work.


17 Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach.”
18 And I told them of the hand of my God that had been good upon me, and also of the words that the king had spoken to me. And they said, “Let us rise up and build.” So they strengthened their hands for the good work.


19 But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant and Geshem the Arabian heard of it, they mocked us and despised us and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”
20 Then I answered them and said to them, “The God of heaven will make us prosper, and we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion or right or memorial in Jerusalem.”

Chapter 4


1 When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he was angry and greatly enraged, and he mocked the Jews.
2 And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore it for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish it in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubble, burned as they are?”
3 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, “Yes, what they are building—if a fox goes up on it, he will break down their stone wall!”


4 Hear, O our God, for we are despised. Turn back their reproach on their own head and give them over to be plundered in a land of captivity.
5 Do not cover their guilt, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You, for they have provoked You to anger before the builders.


6 So we built the wall, and all the wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.


7 But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and that the gaps were beginning to be closed, they were very angry.
8 And they all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it.
9 But we prayed to our God, and we set a guard as protection against them day and night.


10 Then in Judah it was said,
“The strength of the burden bearers fails,
and there is much rubble;
we are not able to rebuild the wall.”


11 And our adversaries said, “They will not know or see until we come among them and kill them and cause the work to cease.”
12 When the Jews who lived near them came, they said to us ten times from every place, “You must return to us.”


13 So I stationed men at the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, and I set the people by families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
14 And I looked and rose up and said to the nobles, to the officials, and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”


15 When our enemies heard that their plan had been known to us and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his work.
16 From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and the coats of mail, and the officers stood behind all the house of Judah
17 who were building the wall. Those who carried burdens loaded themselves in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and held his weapon with the other.
18 And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built. The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me.


19 And I said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and spread out, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another.
20 Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.”


21 So we labored at the work, and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out.
22 I also said to the people at that time, “Let every man and his servant spend the night within Jerusalem, that they may be a guard for us by night and may labor by day.”
23 So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes; each kept his weapon even when taking water.




Chapter 5


1 Then there arose a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers.
2 For there were those who said, “We, our sons, and our daughters are many; therefore we must get grain so that we may eat and live.”
3 There were also those who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses to get grain because of the famine.”
4 And there were those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax on our fields and our vineyards.
5 Now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children; yet we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, for our fields and our vineyards belong to others.”


6 I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words.
7 I consulted with myself, and I brought charges against the nobles and the officials. I said to them, “You are exacting interest, each from his brother.” And I held a great assembly against them
8 and said to them, “We, as far as we are able, have bought back our Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations, but you even sell your brothers so that they must be sold back to us!” They were silent and could not find a word to say.
9 So I said, “The thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God to prevent the reproach of the nations, our enemies?
10 Moreover, I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Let us stop this taking of interest.
11 Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, and the hundredth part of the money, the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you have been exacting from them.”
12 Then they said, “We will restore these and require nothing from them. We will do as you say.” So I called the priests and made them swear to do according to this promise.
13 I also shook out the fold of my garment and said, “So may God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who does not perform this promise; thus may he be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen,” and they praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.


14 Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food allowance of the governor.
15 The former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens on the people and took from them forty shekels of silver besides bread and wine. Even their servants lorded it over the people, but I did not do so, because of the fear of God.
16 I also devoted myself to the work on this wall, and we acquired no land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work.
17 Moreover, there were at my table a hundred fifty men, Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us.
18 Now what was prepared for each day was one ox and six choice sheep; also birds were prepared for me, and once in ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet for all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor, because the service was heavy on this people.
19 Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people.




Chapter 6


1 When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had built the wall and that no breach remained in it—though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates—
2 Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to harm me.
3 So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to you?”
4 They sent to me four times in this way, and I answered them in the same manner.


5 Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way a fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.
6 In it was written, “It is reported among the nations—and Geshem also says it—that you and the Jews intend to rebel; therefore you are building the wall, and according to these reports you wish to become their king.
7 And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now the king will hear of these reports. So come now, let us take counsel together.”
8 Then I sent to him, saying, “There are no such things as you say being done, for you are inventing them in your own heart.”
9 For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will drop from the work, and it will not be done.” But now, O God, strengthen my hands.


10 Now I went into the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah son of Mehetabel, who was shut in, and he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; by night they are coming to kill you.”
11 But I said, “Should a man like me flee? And who such as I could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.”
12 And I understood that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
13 He was hired that I might be afraid and act in this way and sin, and so they could give me a bad name in order to reproach me.
14 Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, according to these things that they did, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who were trying to frighten me.


15 So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul, in fifty-two days.
16 And when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations around us were afraid and fell greatly in their own eyes, for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.


17 Moreover, in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them.
18 For many in Judah were bound to him by oath, because he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.
19 They also spoke of his good deeds before me and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.




Chapter 7


1 When the wall had been built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed,
2 I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the commander of the fortress, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.
3 And I said to them, “Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot, and while they are standing guard let them shut and bar the doors. Appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each at his watch post and each opposite his own house.”


4 Now the city was wide and large, but the people in it were few, and no houses had been rebuilt.
5 Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles and the officials and the people to be registered by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found written in it:


6 These are the sons of the province who came up out of the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city.
7 They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.

17 The sons of Azgad, two thousand three hundred twenty-two.
18 The sons of Adonikam, six hundred sixty-seven.
19 The sons of Bigvai, two thousand sixty-seven.
20 The sons of Adin, six hundred fifty-five.
21 The sons of Ater, of Hezekiah, ninety-eight.
22 The sons of Hashum, three hundred twenty-eight.
23 The sons of Bezai, three hundred twenty-four.
24 The sons of Hariph, one hundred twelve.
25 The sons of Gibeon, ninety-five.


26 The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, one hundred eighty-eight.
27 The men of Anathoth, one hundred twenty-eight.
28 The men of Beth-azmaveth, forty-two.
29 The men of Kiriath-jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred forty-three.
30 The men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred twenty-one.
31 The men of Michmas, one hundred twenty-two.
32 The men of Bethel and Ai, one hundred twenty-three.
33 The men of the other Nebo, fifty-two.
34 The sons of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty-four.
35 The sons of Harim, three hundred twenty.
36 The sons of Jericho, three hundred forty-five.
37 The sons of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty-one.
38 The sons of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred thirty.


39 The priests: the sons of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy-three.
40 The sons of Immer, one thousand fifty-two.
41 The sons of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred forty-seven.
42 The sons of Harim, one thousand seventeen.


43 The Levites: the sons of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodevah, seventy-four.


44 The singers: the sons of Asaph, one hundred forty-eight.


45 The gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, the sons of Shobai, one hundred thirty-eight.


46 The temple servants: the sons of Ziha, the sons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaoth,
47 the sons of Keros, the sons of Sia, the sons of Padon,
48 the sons of Lebanah, the sons of Hagabah, the sons of Shalmai,
49 the sons of Hanan, the sons of Giddel, the sons of Gahar,
50 the sons of Reaiah, the sons of Rezin, the sons of Nekoda,
51 the sons of Gazzam, the sons of Uzza, the sons of Paseah,
52 the sons of Besai, the sons of Meunim, the sons of Nephushesim,
53 the sons of Bakbuk, the sons of Hakupha, the sons of Harhur,
54 the sons of Bazlith, the sons of Mehida, the sons of Harsha,
55 the sons of Barkos, the sons of Sisera, the sons of Temah,
56 the sons of Neziah, the sons of Hatipha.


57 The sons of Solomon’s servants: the sons of Sotai, the sons of Sophereth, the sons of Perida,
58 the sons of Jaala, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel,
59 the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the sons of Amon.


60 All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon’s servants were three hundred ninety-two.


61 And these were the ones who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove their fathers’ houses nor their descent, whether they were of Israel:
62 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred forty-two.
63 And of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name.
64 These sought their registration among those recorded in the genealogies, but it was not found, so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.
65 And the governor told them that they were not to eat of the most holy things until a priest should arise with Urim and Thummim.


66 The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,
67 besides their male and female servants, who were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven, and they had two hundred forty-five singers, male and female.
68 Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six, their mules two hundred forty-five,
69 their camels four hundred thirty-five, and their donkeys six thousand seven hundred twenty.


70 Now some of the heads of fathers’ houses gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold, fifty bowls, and five hundred thirty priestly garments.
71 And some of the heads of fathers’ houses gave to the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand two hundred minas of silver.
72 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, two thousand minas of silver, and sixty-seven priestly garments.


73 So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel lived in their cities.


When the seventh month came, the sons of Israel were in their cities.




Chapter 8


1 All the people gathered as one man in the square before the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded Israel.
2 So Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could understand what they heard, on the first day of the seventh month.
3 And he read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.
4 And Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden platform that had been made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people; and as he opened it, all the people stood.
6 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God; and all the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
7 Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, helped the people to understand the law, while the people remained in their places.
8 They read from the book, from the law of God, clearly, and they gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.


9 And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep.” For all the people wept as they heard the words of the law.
10 Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat and drink sweet wine and send portions to anyone who has nothing ready, for this day is holy to our LORD. And do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.”
11 So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be quiet, for this day is holy; do not be grieved.”
12 And all the people went their way to eat and drink and to send portions and to make great rejoicing, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.


13 On the second day the heads of fathers' houses of all the people, with the priests and Levites, came together to Ezra the scribe in order to study the words of the law.
14 And they found it written in the law that the LORD had commanded by Moses that the people of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month,
15 and that they should proclaim it and publish it in all their towns and in Jerusalem, “Go out to the hills and bring branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees to make booths, as it is written.”
16 So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on his roof, and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God, and in the square at the Water Gate and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim.
17 And all the assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in the booths. For from the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the people of Israel had not done so. And there was very great rejoicing.
18 And day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read from the book of the law of God. They kept the feast seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the rule.




Chapter 9


1 On the twenty-fourth day of this month, the Israelites assembled, fasting and wearing sackcloth and putting dust on their heads.
2 And the Israelites separated themselves from all foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
3 And they stood in their place and read from the book of the law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day, and for another quarter they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God.
4 Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless the LORD your God forever and ever! Blessed be Your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise!”
5 And Ezra said, “Bless the LORD, the God of our fathers, and let His name be exalted forever and ever, and let the glory of His kingdom be exalted above all.

6 You are the LORD, You alone; You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and You preserve them all, and the host of heaven worships You.
7 You are the LORD, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham;
8 and You found his heart faithful before You, and You made a covenant with him to give to his offspring the land of the Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Perizzite, Jebusite, and Girgashite. And You have fulfilled Your words, for You are righteous.
9 And You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and You heard their cry at the Red Sea;
10 and You showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land, for You knew that they acted arrogantly against them, and You made a name for Yourself, as it is this day.
11 And You divided the sea before them, so that they passed through the midst of it, but You cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into mighty waters.
12 And in a pillar of cloud You led them by day and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light on the way in which they should go.
13 You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them just ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,
14 And You made known to them Your holy Sabbath and commanded them precepts, statutes, and a law by Moses Your servant.
15 And You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger and brought water for them out of the rock for their thirst and told them to go in and take possession of the land which You had sworn to give them.


16 But they and our fathers acted arrogantly, stiffening their neck and not obeying Your commandments; they refused to obey and were not mindful of Your wonders that You performed among them.
17 But You are a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in steadfast love, and You did not forsake them.
18 Even when they made a golden calf and said, ‘This is your god who brought you out of Egypt,’ and committed great blasphemies,
19 yet You in Your great mercy did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud did not depart from them by day, to lead them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night, to give them light, to go in the way that they should go.
20 You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them and did not withhold manna from their mouth and gave them water for their thirst.
21 Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.

22 And You gave them kingdoms and peoples and allotted to them lands, so that they might take possession of the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan.
23 And their descendants went in and possessed the land, and You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hand with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
24 And they took fortified cities and a rich land, and they lived in it and took possession of houses filled with all good things, cisterns already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. And they ate and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in Your great goodness.
25 Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against You and cast Your law behind their backs and killed Your prophets, who testified against them, to bring upon them great wrath.
26 Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who oppressed them. And in the time of their trouble, when they cried to You, You heard them from heaven, and according to Your great mercy You gave them saviors who saved them from the hand of their enemies.


27 Yet they acted arrogantly and sinned against You and rebelled in Your commandments. They turned aside and spoke against Your laws, whose keeping would have given them life, and they turned back and killed Your prophets, who testified against them, to bring upon them great wrath.
28 Therefore You delivered them into the hand of the peoples of the lands, and those who hated them ruled over them. And in the time of their trouble, they cried to You, and You heard them from heaven, and according to Your great mercy You gave them saviors, who saved them from the hand of those who hated them.
29 But after they had rest, they again did evil before You. Therefore, You left them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them. Yet in the time of their trouble, they cried to You, and You heard from heaven, and many times You delivered them according to Your mercy.
30 And You warned them to return to Your law, but they acted arrogantly and did not obey Your commandments, but sinned against Your judgments, which, if a man does them, he shall live by them, and they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not hear.
31 Yet in Your great mercy You did not utterly consume them or forsake them, for You are a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in steadfast love, and You did not forsake them.


32 Indeed, many times You delivered them according to Your mercy, and they again acted arrogantly and rebelled against You. And You left them in the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them.
33 But in the time of their trouble, when they cried to You, You heard them from heaven, and according to Your great mercy You gave them saviors, who saved them from the hand of their enemies.
34 And You multiplied Your wondrous works and Your deeds of power against them, and You delivered them into the hand of those who hated them.
35 And You gave them kingdoms and peoples and allotted to them lands, so that they might take possession of the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan.
36 And their descendants went in and possessed the land, and You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hand with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
37 And they took fortified cities and a rich land, and they lived in it and took possession of houses filled with all good things, cisterns already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. And they ate and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in Your great goodness.


38 Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against You and cast Your law behind their backs and killed Your prophets, who testified against them, to bring upon them great wrath.

29 joined with their brothers, their nobles, and entered into a curse and an oath to walk in God’s Law that was given through Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord and His ordinances and His statutes.


30 We will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons.
31 If the peoples of the land bring goods or any grain on the Sabbath day to sell, we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or on a holy day. And we will forego the crops of the seventh year and every debt.


32 We also take upon ourselves the obligation to give yearly a third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God:
33 for the showbread, the regular grain offering, the regular burnt offering, the Sabbaths, the new moons, the appointed feasts, the holy things, and the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.


34 We, the priests, the Levites, and the people, have cast lots for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God according to our fathers’ houses, at appointed times year by year, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the Law.
35 We obligate ourselves to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits of all fruit of every tree, year by year, to the house of the LORD,
36 also to bring to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God, the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, as it is written in the Law, and the firstborn of our herds and of our flocks.
37 We will bring the first of our dough and our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine, and the oil to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithes of our ground to the Levites, for the Levites collect the tithes in all the towns where we work.
38 A priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes. And the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers of the storehouse.
39 For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of grain, wine, and oil to the chambers where the vessels of the sanctuary are, as well as the priests who minister, the gatekeepers, and the singers.


We will not neglect the house of our God.




Chapter 11


1 And the leaders of the people dwelt in Jerusalem; the rest of the people cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, and nine parts in the other cities.
2 And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered to dwell in Jerusalem.


3 Now these are the chiefs of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem; but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, to wit, Israelites, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants.
4 And in Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez;
5 and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Haziah, the son of Adiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of Shiloni.
6 All the sons of Perez who dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred threescore and eight valiant men.


7 And these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah.
8 And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.
9 And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer: and Judah the son of Senuah was second over the city.


10 Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.
11 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God.
12 And their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two: and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchiah.
13 And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and two: and Amashai the son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer.
14 And their brethren, mighty men of valour, a hundred twenty and eight: and their overseer was Zabdiel the son of Haggedolim.


15 Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni.
16 And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God.
17 And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer: and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren, and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
18 All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four.


19 Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that kept the gates, were an hundred seventy and two.
20 And the residue of Israel, of the priests and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.
21 But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims.


22 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha, of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the business of the house of God.
23 For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.
24 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people.


25 And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjath-arba, and in the villages thereof, and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel, and in the villages thereof,
26 and at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Beth-phelet,
27 and at Hazar-shual, and at Beersheba, and in the villages thereof,
28 and at Ziklag, and at Mekonah, and in the villages thereof,
29 and at En-rimmon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth,
30 Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish, and the fields thereof, at Azekah, and in the villages thereof. And they dwelt from Beer-sheba unto the valley of Hinnom.
31 The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and Aija, and Bethel, and in their villages,
32 and at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
35 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.
36 And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.




Chapter 12


1 These are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
2 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
3 Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
4 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,
5 Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
6 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua.


8 And the Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his brothers was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving.
9 And Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, stood opposite them in the service divisions.


10 Jeshua fathered Joiakim, Joiakim fathered Eliashib, Eliashib fathered Joiada,
11 Joiada fathered Jonathan, and Jonathan fathered Jaddua.


12 In the days of Joiakim, the priests, heads of fathers’ houses, were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
13 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
14 of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
15 of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
16 of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
17 of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin and Moadiah, Piltai;
18 of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
19 of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
20 of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
21 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.


22 In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, the Levites were recorded as heads of fathers’ houses, and so were the priests, during the reign of Darius the Persian.
23 The sons of Levi, heads of fathers’ houses, were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles up to the days of Johanan son of Eliashib.
24 And the heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, with their brothers who stood opposite them to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, division corresponding to division.
25 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers standing guard at the storerooms by the gates.
26 These were in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.


27 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought out the Levites from all their places to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with joy, with thanksgiving and singing, with cymbals, harps, and lyres.
28 And the sons of the singers gathered together from the district around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites,
29 and from Beth-gilgal and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem.
30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people and the gates and the wall.


31 Then I brought up the leaders of Judah onto the wall, and appointed two great choirs that gave thanks and went in procession. One went to the right on the wall toward the Dung Gate,
32 and after them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah,
33 and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
35 and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets—Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph—
36 and his brothers, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And Ezra the scribe went before them.
37 At the Fountain Gate they went up straight before them by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall above the house of David, to the Water Gate on the east.


38 The other choir of those who gave thanks went to the left, and I followed them with half of the people, on the wall, above the Tower of the Ovens, to the Broad Wall,
39 and above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Old Gate, and by the Fish Gate, and the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. And they stopped at the Gate of the Guard.
40 So both choirs of those who gave thanks stood in the house of God, and I and half of the officials with me,
41 and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah with trumpets,
42 and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang with Jezrahiah as their leader.


43 And they offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy. The women also and the children rejoiced, and the joy of Jerusalem was heard far away.


44 On that day men were appointed over the storerooms for the contributions, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites. For Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who ministered.
45 And they performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the command of David and Solomon, his son.
46 For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
47 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and the gatekeepers, as each day required, and they set apart the consecrated portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated portion for the sons of Aaron.




Chapter 13


1 On that day they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people, and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,
2 because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and water but hired Balaam against them to curse them. Yet our God turned the curse into a blessing.
3 When they heard the Law, they separated all those of mixed ancestry from Israel.


4 Before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God and who was related to Tobiah,
5 had prepared for him a large room where they had formerly stored the grain offering, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of grain, wine, and oil, which were commanded to be given to the Levites, the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests.
6 But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had gone to the king. After some time I asked leave of the king,
7 and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah in preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
8 I was very angry, and I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the chamber.
9 Then I gave orders, and they cleansed the chambers, and I brought back the vessels of the house of God, the grain offering, and the frankincense.


10 I also found that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers who performed the service had gone back each to his own field.
11 So I contended with the officials and said, “Why is the house of God neglected?” Then I gathered them together and stationed them at their posts.
12 Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses.
13 And I appointed treasurers over the storehouses: Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and as their assistant Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for they were considered faithful, and their task was to distribute to their brothers.
14 Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out my faithful deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for its service.


15 In those days I saw in Judah men treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys, and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them on the day they sold food.
16 Men of Tyre also lived there, who brought in fish and all kinds of merchandise and sold them on the Sabbath to the men of Judah, in Jerusalem itself.
17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day?
18 Did not your fathers act in this way, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you are adding to the wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath!”
19 As soon as it began to grow dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I stationed some of my servants at the gates, so that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day.
20 Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice,
21 but I warned them and said to them, “Why do you spend the night before the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.
22 Then I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of Your steadfast love.


23 In those days I also saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.
24 Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of other nations but could not speak the language of Judah.
25 So I contended with them and cursed them and struck some of them and pulled out their hair. I made them swear by God, saying, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.
26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women? Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Yet foreign women caused even him to sin.
27 Shall we then hear of you doing all this great evil and acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?”
28 And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, so I drove him away from me.
29 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.


30 So I purified them from everything foreign, and I appointed duties for the priests and the Levites, each to his own work.
31 And I arranged for the supply of wood at appointed times and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.﻿Esther


Chapter 1


1 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus—the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Cush over one hundred twenty-seven provinces—
2 in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on the royal throne in the citadel of Susa,
3 in the third year of his reign he gave a feast for all his officials and servants. The army of Persia and Media, the nobles and governors of the provinces were before him,
4 while he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his majestic greatness for many days, one hundred eighty days in all.


5 When these days were completed, the king made a feast lasting seven days for all the people present in the citadel of Susa, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.
6 There were white and blue curtains fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and marble pillars, and couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of alabaster, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones.
7 Drinks were served in golden vessels, each vessel different from the other, and royal wine was abundant according to the bounty of the king.
8 The drinking was done according to the law: none was compelled, for the king had instructed all the stewards of his household to do according to each man’s pleasure.


9 Queen Vashti also made a feast for the women in the royal house that belonged to King Ahasuerus.


10 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus,
11 to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown, to show the people and the officials her beauty, for she was very beautiful.
12 But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command delivered by the eunuchs. Then the king was very angry, and his wrath burned within him.


13 Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for this was the king’s custom toward all who knew law and judgment—
14 those nearest him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who saw the king’s face and sat first in the kingdom):
15 “According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti because she did not perform the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?”
16 Then Memucan said in the presence of the king and the princes, “Queen Vashti has done wrong not only against the king but also against all the princes and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.
17 For the deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to look with contempt on their husbands as they say, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she did not come.’
18 This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s act will speak in the same way to all the king’s princes, and there will be no end of contempt and wrath.


19 If it please the king, let a royal decree go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media so that it cannot be revoked, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.
20 So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, vast as it is, all women will give honor to their husbands, both great and small.”


21 The word pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan had proposed.
22 He sent letters to all the provinces of the king, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, that every man should be master in his own house and speak in the language of his own people.




Chapter 2


1 After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her.
2 Then the king’s young attendants who served him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king,
3 and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the harem under the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women. Let their cosmetics be given to them,
4 and let the young woman who pleases the king become queen instead of Vashti.” The matter pleased the king, and he did so.


5 Now there was a Jew in the citadel of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite,
6 who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the exiles who were taken into captivity with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away.
7 He was bringing up Hadassah, that is, Esther, the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman was beautiful in form and appearance, and when her father and mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.


8 So when the king’s command and decree were proclaimed and many young women were gathered in the citadel of Susa under the custody of Hegai, Esther also was taken to the king’s palace into the custody of Hegai, who was in charge of the women.
9 The young woman pleased him and found favor with him, and he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her portion of food, and with seven chosen young women from the king’s palace. He advanced her and her maids to the best place in the harem.
10 Esther had not made known her people or her kindred, for Mordecai had instructed her not to make it known.
11 And every day Mordecai walked in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and what was happening to her.


12 Now when the turn came for each young woman to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women—for this was the regular period of their beautification, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics for women—
13 when the young woman went in to the king in this way, she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king’s house.
14 In the evening she would go in, and in the morning she would return to the second harem under the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.


15 When the turn came for Esther, the daughter of Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she requested nothing except what Hegai, the king’s eunuch who had charge of the women, advised. And Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her.
16 Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
17 And the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
18 Then the king gave a great feast for all his princes and his servants: it was Esther’s feast. He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces and gave gifts according to the bounty of the king.


19 When the virgins were gathered the second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate.
20 Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had instructed her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai just as when she was brought up by him.
21 In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the doorway, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
22 But the matter became known to Mordecai, and he told Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in Mordecai’s name.
23 When the matter was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on a gallows, and it was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king.




Chapter 3


1 After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite and advanced him and set his throne above all the officials who were with him.
2 And all the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage.
3 Then the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why are you transgressing the king’s command?”
4 And when they spoke to him day after day and he did not listen to them, they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s words would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew.
5 When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was filled with fury.
6 But he thought it beneath him to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai. So Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.


7 In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, they cast lots) before Haman day after day to find the right day and month. The lot fell on the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
8 Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and separated among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king’s laws, so it is not in the king’s interest to let them remain.
9 If it pleases the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who carry out the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.”


10 So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
11 And the king said to Haman, “The silver is given to you, and the people also, to do with them as seems good to you.”


12 Then the king’s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict was written according to all that Haman commanded—to the king’s satraps, to the governors over every province, and to the officials of every people, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king’s signet ring.
13 Letters were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces to destroy, kill, and annihilate all Jews, young and old, little children and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.
14 A copy of the written decree was to be issued as law in every province and made known to all peoples so that they would be ready for that day.
15 The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was thrown into confusion.




Chapter 4


1 When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, crying out with a loud and bitter cry.
2 He went up to the entrance of the king’s gate, for no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter the king’s gate.
3 And in every province, wherever the king’s command and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and lamenting, and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.


4 When Esther’s maids and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was greatly distressed. She sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.
5 Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was happening.
6 So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king’s gate.
7 And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.
8 He also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her, and to charge her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him on behalf of her people.


9 Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said.
10 Then Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to go to Mordecai,
11 “All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law—to put him to death—except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter that he may live. But I have not been called to come to the king for thirty days.”


12 And they told Mordecai what Esther had said.
13 Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, “Do not think in your heart that you will escape in the king’s house any more than all the Jews.
14 For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows whether you have come to royal position for such a time as this?”


15 Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai,
16 “Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids also will fast in the same way. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law, and if I perish, I perish.”
17 So Mordecai went and did everything that Esther had commanded him.




Chapter 5


1 On the third day Esther put on her royal garments and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, opposite the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne inside the hall, opposite the entrance.
2 When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she found favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
3 Then the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to half of the kingdom.”
4 And Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to a banquet that I have prepared for him.”
5 Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, so that we may do as Esther has said.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.


6 And as they were drinking wine at the banquet, the king said to Esther, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom, it shall be done.”
7 Then Esther answered, “My petition and my request is this:
8 If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them tomorrow, and then I will do as the king has said.”


9 Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king’s gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.
10 Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. And he sent and brought his friends and his wife Zeresh.
11 And Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the number of his sons, and all the ways the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the officials and the servants of the king.
12 And Haman said, “Even Queen Esther let no one come with the king to the banquet she prepared but me, and tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king.
13 Yet all this is worth nothing to me so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”
14 Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go joyfully with the king to the banquet.” The advice pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made.




Chapter 6


1 That night the king could not sleep, so he commanded that the book of the records, the chronicles, be brought, and they were read before the king.
2 And it was found written how Mordecai had reported about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the doorway, who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
3 And the king said, “What honor or dignity has been done for Mordecai because of this?” Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”


4 And the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
5 The king’s servants said to him, “Haman is standing in the court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.”
6 So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “What should be done for the man whom the king delights to honor?” Now Haman said to himself, “Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?”
7 So Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor,
8 let royal garments be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown has been set.
9 And let the garments and the horse be delivered into the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes. Let them array the man whom the king delights to honor, and lead him on horseback through the open square of the city, proclaiming before him, ‘Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king delights to honor!’”


10 Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry, take the garments and the horse, as you have said, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Do not leave out anything that you have mentioned.”
11 So Haman took the garments and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the open square of the city, proclaiming before him, “Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king delights to honor!”


12 Then Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered.
13 And Haman recounted to his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the seed of the Jews, you will not overcome him but will surely fall before him.”


14 While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.




Chapter 7


1 So the king and Haman came to drink with Queen Esther.
2 And on the second day, as they were drinking wine, the king said again to Esther, “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom, it shall be done.”


3 Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request.
4 For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as male and female slaves, I would have remained silent, for our distress is not to be compared with the loss to the king.”


5 Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who has dared to do this?”
6 And Esther said, “The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.” Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.


7 The king arose in his wrath from the wine-drinking and went into the palace garden, but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king.
8 When the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. And the king said, “Will he even assault the queen while I am in the house?” As the words left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman’s face.
9 Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, “Look! The gallows that Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, stands at Haman’s house, fifty cubits high.” And the king said, “Hang him on it.”
10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath subsided.




Chapter 8


1 On that day King Ahasuerus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her.
2 And the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.


3 Then Esther spoke again before the king. She fell at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to avert the evil plan of Haman the Agagite and the scheme that he had devised against the Jews.
4 The king held out the golden scepter to Esther, and Esther rose and stood before the king.
5 She said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor before him, and if the matter seems right before the king and I am pleasing in his sight, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king.
6 For how can I bear to see the calamity that will come upon my people? And how can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?”


7 Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he stretched out his hand against the Jews.
8 Now you may write as you please concerning the Jews, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s signet ring; for a decree that is written in the name of the king and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be revoked.”


9 The king’s scribes were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day, and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, to the satraps and the governors and the princes of the provinces which extended from India to Cush, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and language.
10 He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed it with the king’s signet ring, and sent letters by mounted couriers riding on swift horses bred from the royal studs.
11 In them the king granted the Jews who were in every city the right to gather and defend their lives, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, their children, and their women, and to plunder their goods,
12 on one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
13 A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province, made known to all peoples, and that the Jews should be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
14 So the couriers, mounted on the royal horses, went out hurriedly, pressed by the king’s command, and the decree was issued in Susa the citadel.


15 Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a great crown of gold and a mantle of fine linen and purple, and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.
16 For the Jews there was light and gladness and joy and honor.
17 And in every province and in every city, wherever the king’s command and his decree came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from among the peoples of the land declared themselves Jews, for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.




Chapter 9


1 Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s command and his decree were about to be carried out, on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain power over them, it was turned to the contrary, so that the Jews gained power over those who hated them.
2 The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm, and no one could stand against them, for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples.
3 And all the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king’s work helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.
4 For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.


5 So the Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them.
6 In Susa the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men,
7 and also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,
10 the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.


11 That day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was reported to the king.
12 And the king said to Queen Esther, “In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what further request do you have? It shall be done.”
13 Then Esther said, “If it please the king, let the Jews who are in Susa be allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day’s decree, and let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows.”
14 So the king commanded that this be done; a decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.
15 The Jews who were in Susa gathered again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.


16 Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces also gathered to defend their lives and had rest from their enemies, killing seventy-five thousand of those who hated them, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17 This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
18 But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making it a day of feasting and gladness.
19 Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and of sending portions to one another.


20 Mordecai recorded these things and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,
21 obliging them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same, year by year,
22 as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow to gladness and from mourning to a good day, that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, of sending portions to one another and gifts to the poor.
23 So the Jews accepted what they had begun to do, and what Mordecai had written to them.


24 For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to crush and to destroy them.
25 But when it came before the king, he commanded by letter that his wicked plot which he had devised against the Jews should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
26 Therefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of this letter, and of what they had seen concerning this matter and what had happened to them,
27 the Jews established and accepted as a custom for themselves and for their descendants and for all who joined them, that without fail they would keep these two days according to what was written and at their appointed time every year,
28 that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city, and that these days of Purim should not fail among the Jews, nor should their remembrance perish from their descendants.


29 Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.
30 He sent letters to all the Jews, to the one hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
31 to confirm these days of Purim at their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them, and as they had established for themselves and for their descendants concerning their fasts and their lamenting.
32 And the command of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book.




Chapter 10


1 King Ahasuerus imposed tribute on the land and on the coastlands of the sea.
2 And all the acts of his power and his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
3 For Mordecai the Jew was second to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brothers, seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his descendants.﻿Job


Chapter 1


1 There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, fearing God and turning away from evil.
2 Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
3 His possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household; and that man was greater than all the men of the east.
4 His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his appointed day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
5 When the days of feasting had run their course, Job would send for them and consecrate them; he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all, for Job said, “Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did continually.


6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and the Adversary also came among them.
7 The LORD said to the Adversary, “From where do you come?” Then the Adversary answered the LORD and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”
8 The LORD said to the Adversary, “Have you set your mind on My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil.”
9 The Adversary answered the LORD and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?
10 Have You not put a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
11 But stretch out Your hand and strike all that he has, and surely he will curse You to Your face.”
12 The LORD said to the Adversary, “All that he has is in your power; only do not stretch out your hand against him.” So the Adversary went out from the presence of the LORD.


13 Now it happened on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,
14 that a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were feeding beside them,
15 and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away; they also struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
16 While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
17 While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
18 While he was still speaking, another came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,
19 and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”


20 Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and worshiped.
21 He said,


“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
and naked I shall return there.
The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away;
blessed be the name of the LORD.”


22 In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrongdoing.




Chapter 2


1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and the Adversary also came among them to present himself before the LORD.
2 The LORD said to the Adversary, “From where do you come?” The Adversary answered the LORD and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”
3 The LORD said to the Adversary, “Have you set your mind on My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil. He still holds firmly to his integrity, though you incited Me against him to destroy him without cause.”
4 The Adversary answered the LORD and said, “Skin for skin! Indeed, all that a man has he will give for his life.
5 But stretch out Your hand now and strike his bone and his flesh, and surely he will curse You to Your face.”
6 The LORD said to the Adversary, “Behold, he is in your power; only spare his life.”


7 So the Adversary went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
8 He took a potsherd to scrape himself while he sat among the ashes.
9 Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!”
10 But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Should we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.


11 Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, each came from his own place—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.
12 When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, they did not recognize him, and they raised their voices and wept; each tore his robe, and they threw dust toward heaven upon their heads.
13 They sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.




Chapter 3


1 After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
2 Job spoke and said:


3 “May the day perish on which I was born,
and the night that said, ‘A man is conceived.’
4 May that day be darkness;
may God above not seek it,
nor light shine upon it.
5 May darkness and deep shadow reclaim it;
may a cloud settle upon it;
may blackness of the day terrify it.
6 As for that night, may thick darkness seize it;
may it not rejoice among the days of the year;
may it not enter the number of the months.
7 Yes, may that night be barren;
may no joyful shout come into it.
8 Let those curse it who curse the day,
who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
9 May the stars of its dawn be dark;
may it hope for light and have none,
nor see the eyelids of the morning,
10 because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb,
nor hide trouble from my eyes.


11 Why did I not die at birth,
come forth from the womb and expire?
12 Why did knees receive me,
or why were there breasts to nurse me?
13 For now I would have lain down and been quiet;
I would have slept; then I would be at rest
14 with kings and counselors of the earth,
who rebuilt ruins for themselves,
15 or with princes who had gold,
who filled their houses with silver.
16 Or like a miscarriage hidden away, I would not exist,
as infants who never saw the light.
17 There the wicked cease from troubling,
and there the weary find rest.
18 Prisoners are at ease together;
they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
19 The small and the great are there,
and the slave is free from his master.


20 Why is light given to him who suffers,
and life to the bitter in soul,
21 who long for death, but it does not come,
and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
22 who rejoice exceedingly,
and are glad when they find the grave?
23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,
and whom God has hedged in?
24 For my sighing comes instead of my food,
and my groanings pour out like water.
25 For what I fear comes upon me,
and what I dread befalls me.
26 I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;
I have no rest, but turmoil comes.”




Chapter 4


1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:


2 “If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient?
Yet who can keep from speaking?
3 Yes, you have instructed many,
and you have strengthened weak hands.
4 Your words have upheld him who was stumbling,
and you have made feeble knees firm.
5 But now it has come to you, and you are weary;
it touches you, and you are dismayed.
6 Is not your fear of God your confidence,
and the integrity of your ways, your hope?


7 Remember now: who among the innocent ever perished?
Or where were the upright cut off?
8 As I have seen, those who plow iniquity
and sow trouble reap the same.
9 By the breath of God they perish,
and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.
10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
and the teeth of the young lions are broken.
11 The strong lion perishes for lack of prey,
and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.


12 Now a word was brought to me stealthily;
my ear received a whisper of it.
13 Amid disquieting thoughts from visions of the night,
when deep sleep falls on men,
14 dread came upon me and trembling,
which made all my bones shake.
15 Then a spirit passed before my face;
the hair of my flesh stood on end.
16 It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance;
a form was before my eyes;
there was silence, then I heard a voice:
17 ‘Can mortal man be right before God?
Can a man be pure before his Maker?
18 You will see how He puts no trust even in His servants,
and He charges His angels with error;
19 how much more those who dwell in houses of clay,
whose foundation is in the dust,
who are crushed like a moth!
20 Between morning and evening they are broken to pieces;
without anyone regarding it, they perish forever.
21 Is not their tent cord pulled up within them?
They die without wisdom.’”




Chapter 5


1 “Call now! Will anyone answer you?
And to which of the holy ones will you turn?
2 For vexation kills the fool,
and jealousy slays the simple.
3 I have seen the fool taking root,
but suddenly I cursed his dwelling.
4 His sons are far from safety;
they are crushed in the gate,
and there is no one to deliver them.
5 The hungry eat his harvest,
and take it even out of the thorns,
and the thirsty pant after his wealth.


6 For affliction does not come from the dust,
nor does trouble sprout from the ground;
7 but man is born to trouble,
as sparks fly upward.


8 But as for me, I would seek God,
and to God I would commit my cause,
9 who does great and unsearchable things,
wonders without number.
10 He gives rain on the earth
and sends water on the fields,
11 to set the lowly on high,
and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
12 He frustrates the devices of the crafty,
so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
13 He catches the wise in their own craftiness,
and the counsel of the wily is swiftly ended.
14 They meet with darkness in the daytime,
and grope at noonday as in the night.
15 But He saves the needy from the sword of their mouth,
and from the hand of the mighty.
16 So the poor have hope,
and injustice shuts its mouth.


17 How blessed is the man whom God corrects;
therefore do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
18 For He wounds, but He also binds up;
He strikes, but His hands heal.
19 In six troubles He will deliver you;
in seven no evil shall touch you.
20 In famine He will redeem you from death,
and in war from the power of the sword.
21 You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue,
and shall not fear destruction when it comes.
22 At destruction and famine you shall laugh,
and shall not fear the beasts of the earth.
23 For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field,
and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
24 You shall know that your tent is at peace,
and you shall visit your fold and find nothing missing.
25 You shall know also that your offspring shall be many,
and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
26 You shall come to the grave in ripe old age,
like a sheaf gathered up in its season.


27 Yes, this we have searched out; it is true.
Listen to it, and know it for yourself.”




Chapter 6


1 Then Job answered and said:


2 “Oh that my grief were fully weighed,
and my calamity laid in the balances together!
3 For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas;
therefore my words have been rash.
4 For the arrows of the Almighty are in me;
my spirit drinks their poison;
the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
5 Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass,
or does the ox low over his fodder?
6 Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt,
or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?
7 My soul refuses to touch them;
they are loathsome food to me.


8 Oh that my request might come to pass,
and that God would grant my desire,
9 that it would please God to crush me,
that He would loose His hand and cut me off!
10 This would still be my comfort;
I would exult in pain unsparing,
that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.


11 What is my strength, that I should wait?
And what is my end, that I should be patient?
12 Is my strength the strength of stones,
or is my flesh bronze?
13 Is it not that there is no help within me,
and that deliverance is driven from me?


14 He who withholds kindness from a friend
forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
15 My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a wadi,
like the torrents of wadis that pass away,
16 which are dark because of ice,
and in which the snow hides itself.
17 When they thaw, they vanish;
when it is hot, they disappear from their place.
18 The paths of their course wind along;
they go up into the wasteland and perish.
19 The caravans of Tema look;
the travelers of Sheba hope for them.
20 They are disappointed because they were confident;
they come there and are confounded.
21 For now you are nothing;
you see terror and are afraid.


22 Have I said, ‘Give to me’?
Or, ‘Offer a gift for me from your wealth’?
23 Or, ‘Deliver me from the hand of the adversary’?
Or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless’?


24 Teach me, and I will be silent;
make me understand how I have gone astray.
25 How painful are honest words!
But what does your argument prove?
26 Do you intend to correct my words,
when the words of a despairing man are like the wind?
27 You would even cast lots for the orphan,
and bargain over your friend.


28 But now be pleased to look at me,
for I will not lie to your face.
29 Turn, I pray, let there be no injustice;
Return again to me, my cause is righteous.
30 Is there injustice on my tongue?
Can my palate not discern calamity?”


***
Chapter 7


1 “Does not man have hard service on earth,
and are not his days like those of a hired hand?
2 Like a slave who longs for the shadow,
and like a hired man who looks for his wages,
3 so I have been allotted months of futility,
and nights of misery have been appointed to me.
4 When I lie down I say, ‘When shall I arise?’
But the night is long,
and I am full of tossing till the dawn.
5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;
my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh.
6 My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,
and come to an end without hope.


7 Remember that my life is but a breath;
my eye will never again see good.
8 The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more;
Your eyes will be upon me, but I shall be gone.
9 As the cloud fades and vanishes,
so he who goes down to the grave does not come up.
10 He returns no more to his house,
nor does his place know him any longer.


11 Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;
I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
12 Am I the sea, or a sea monster,
that You set a guard over me?
13 When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,
my couch will ease my complaint,’
14 then You frighten me with dreams
and terrify me with visions,
15 so that my soul chooses strangling,
death rather than my bones.
16 I loathe my life; I would not live forever.
Leave me alone, for my days are a breath.


17 What is man that You make much of him,
and that You set Your heart on him,
18 and visit him every morning,
and test him every moment?
19 How long will You not look away from me,
nor leave me alone till I swallow my spittle?
20 If I have sinned, what have I done to You,
O watcher of mankind?
Why have You made me Your target,
so that I am a burden to myself?
21 Why then do You not pardon my transgression
and take away my iniquity?
For now I shall lie down in the dust;
You will seek me, but I shall be no more.”




Chapter 8


1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:


2 “How long will you say these things,
and the words of your mouth be a great wind?
3 Does God pervert justice,
or does the Almighty pervert what is right?
4 If your sons sinned against Him,
He gave them over to the power of their transgression.
5 But if you will seek God
and plead with the Almighty for mercy,
6 if you are pure and upright,
surely now He will rouse Himself for you
and restore your rightful habitation.
7 Though your beginning was small,
your latter end will be very great.


8 For inquire, I pray you, of the former generation,
and pay attention to what their fathers searched out—
9 for we are but of yesterday and know nothing,
because our days on earth are a shadow—
10 will they not teach you and tell you,
and utter words from their heart?


11 Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh?
Can reeds flourish without water?
12 While it is still green and not cut down,
it withers before any other plant.
13 Such are the paths of all who forget God;
the hope of the godless shall perish,
14 whose confidence is cut off,
and whose trust is a spider’s web.
15 He leans against his house, but it does not stand;
he holds it fast, but it does not endure.
16 He is full of sap before the sun,
and his shoots spread over his garden.
17 His roots entwine the stone heap;
he looks for a place among the rocks.
18 If he is destroyed from his place,
then it will deny him, saying, ‘I have never seen you.’
19 See, this is the joy of his way,
and out of the dust others will spring.


20 You see that God will not reject the blameless man,
nor take the hand of evildoers.
21 He will yet fill your mouth with laughter,
and your lips with shouting.
22 Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,
and the tent of the wicked will be no more.”




Chapter 9


1 Then Job answered and said:


2 “Truly I know that this is so;
but how can a man be right before God?
3 If one should wish to contend with Him,
he could not answer Him once in a thousand times.
4 He is wise in heart and mighty in strength—
who has hardened himself against Him and prospered?—
5 He who removes mountains, and they do not know it,
when He overturns them in His anger;
6 who shakes the earth out of its place,
so that its pillars tremble;
7 who commands the sun, and it does not rise,
and seals up the stars;
8 who alone stretches out the heavens
and treads upon the waves of the sea;
9 who made the Bear and Orion,
the Pleiades and the chambers of the south;
10 who does great things beyond searching out,
and wonders beyond number.


11 If He passes by me, I do not see Him;
if He moves past, I do not perceive Him.
12 If He snatches away, who can turn Him back?
Who will say to Him, ‘What are You doing?’
13 God will not turn back His anger;
beneath Him the helpers of Rahab bow.


14 How then can I answer Him,
choosing my words with Him?
15 Though I am in the right, I could not answer;
I must plead for mercy to my Judge.
16 If I summoned Him and He answered me,
I would not believe that He was listening to my voice.
17 For He crushes me with a tempest
and multiplies my wounds without cause.
18 He will not allow me to catch my breath,
but fills me with bitterness.
19 If it is a matter of strength—He is mighty!
And if of justice, who can summon Him?
20 Though I am righteous, my own mouth will condemn me;
though I am blameless, He will prove me crooked.
21 I am blameless; I care not for myself;
I despise my life.


22 It is all one; therefore I say,
He destroys the blameless and the wicked.
23 When the scourge brings sudden death,
He mocks at the despair of the innocent.
24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
He covers the faces of its judges—
if it is not He, then who is it?


25 My days are swifter than a runner;
they flee away, they see no good.
26 They pass by like reed boats,
like an eagle swooping down on prey.
27 If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
I will put off my sad face and be cheerful,’
28 I become afraid of all my sorrows,
for I know that You will not hold me innocent.
29 I shall be condemned;
why then do I labor in vain?
30 If I wash myself with snow
and cleanse my hands with lye,
31 yet You will plunge me into a pit,
and my own clothes will abhor me.


32 For He is not a man, as I am, that I might answer Him,
that we should come together in judgment.
33 There is no arbiter between us,
who might lay his hand upon us both.
34 Let Him remove His rod from me,
and let not His terror frighten me.
35 Then I would speak and not fear Him,
for I am not so in myself.”




Chapter 10


1 “My soul loathes my life;
I will give free course to my complaint;
I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
2 I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me;
show me why You contend with me.
3 Does it seem good to You to oppress,
to despise the work of Your hands,
and to shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
4 Do You have eyes of flesh?
Do You see as man sees?
5 Are Your days like the days of a mortal,
or Your years like the days of a man,
6 that You seek out my iniquity
and search for my sin,
7 although You know that I am not wicked,
and there is no one who can deliver from Your hand?


8 Your hands fashioned me and made me;
yet You destroy me altogether.
9 Remember that You have made me like clay;
and will You return me to dust again?
10 Did You not pour me out like milk
and curdle me like cheese?
11 You clothed me with skin and flesh,
and knit me together with bones and sinews.
12 You granted me life and lovingkindness,
and Your care has preserved my spirit.


13 Yet these things You have hidden in Your heart;
I know that this was in Your mind:
14 If I sin, You watch me
and will not acquit me of my guilt.
15 If I am wicked, woe to me!
If I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head,
for I am filled with disgrace
and look on my affliction.
16 And if my head is exalted, You hunt me like a lion,
and again You display Your power against me.
17 You renew Your witnesses against me
and increase Your anger toward me;
relief troops come against me in succession.


18 Why then did You bring me out from the womb?
I should have died and no eye would have seen me.
19 I should have been as though I had not been,
carried from the womb to the grave.
20 Are not my days few? Cease then,
and leave me alone, that I may have a little comfort
21 before I go, never to return,
to the land of darkness and deep shadow,
22 the land of gloom like darkness itself,
of deep shadow and confusion,
where light is as darkness.”


***
Chapter 11


1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
2 “Should not a multitude of words be answered,
and should a man full of talk be justified?
3 Should your babble make men silent,
and when you mock, shall no one shame you?
4 For you have said, ‘My teaching is pure,
and I am clean in your eyes.’
5 But oh that GOD would speak,
and open His lips against you,
6 and that He would declare to you the secrets of wisdom,
for sound wisdom has two sides.
Know then that GOD exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.


7 Can you search out the deep things of GOD?
Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?
8 It is higher than heaven—what can you do?
Deeper than the grave—what can you know?
9 Its measure is longer than the earth,
and broader than the sea.
10 If He passes through and imprisons
and summons to judgment, who can hinder Him?
11 For He knows worthless men;
when He sees iniquity, will He not consider it?
12 But a hollow man will get understanding
when a wild donkey’s colt is born a man.


13 If you prepare your heart,
and stretch out your hands toward Him,
14 if iniquity is in your hand, put it far away,
and let no injustice dwell in your tents.
15 Then surely you will lift up your face without blemish;
you will be steadfast and will not fear.
16 For you will forget your misery;
you will remember it as waters that have passed away.
17 And your life will be brighter than noonday;
darkness will be like the morning.
18 And you will have confidence, because there is hope;
you will look around and lie down in safety.
19 You will lie down, and none will make you afraid,
and many will seek your favor.


20 But the eyes of the wicked will fail;
escape will vanish from them,
and their hope is to breathe their last.”




Chapter 12


1 Then Job answered and said:
2 “Truly, you are the people,
and wisdom will die with you.
3 But I have understanding as well as you;
I am not inferior to you.
And who does not know such things as these?


4 I am a laughingstock to my friends,
I who called on GOD and He answered me—
a just and blameless man, a laughingstock.
5 He who is at ease has contempt for calamity,
thinking it is ready for those whose foot slips.
6 The tents of robbers are at peace,
and those who provoke GOD are secure,
those who bring their god in their hand.


7 But ask the beasts, and they will teach you;
the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you.
8 Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you;
and the fish of the sea will declare to you.
9 Who among all these does not know
that the hand of the LORD has done this?
10 In His hand is the life of every living thing
and the breath of all mankind.


11 Does not the ear test words
as the palate tastes food?
12 Wisdom is with the aged,
and understanding in length of days.


13 With GOD are wisdom and might;
He has counsel and understanding.
14 If He tears down, none can rebuild;
if He shuts a man in, none can open.
15 If He withholds the waters, they dry up;
if He sends them out, they overwhelm the earth.
16 With Him are strength and sound wisdom;
the deceived and the deceiver are His.


17 He leads counselors away stripped,
and makes judges fools.
18 He loosens the bond of kings,
and binds a waistcloth on their loins.
19 He leads priests away stripped,
and overthrows the mighty.
20 He removes speech from trusted men,
and takes away understanding from elders.
21 He pours contempt on nobles,
and loosens the belt of the strong.
22 He reveals deep things out of darkness,
and brings to light the shadow of death.
23 He makes nations great, and destroys them;
He enlarges nations, and leads them away.
24 He takes away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the earth,
and makes them wander in a pathless waste.
25 They grope in the dark without light,
and He makes them stagger like a drunken man.




Chapter 13


1 My eye has seen all this,
my ear has heard and understood it.
2 What you know, I also know;
I am not inferior to you.


3 But I would speak to the Almighty,
and I desire to argue my case with GOD.
4 But you, you smear lies;
you are all worthless physicians.
5 Oh that you would altogether be silent,
and it would be your wisdom!


6 Hear now my argument,
and listen to the pleadings of my lips.
7 Will you speak unrighteously for GOD,
and speak deceitfully for Him?
8 Will you show partiality for Him?
Will you contend for GOD?
9 Will it be well when He searches you out?
Or can you deceive Him as one deceives a man?
10 He will surely reprove you
if in secret you show partiality.
11 Will not His majesty terrify you,
and the dread of Him fall upon you?
12 Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes;
your defenses are defenses of clay.


13 Be silent before me so that I may speak,
and let come on me what may.
14 Why should I take my flesh in my teeth,
and put my life in my hand?
15 Though He slay me, I will wait for Him;
yet I will argue my ways before His face.
16 This also will be my salvation,
for a godless man shall not come before Him.


17 Listen diligently to my words,
and let my declaration enter your ears.
18 Behold now, I have set my case in order;
I know that I will be vindicated.
19 Who is he that will contend with me?
For then I would be silent and die.


20 Only two things do not do to me,
then I will not hide myself from Your face:
21 withdraw Your hand far from me,
and let not Your terror make me afraid.
22 Then call, and I will answer;
or let me speak, and You reply to me.


23 How many are my iniquities and sins?
Make me know my transgression and my sin.
24 Why do You hide Your face,
and count me as Your enemy?
25 Will You frighten a driven leaf,
and pursue dry stubble?
26 For You write bitter things against me,
and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.
27 You put my feet in the stocks,
and watch all my paths;
You mark the soles of my feet,
28 though I waste away like a rotten thing,
like a garment that is moth-eaten.




Chapter 14


1 Man born of woman
is short of days and full of trouble.
2 He comes forth like a flower and withers;
he flees like a shadow and does not endure.
3 Yet You open Your eyes upon such a one
and bring me into judgment with You.
4 Who can bring a clean thing out of the unclean?
No one.
5 Since his days are determined,
the number of his months is with You,
and You have set his limits that he cannot pass,
6 look away from him and let him rest,
until, like a hired man, he finishes his day.


7 For there is hope for a tree,
if it is cut down, it will sprout again,
and its shoots will not cease.
8 Though its root grows old in the earth,
and its stump dies in the ground,
9 yet at the scent of water it will bud
and put forth branches like a young plant.
10 But a man dies and is laid low;
man breathes his last, and where is he?
11 As the waters fail from a lake,
and a river wastes away and dries up,
12 so a man lies down and does not rise.
Till the heavens are no more, he will not awake,
nor be roused out of his sleep.


13 Oh that You would hide me in the grave,
that You would conceal me until Your wrath is past,
that You would appoint me a set time and remember me!
14 If a man dies, shall he live again?
All the days of my hard service I would wait,
till my renewal should come.
15 You would call, and I would answer You;
You would long for the work of Your hands.
16 For then You would number my steps;
You would not keep watch over my sin.
17 My transgression would be sealed up in a bag,
and You would cover over my iniquity.


18 But the mountain falls and crumbles away,
and the rock is removed from its place;
19 the waters wear away the stones,
the torrents wash away the dust of the earth—
so You destroy the hope of man.
20 You overpower him forever, and he passes;
You change his face and send him away.
21 His sons come to honor, and he does not know it;
they are brought low, and he does not perceive it.
22 He feels only the pain of his own body,
and mourns only for himself.”




Chapter 15


1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
2 “Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge,
and fill his belly with the east wind?
3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk,
or with words that do no good?
4 Indeed, you do away with the fear of GOD,
and hinder meditation before GOD.
5 For your iniquity teaches your mouth,
and you choose the tongue of the crafty.
6 Your own mouth condemns you, and not I;
your lips testify against you.


7 Were you the first man born?
Or were you brought forth before the hills?
8 Have you listened in the council of GOD?
And do you limit wisdom to yourself?
9 What do you know that we do not know?
What do you understand that is not with us?
10 Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us,
older than your father.
11 Are the consolations of GOD too small for you,
or the word spoken gently to you?
12 Why does your heart carry you away,
and why do your eyes flash,
13 that you turn your spirit against GOD,
and let such words go out of your mouth?


14 What is man, that he should be pure,
or he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
15 Behold, He puts no trust even in His holy ones,
and the heavens are not pure in His sight;
16 how much less one who is abominable and corrupt,
a man who drinks injustice like water!


17 I will show you, listen to me;
what I have seen I will declare,
18 what wise men have told,
and have not hidden from their fathers,
19 to whom alone the land was given,
and no stranger passed among them.


20 The wicked man writhes in pain all his days,
through all the years stored up for the ruthless.
21 A sound of terror is in his ears;
in prosperity the destroyer comes upon him.
22 He does not believe that he will return from darkness,
and he is marked for the sword.
23 He wanders for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’
He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
24 Distress and anguish terrify him;
they prevail against him like a king ready for battle.
25 For he has stretched out his hand against GOD,
and behaved proudly against the Almighty,
26 running stubbornly against Him
with his thickly bossed shields.


27 Though he has covered his face with fatness,
and gathered fat upon his loins,
28 he dwells in desolate cities,
in houses no one should inhabit,
which are ready to become heaps.
29 He will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure,
nor will his possessions spread over the earth.
30 He will not depart from darkness;
the flame will dry up his shoots,
and by the breath of His mouth he will go away.


31 Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself,
for emptiness will be his reward.
32 It will be fulfilled before his time,
and his branch will not be green.
33 He will shake off his unripe grape like the vine,
and cast off his blossom like the olive tree.
34 For the company of the godless will be barren,
and fire will consume the tents of bribery.
35 They conceive trouble and give birth to evil,
and their womb prepares deceit.”




Chapter 16


1 Then Job answered and said:
2 “I have heard many such things;
miserable comforters are you all.
3 Shall windy words have an end?
Or what provokes you that you answer?
4 I also could speak as you do,
if your soul were in my soul’s place;
I could join words together against you,
and shake my head at you.
5 But I would strengthen you with my mouth,
and the solace of my lips would lessen your pain.


6 Though I speak, my pain is not relieved;
and though I cease, how am I eased?
7 But now He has exhausted me;
You have laid waste all my company.
8 You have shriveled me up—it has become a witness;
my leanness rises up against me, it testifies to my face.
9 His wrath tears and pursues me;
He gnashes His teeth against me;
my adversary sharpens His eyes upon me.
10 They gape at me with their mouths;
they strike me on the cheek with reproach;
they mass themselves together against me.
11 GOD delivers me to the ungodly,
and casts me into the hands of the wicked.


12 I was at ease, and He shattered me;
He seized me by the neck and broke me in pieces.
He has set me up as His target;
13 His archers surround me.
He pierces my kidneys without pity;
He pours out my gall on the ground.
14 He breaks me with breach upon breach;
He runs at me like a warrior.


15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
and thrust my horn into the dust.
16 My face is red with weeping,
and on my eyelids is deep darkness,
17 though there is no violence in my hands,
and my prayer is pure.


18 O earth, do not cover my blood,
and let there be no resting place for my cry.
19 Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven,
and He who testifies for me is on high.
20 My friends scorn me;
my eyes pour out tears to GOD,
21 that one might plead for a man with GOD,
as a man pleads for his neighbor.
22 For when a few years have come,
I shall go the way from which I shall not return.”




Chapter 17


1 My spirit is broken,
my days are extinguished,
the grave is ready for me.
2 Surely mockers are with me,
and my eye dwells on their provocation.


3 Lay down a pledge for me with Yourself;
who is there who will strike hands with me?
4 For You have closed their heart to understanding;
therefore You will not let them triumph.
5 He who denounces friends for a share of the spoil,
the eyes of his children will fail.


6 He has made me a byword of the people,
and I am one in whose face they spit.
7 My eye has grown dim from grief,
and all my limbs are but a shadow.
8 Upright men are appalled at this,
and the innocent stirs himself against the godless.
9 Yet the righteous holds to his way,
and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger.


10 But as for all of you, come again, I pray,
for I shall not find a wise man among you.
11 My days are past, my plans are broken off,
the desires of my heart.
12 They make night into day;
they say, ‘The light is near,’ in the presence of darkness.
13 If I wait for Sheol as my house,
if I spread my bed in darkness,
14 if I call to the pit, ‘You are my father,’
and to the worm, ‘My mother’ or ‘My sister,’
15 where then is my hope?
And who sees any hope for me?
16 Will it go down to the bars of Sheol?
Shall we descend together into the dust?”




Chapter 18


1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2 “How long will you hunt for words?
Consider, and afterward we will speak.
3 Why are we counted as beasts,
and regarded as stupid in your sight?
4 You who tear yourself in anger—
shall the earth be forsaken for your sake,
or the rock be removed from its place?


5 Yes, the light of the wicked is put out,
and the flame of his fire does not shine.
6 The light in his tent is darkened,
and his lamp above him is put out.
7 His vigorous steps are shortened,
and his own counsel casts him down.
8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
and he walks upon a mesh.
9 A snare seizes him by the heel;
a trap takes hold of him.
10 A rope is hidden for him in the ground,
and a trap for him on the path.


11 Terrors frighten him on every side
and chase him at his heels.
12 His strength is famished,
and calamity is ready for his stumbling.
13 It devours the parts of his skin;
the firstborn of death consumes his limbs.
14 He is torn from the security of his tent,
and it marches him to the king of terrors.
15 What was his tent becomes the home of one not his own;
brimstone is scattered on his dwelling.
16 His roots dry up beneath,
and his branches wither above.
17 His memory perishes from the earth,
and he has no name in the street.
18 He is driven from light into darkness,
and chased out of the world.
19 He has neither son nor descendant among his people,
nor any survivor where he sojourned.
20 Those in the west are appalled at his fate,
and those in the east are seized with horror.
21 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked,
and this is the place of him who does not know GOD.”




Chapter 19


1 Then Job answered and said:
2 How long will you torment my soul
and crush me with words?
3 These ten times you have reproached me;
you are not ashamed that you wrong me.
4 And if indeed I have erred,
my error remains lodged with me.
5 If truly you magnify yourselves against me
and argue against me my disgrace,
6 know now that God has wronged me
and has enclosed His net around me.


7 I cry out, “Violence!” but I am not answered;
I cry for help, but there is no justice.
8 He has hemmed up my way so that I cannot pass,
and He has set darkness upon my paths.
9 He has stripped my glory from me
and taken the crown from my head.
10 He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone,
and He has uprooted my hope like a tree.
11 His wrath burns against me,
and He counts me as one of His adversaries.
12 His troops come together and cast up their rampart against me
and encamp around my tent.


13 He has removed my brothers far from me,
and my acquaintances have turned aside from me.
14 My near friends have failed me,
and those who knew me have forgotten me.
15 The sojourners in my house and my maidservants count me as a stranger;
I have become a foreigner in their sight.
16 I call to my servant, and he does not answer;
with my own mouth I must beg him.
17 My breath is offensive to my wife,
and I am loathsome to the sons of my own body.
18 Even young boys despise me;
when I rise, they speak against me.
19 All my intimate friends abhor me,
and those whom I loved have turned against me.


20 My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh,
and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth.
21 Have mercy on me, have mercy on me, O my friends,
for the hand of God has struck me.
22 Why do you persecute me as God does,
and are not satisfied with my flesh?


23 Oh that my words were written!
Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
24 That with an iron stylus and with lead
they were engraved in the rock forever!


25 But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives,
and at the last He will stand upon the dust.
26 And after my skin has been struck off,
yet from my flesh I shall see God,
27 whom I shall see for myself,
and my eyes will behold, and not another.
My heart faints within me.


28 If you say, “How shall we persecute him?”
and, “The root of the matter is found in him,”
29 be afraid of the sword,
for wrath brings the punishments of the sword,
so that you may know there is judgment.




Chapter 20


1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
2 Therefore my thoughts make me return,
and by reason of my haste within me.
3 I hear the reproof that insults me,
and the spirit of my understanding gives me an answer.


4 Do you not know this from of old,
from the placing of man upon the earth,
5 that the triumph of the wicked is short,
and the joy of the godless for a moment?
6 Though his height mounts up to the heavens,
and his head reaches to the clouds,
7 he perishes forever like his own refuse;
those who saw him will say, “Where is he?”
8 He will fly away like a dream, and they will not find him;
he will be chased away like a vision of the night.
9 The eye that saw him will see him no more,
and his place will behold him no longer.


10 His sons will seek the favor of the poor,
and his own hands will restore his wealth.
11 His bones are full of the vigor of his youth,
but it lies down with him in the dust.


12 Though evil tastes sweet in his mouth,
though he hides it under his tongue,
13 though he spares it and does not let it go,
but keeps it within his mouth,
14 yet his food in his stomach is turned;
it becomes the poison of serpents within him.
15 He has swallowed riches, but he will vomit them up;
God will drive them out of his belly.
16 He will suck the poison of serpents;
the tongue of a viper will slay him.
17 He will not look upon the streams,
the flowing rivers of honey and curds.


18 He returns the gain but will not swallow it;
according to the wealth he has gotten, he cannot rejoice.
19 For he has crushed and abandoned the poor;
he has seized a house he did not build.
20 Because he knew no quiet in his belly,
he will not save anything in which he delights.
21 Nothing is left of what he devoured;
therefore his prosperity will not endure.
22 In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be in distress;
the hand of every troublemaker will come upon him.


23 When he is about to fill his belly,
God will send upon him the heat of His wrath
and will rain it upon him while he eats.
24 He flees from an iron weapon;
a bronze bow pierces him through.
25 He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body;
the glittering point comes out from his gall.
Terrors come upon him.


26 Complete darkness is stored up for his treasures;
a fire not blown by man will consume him;
it will devour what is left in his tent.
27 The heavens will reveal his iniquity,
and the earth will rise up against him.
28 The increase of his house will depart;
it will be swept away in the day of His wrath.


29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
and the inheritance appointed to him by God.




Chapter 21


1 Then Job answered and said:
2 Listen carefully to my speech,
and let this be your consolation.
3 Bear with me, and I will speak;
and after I have spoken, you may mock.


4 As for me, is my complaint to man?
And why should my spirit not be impatient?
5 Look at me and be appalled,
and lay your hand upon your mouth.
6 When I remember, I am dismayed,
and trembling seizes my flesh.


7 Why do the wicked live,
grow old,
and become mighty in power?
8 Their offspring are established with them before their face,
and their descendants before their eyes.
9 Their houses are safe from fear,
and the rod of God is not upon them.
10 His bull breeds without fail;
his cow calves and does not miscarry.
11 They send out their little ones like a flock,
and their children dance.
12 They lift up the tambourine and harp,
and rejoice at the sound of the flute.
13 They spend their days in prosperity,
and in a moment go down to Sheol.
14 Yet they say to God, “Depart from us,
for we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.
15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him?
And what profit do we have if we entreat Him?”


16 See, their prosperity is not in their own hand;
the counsel of the wicked is far from me.


17 How often is the lamp of the wicked put out?
How often does their calamity come upon them?
Does He distribute sorrows in His anger?
18 Are they as straw before the wind,
and as chaff that the storm carries away?
19 You say, “God stores up his iniquity for his sons.”
Let Him repay him, that he may know it.
20 Let his own eyes see his destruction,
and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
21 For what does he care for his house after him,
when the number of his months is cut off?


22 Will any teach knowledge to God,
since He judges those who are on high?
23 One dies in full strength,
being wholly at ease and secure;
24 his sides full of milk,
and the marrow of his bones moist.
25 Another dies in bitterness of soul,
and never eats with pleasure.
26 Together they lie down in the dust,
and worms cover them.


27 Look, I know your thoughts,
and the devices with which you wrong me.
28 For you say, “Where is the house of the prince?
And where is the tent in which the wicked lived?”
29 Have you not asked those who travel the roads?
And do you not recognize their witnesses,
30 that the wicked is spared in the day of calamity,
that he is delivered in the day of wrath?
31 Who declares his way to his face?
And who repays him for what he has done?
32 He is carried to the grave,
and men keep watch over his tomb.
33 The clods of the valley are sweet to him;
all men follow after him,
and those who went before are without number.


34 How then do you comfort me with emptiness,
when your answers remain falsehood?




Chapter 22


1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
2 Can a man be of use to God,
 for the wise man is useful only to himself?
3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous,
 or gain if you make your way blameless?
4 Is it because of your fear of Him that He reproves you,
 that He enters into judgment with you?
5 Is not your wickedness great,
 and are not your iniquities without end?
6 For you have taken pledges from your brothers without cause,
 and stripped the naked of their clothing.
7 You have not given water to the weary to drink,
 and you have withheld bread from the hungry.
8 But the man of power—his is the land,
 and the honored man dwells in it.
9 You have sent widows away empty,
 and the arms of the fatherless have been crushed.
10 Therefore snares are all around you,
 and sudden dread terrifies you,
11 or darkness, so that you cannot see,
 and a flood of waters covers you.


12 Is not God in the height of the heavens?
 And you see that the lofty stars—how high they are.
13 And you say, “What does God know?
 Can He judge through deep darkness?
14 Clouds are a covering to Him so that He cannot see,
 and He walks on the vault of heaven.”
15 Will you keep to the ancient path
 that wicked men have trod,
16 who were snatched away before their time,
 whose foundation was washed away by a torrent,
17 who said to God, “Depart from us,”
 and, “What can the Almighty do to us?”
18 Yet He filled their houses with good things,
 but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
19 The righteous see it and are glad,
 and the innocent mock them,
20 saying, “Surely our adversaries are cut off,
 and fire has consumed their abundance.”


21 Acquaint yourself now with Him, and be at peace;
 thereby good will come to you.
22 Receive instruction, I pray you, from His mouth,
 and lay up His words in your heart.
23 If you return to the Almighty you will be restored;
 if you remove unrighteousness far from your tents,
24 and place your gold in the dust,
 and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the ravines,
25 then the Almighty will be your gold
 and your precious silver.
26 For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty
 and lift up your face to God.
27 You will pray to Him, and He will hear you;
 and you will fulfill your vows.
28 You will decree a matter, and it will stand for you;
 and light will shine on your ways.
29 When men are cast down, you will say, “Lift them up,”
 and He will save the humble.
30 He will deliver even the one who is not innocent;
 he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.




Chapter 23


1 Then Job answered and said,
2 Even today my complaint is bitter;
 my hand is heavy on account of my groaning.
3 Oh that I knew where I might find Him,
 that I might come to His seat!
4 I would set my case in order before Him
 and fill my mouth with arguments.
5 I would know the words He would answer me
 and understand what He would say to me.
6 Would He contend with me by the greatness of His power?
 No, surely He would give heed to me.
7 There an upright man could reason with Him,
 and I would be delivered forever from my Judge.


8 I go forward, but He is not there,
 and backward, but I do not perceive Him;
9 on the left when He is working, but I cannot behold Him;
 He turns to the right, but I do not see Him.
10 But He knows the way that I take;
 when He has tested me, I will come out as gold.
11 My foot has held fast to His steps;
 I have kept His way and have not turned aside.
12 I have not departed from the command of His lips;
 I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my portion.


13 But He is of one mind, and who can turn Him?
 What His soul desires, that He does.
14 For He will complete what is appointed for me,
 and many such things are with Him.
15 Therefore I am terrified before Him;
 when I consider, I fear Him.
16 For God has made my heart faint,
 and the Almighty has terrified me,
17 yet I am not silenced because of the darkness,
 nor because thick darkness covers my face.




Chapter 24


1 Why are times not stored up by the Almighty,
and why do those who know Him not see His days?
2 They move boundary stones;
they seize flocks and pasture them.
3 They drive away the donkey of the fatherless;
they take the widow’s ox as a pledge.
4 They thrust the needy off the road;
the poor of the land must hide together.
5 Look, like wild donkeys in the wilderness,
they go out in their labor, seeking prey;
the desert yields food for them and for their children.
6 They reap in a field that is not theirs,
and they glean the vineyard of the wicked.
7 They spend the night naked, without clothing,
and have no covering in the cold.
8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
and embrace the rock for lack of shelter.
9 They snatch the fatherless from the breast,
and take a pledge against the poor.
10 They go about naked, without clothing,
and hungry, they carry the sheaves.
11 They press out oil within their terraces;
they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.
12 From the city men groan,
and the soul of the wounded cries out,
yet GOD charges no one with wrongdoing.


13 These are among those who rebel against the light;
they do not acknowledge its ways,
and they do not remain in its paths.
14 The murderer rises at dawn;
he kills the poor and needy,
and in the night he is like a thief.
15 The eye of the adulterer waits for twilight,
saying, ‘No eye will see me,’
and he puts a cover on his face.
16 They dig through houses in the dark;
by day they shut themselves in;
they do not know the light.
17 For morning is to all of them as deep darkness,
for they are familiar with the terrors of deep darkness.


18 He is swift on the face of the waters;
their portion in the land is cursed;
he does not turn toward the way of the vineyards.
19 Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters;
so Sheol snatches those who sin.
20 The womb forgets him;
the worm feeds sweetly on him;
he is no longer remembered,
and wickedness is broken like a tree.
21 He preys on the barren who does not bear,
and does no good to the widow.
22 Yet He draws the mighty away by His power;
He rises up, and no man is sure of life.
23 He gives him security, and he is supported;
yet His eyes are on their ways.
24 They are exalted a little while, then they are gone;
they are brought low and gathered in like all others;
they are cut off like the tops of ears of grain.
25 And if this is not so, who can prove me a liar,
and make my speech worthless?”




Chapter 25


1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2 “Dominion and fear are with Him;
He makes peace in His high places.
3 Is there any number to His armies?
And upon whom does His light not rise?
4 How then can man be righteous with GOD?
Or how can one born of woman be pure?
5 Look, even the moon does not shine brightly,
and the stars are not pure in His eyes;
6 how much less man, a maggot,
and the son of man, a worm.”




Chapter 26


1 Then Job answered and said:


2 “How you have helped one without strength,
saved the arm that has no power!
3 How you have counseled one without wisdom,
and made abundant sound knowledge known!
4 With whose help have you uttered words,
and whose breath came forth from you?


5 The shades tremble beneath the waters
and those who dwell in them.
6 Sheol is naked before Him,
and Abaddon has no covering.
7 He stretches out the north over emptiness,
He hangs the earth on nothing.
8 He binds up the waters in His thick clouds,
and the cloud is not torn under them.
9 He covers the face of His throne,
and spreads His cloud over it.
10 He has inscribed a boundary on the face of the waters,
at the limit of light and darkness.
11 The pillars of heaven tremble,
and are astounded at His rebuke.
12 By His power He stirs the sea,
and by His understanding He shatters Rahab.
13 By His breath the heavens are cleared;
His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
14 Look, these are only the fringes of His ways,
and how faint is the whisper we hear of Him!
But the thunder of His power who can understand?”




Chapter 27


1 Job continued his discourse and said:
2 “As God lives, who has taken away my right,
and the Almighty, who has embittered my soul,
3 so long as my breath is in me
and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,
4 my lips will not speak falsehood,
and my tongue will not utter deceit.
5 Far be it from me to say you are right;
until I die, I will not put away my integrity from me.
6 I hold fast to my righteousness and will not let it go;
my heart does not reproach me for any of my days.
7 Let my enemy be as the wicked,
and he who rises against me as the unrighteous.
8 For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts him off,
when the LORD requires his life?
9 Will God hear his cry
when distress comes upon him?
10 Will he take delight in the Almighty?
Will he call upon God at all times?
11 I will teach you about the hand of God;
I will not conceal what is with the Almighty.
12 Look, all of you have seen it yourselves;
so why is this that you are altogether vain?


13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
and the inheritance that tyrants receive from the Almighty:
14 If his sons multiply, the sword awaits them,
and his offspring will not have enough to eat.
15 Those who survive him will be buried by the plague,
and his widows will not weep.
16 Though he pile up silver like dust
and prepare garments like clay,
17 he may prepare it, but the righteous will wear it,
and the innocent will divide the silver.
18 He builds his house like a moth,
like a hut made by a watchman.
19 He lies down rich, but it will not last;
he opens his eyes, and it is gone.
20 Terrors overtake him like a flood;
a storm wind steals him away in the night.
21 The east wind lifts him up, and he is gone;
it sweeps him out of his place.
22 It hurls itself at him without pity;
he flees desperately from its power.
23 It claps its hands at him
and hisses him out of his place.”




Chapter 28


1 “Surely there is a mine for silver,
and a place where gold is refined.
2 Iron is taken out of the dust,
and copper is smelted from stone.
3 Man puts an end to darkness
and searches out to the farthest limits
the stones hidden in gloom and deep shadow.
4 He breaks open a shaft away from where men dwell;
they are forgotten by the traveler.
They hang and swing far from mankind.
5 As for the earth, from it comes bread,
yet beneath it is turned up as if by fire.
6 Its stones are the place of sapphires,
and it contains dust of gold.
7 A path no bird of prey knows,
and the falcon’s eye has not seen it.
8 The proud beasts have not trodden it;
the lion has not passed over it.
9 Man stretches out his hand against the flinty rock;
he overturns mountains at their roots.
10 He cuts channels through the rocks,
and his eye sees every precious thing.
11 He dams up streams so they do not drip,
and what is hidden he brings to light.


12 But wisdom—where can it be found,
and where is the place of understanding?
13 Man does not know its value,
nor is it found in the land of the living.
14 The deep says, “It is not in me,”
and the sea says, “It is not with me.”
15 It cannot be bought with gold,
nor can silver be weighed out for its price.
16 It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir,
in precious onyx or sapphire.
17 Gold or crystal cannot compare with it,
nor can it be exchanged for a vessel of fine gold.
18 Coral and crystal are not worth mentioning;
the price of wisdom is above pearls.
19 The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it;
it cannot be valued in pure gold.


20 So from where does wisdom come,
and where is the place of understanding?
21 It is hidden from the eyes of all living,
and concealed from the birds of the heavens.
22 Abaddon and Death say,
“We have heard a report of it with our ears.”
23 God understands its way,
and He knows its place.
24 For He looks to the ends of the earth
and sees everything under the heavens.
25 When He gave the wind its weight
and apportioned the waters by measure,
26 when He made a decree for the rain
and a path for the lightning of thunder,
27 then He saw it and declared it;
He established it and searched it out.
28 And He said to man,
“Look, the fear of the LORD—that is wisdom,
and to turn from evil is understanding.”




Chapter 29


1 Job again took up his discourse and said:
2 “Oh, that I were as in months past,
as in the days when God guarded me,
3 when His lamp shone over my head,
and by His light I walked through darkness;
4 as I was in the days of my prime,
when God’s friendship rested on my tent,
5 when the Almighty was still with me,
and my children were around me,
6 when my steps were washed with cream,
and the rock poured out streams of oil for me.


7 When I went out to the gate of the city,
when I took my seat in the square,
8 young men saw me and withdrew,
and the aged rose and stood;
9 princes restrained their words
and laid a hand over their mouths;
10 the voice of nobles was hushed,
and their tongue clung to the roof of their mouth.
11 For the ear that heard me blessed me,
and the eye that saw me approved,
12 because I delivered the poor who cried for help,
and the fatherless who had none to assist him.
13 The blessing of the one who was perishing came upon me,
and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
14 I clothed myself with righteousness, and it clothed me;
my justice was like a robe and a turban.
15 I was eyes to the blind
and feet to the lame.
16 I was a father to the needy,
and I examined the case of the stranger.
17 I broke the fangs of the wicked
and snatched the prey from his teeth.


18 Then I said, ‘I will die in my nest,
and I will multiply my days like the sand.
19 My root is spread out to the waters,
and the dew lies all night on my branch.
20 My glory is fresh in me,
and my bow is renewed in my hand.’


21 They listened to me and waited,
and kept silence for my counsel.
22 After I spoke, they did not speak again,
and my speech dropped on them like dew.
23 They waited for me as for the rain,
and opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain.
24 I smiled on them when they had no confidence,
and they did not cast down the light of my face.
25 I chose their way and sat as their chief;
I dwelled as a king among the troops,
as one who comforts mourners.”




Chapter 30


1 “But now those younger than I mock me,
whose fathers I would have refused
to set with the dogs of my flock.
2 Indeed, the strength of their hands—what use was it to me?
Their vigor had perished.
3 Through want and hunger they were gaunt,
they gnawed the dry ground in a parched wasteland,
4 they plucked salt herbs by the bushes,
and the roots of broom trees were their food.
5 They were driven out from the midst of men;
they shouted after them as after a thief,
6 so that they dwelled in the clefts of ravines,
in holes of the earth and in the rocks.
7 Among the bushes they brayed;
under the nettles they huddled together.
8 A senseless, nameless brood,
they were scourged out of the land.


9 And now I have become their mocking song;
I am a byword to them.
10 They detest me; they keep far from me,
and do not refrain from spitting in my face.
11 Because He has loosed my cord and afflicted me,
they cast off restraint in my presence.
12 On my right hand the rabble rise;
they push aside my feet
and cast up against me their destructive ways.
13 They tear up my path;
they profit from my ruin—
no one restrains them.
14 They come as through a wide breach;
amid the crash they roll on.


15 Terrors are turned upon me;
my dignity is chased away like the wind,
and my well-being has passed like a cloud.
16 And now my life pours out within me;
days of affliction seize me.
17 The night pierces my bones within me,
and my gnawing pains never rest.
18 By great force my garment is disfigured;
it binds me about like the collar of my tunic.
19 He has cast me into the dirt,
and I am compared to dust and ashes.


20 I cry to You, but You do not answer me;
I stand, and You only look at me.
21 You have turned cruel to me;
with the might of Your hand You persecute me.
22 You lift me up to the wind and make me ride it,
and You dissolve me in the storm.
23 For I know that You will bring me to death,
and to the house appointed for all the living.


24 Surely no man will stretch out his hand to strike a heap
when in his calamity he cries for help.
25 Did I not weep for him whose day was hard?
Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
26 Yet when I looked for good, evil came;
and when I waited for light, darkness came.
27 My inward parts are in turmoil and never rest;
days of affliction confront me.
28 I go about darkened, but not by the sun;
I rise in the assembly and cry for help.
29 I have become a brother of jackals
and a companion of ostriches.
30 My skin turns black and peels from me;
my bones burn with fever.
31 My harp has turned to mourning,
and my flute to the voice of those who weep.”




Chapter 31


1 “I made a covenant with my eyes;
how then could I gaze upon a virgin?
2 For what would be my portion from GOD above,
and my inheritance from the Almighty on high?
3 Is not calamity for the wicked,
and disaster for the workers of iniquity?
4 Does He not see my ways
and count all my steps?


5 If I have walked with falsehood,
and my foot has hurried to deceit,
6 let Him weigh me in a just balance,
and GOD will know my integrity.
7 If my steps have turned from the way,
or my heart has gone after my eyes,
or a stain has clung to my hands,
8 then let me sow and another eat,
and let what grows for me be uprooted.


9 If my heart has been enticed by a woman,
or I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door,
10 then let my wife grind for another,
and let others lie with her.
11 For that would be a shameful act,
a crime for judges to punish;
12 for it is a fire that burns to Abaddon,
and it would consume all my harvest.


13 If I have rejected the cause of my servant or my maid
when they brought a complaint against me,
14 what then shall I do when GOD rises up?
And when He calls me to account, what shall I answer Him?
15 Did not He who made me in the womb make him?
And did not the same One form us in the belly?


16 If I have withheld the desires of the poor,
or caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
17 or eaten my morsel alone
so that the fatherless did not eat from it—
18 no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,
and from my mother’s womb I guided the widow—
19 if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing
or the poor without covering,
20 if his loins have not blessed me
and he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep,
21 if I have lifted my hand against the fatherless
because I saw my help in the gate,
22 then let my shoulder fall from its joint,
and my arm be broken from the bone.
23 For destruction from GOD was a terror to me,
and because of His majesty I could not do such things.


24 If I have made gold my trust
or called fine gold my confidence,
25 if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great
and my hand had gained much,
26 if I have looked at the sun when it shone
or the moon moving in splendor,
27 and my heart was secretly enticed
and my hand kissed my mouth,
28 this also would be a crime for judges to punish,
for I would have denied GOD above.


29 If I have rejoiced at the ruin of him who hated me,
or exulted when evil found him—
30 I did not let my mouth sin
by asking for his life with a curse—
31 if the men of my tent have not said,
‘Who is there that has not been filled with his meat?’
32 the sojourner did not lodge in the street,
I opened my doors to the traveler.


33 If I have covered my transgressions like Adam,
hiding my iniquity in my bosom,
34 because I feared a great multitude
and the contempt of families terrified me,
so that I kept silent and did not go outdoors—


35 Oh that I had someone to hear me!
Look, here is my signature—let the Almighty answer me!
And let my accuser write his indictment.
36 Surely I would carry it on my shoulder;
I would bind it to me as a crown.
37 I would give Him an account of all my steps;
like a prince I would approach Him.


38 If my land cries out against me,
or its furrows weep together,
39 if I have eaten its yield without paying
or caused the lives of its owners to breathe out their last,
40 let thorns grow instead of wheat,
and weeds instead of barley.”




Chapter 32


1 So these three men ceased answering Job,
because he was righteous in his own eyes.
2 Then the anger of Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite,
of the family of Ram, burned against Job;
his anger burned because he justified himself rather than GOD.
3 And his anger burned against his three friends as well,
because they had found no answer
and yet had condemned Job.
4 Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job
because they were older than he.
5 But when Elihu saw that there was no answer
in the mouth of the three men,
his anger burned.


6 Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite answered and said:
“I am young in years,
and you are old;
therefore I was timid and afraid
to declare my opinion to you.
7 I said, ‘Let days speak,
and many years teach wisdom.’
8 But it is the spirit in man,
the breath of the Almighty, that gives understanding.
9 It is not the great in years who are wise,
nor the aged who understand justice.
10 Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me;
I also will declare my knowledge.’
11 Look, I waited for your words,
I listened for your reasoning,
while you searched out what to say.
12 And I paid close attention to you;
but there was none who proved Job wrong,
none who answered his words.
13 Do not say, ‘We have found wisdom;
GOD will defeat him, not man.’
14 But he has not directed his argument against me,
nor will I answer him with your speeches.


15 They are dismayed; they answer no more;
words have deserted them.
16 And shall I wait because they do not speak,
because they stand still and answer no longer?
17 I also will answer my share;
I also will declare my knowledge.
18 For I am full of words;
the spirit within me presses me.
19 Look, my belly is like wine that has no vent;
like new wineskins it is ready to burst.
20 I must speak, that I may find relief;
I must open my lips and answer.
21 Let me not show partiality to any man,
nor flatter any man.
22 For I do not know how to flatter;
otherwise my Maker would soon take me away.”




Chapter 33


1 “But now, Job, hear my speech,
and listen to all my words.
2 Look, I have opened my mouth;
my tongue speaks in my mouth.
3 My words come from an upright heart,
and my lips sincerely declare what they know.
4 The Spirit of GOD has made me,
and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
5 Answer me if you can;
set your words in order before me; take your stand.
6 Look, I am before you like you are;
I too was pinched off from a piece of clay.
7 See, no fear of me will terrify you,
nor will my pressure be heavy upon you.
8 Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
and I have heard the sound of your words, saying,
9 ‘I am pure, without transgression;
I am clean, and there is no guilt in me.
10 Yet He finds reasons against me;
He counts me as His enemy.
11 He puts my feet in the stocks;
He watches all my paths.’
12 Surely this is not right—I will answer you,
for GOD is greater than man.
13 Why do you contend with Him,
saying He gives no answer concerning His matters?
14 For GOD speaks in one way, and in another,
yet man does not perceive it.
15 In a dream, a vision of the night,
when deep sleep falls upon men
as they slumber on their beds,
16 then He opens the ears of men
and seals their instruction,
17 to turn man from his deeds
and keep pride from him,
18 to spare his soul from the pit,
and his life from passing by the sword.
19 Or he is chastened with pain on his bed,
and with continual strife in his bones,
20 so that his life loathes bread,
and his soul his favorite food.
21 His flesh wastes away so that it cannot be seen,
and his bones, once hidden, stick out.
22 His soul draws near the pit,
and his life to those who bring death.
23 If there is for him an angel,
a mediator, one out of a thousand,
to declare to man what is right for him,
24 then He is gracious to him and says,
‘Deliver him from going down to the pit;
I have found a ransom.’
25 His flesh shall be fresher than in youth;
he shall return to the days of his vigor.
26 He shall pray to GOD, and He will accept him;
he shall see His face with joy,
and He restores to man his righteousness.
27 He will sing before men and say,
‘I sinned and perverted what was right,
and it was not repaid to me.
28 He redeemed my soul from passing into the pit,
and my life sees the light.’
29 Look, GOD does all these things
twice, even three times with a man,
30 to bring back his soul from the pit,
that he may be lighted with the light of life.
31 Pay attention, Job, listen to me;
be silent, and I will speak.
32 If you have anything to say, answer me;
speak, for I desire to justify you.
33 If not, then listen to me;
be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”




Chapter 34


1 Hear my words, you wise men; and give ear to me, you men of understanding.
2 For the ear tests words, as the palate tastes food.
3 Let us choose what is right for ourselves; let us know among ourselves what is good.
4 For Job has said, “I am righteous, and God has taken away my right;
5 though I am in the right, I am counted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I have no transgression.”
6 Who is a man like Job, who drinks derision like water,
7 who travels with evildoers and walks with the wicked?
8 For he has said, “A man gains nothing by delighting in God.”


9 Therefore, you men of understanding, hear me: far be it from God to do wrong, and from the Almighty to pervert justice.
10 For He repays a man according to his work, and makes him find according to his ways.
11 Indeed, God will not do wickedly, nor will the Almighty pervert justice.
12 Who gave Him charge over the earth? Or who laid the whole world under His authority?
13 If He should set His heart to it, and gather to Himself His spirit and His breath,
14 all flesh would perish together, and man would return to dust.


15 If you have understanding, hear this; listen to the sound of my words.
16 Shall one who hates justice govern? And will you condemn the righteous God?
17 Does He say to a king, “Rash one”? And to nobles, “Wicked one”?
18 He does not take away His eyes from the mighty; He is not partial to princes; for they are all the work of His hands.
19 In a moment they die, at midnight; the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are removed without human hand.


20 His eyes are on their ways, and He sees all their steps.
21 There is no darkness, nor the shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
22 For He will not appoint a time to man for judgment, saying, “Come here, that I may judge you.”
23 He breaks in pieces the mighty without inquiry, and sets others in their place.
24 Therefore He takes note of their ways; He overthrows them in the night, and they are crushed.
25 He strikes them as wicked men in open sight, because they turned aside from following Him, and would not consider any of His ways.
26 So they caused the cry of the poor to come before Him; He hears the cry of the afflicted.
27 When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? And when He hides His face, who then can behold Him, whether it is against a nation or a man?
28 That he should not rule as a godless man, nor be an ensnarer of the people.


29 Anyone may say, “I have endured chastening; I will not offend anymore;
30 teach me what I do not see; if I have done wrong, I will not do it again.”
31 Would you then speakwhat you know, since you reject it? You must choose, not I; therefore say what you know.
32 Men of understanding will tell me, and a wise man who hears me will say:
33 “Job speaks without knowledge, and his words lack insight.”
34 Would that Job were tried to the utmost, because his answers are like those of wicked men!
35 For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.




Chapter 35


1 Elihu answered and said:
2 Do you think this is just, that you say, “My righteousness is more than God’s”?
3 For you ask, “What advantage is it to You? What do I gain more than if I had sinned?”
4 I will answer you, and your companions with you.
5 Look up to the heavens and see; look at the skies, which are higher than you.
6 If you have sinned, what do you do against Him? And if your transgressions are many, what do you do to Him?
7 If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?
8 Your wickedness only affects a man like yourself, and your righteousness a son of man.


9 Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; they call for help because of the power of the mighty.
10 But no one says, “Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
11 who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?”
12 There they cry, but He gives no answer, because of the pride of evil men.
13 Surely God will not hear vanity, nor will the Almighty regard it.
14 When you say you do not see Him — the case is before Him, so wait for Him.
15 And now, because there is no one, He has appointed His anger; yet He does not consider great wickedness.
16 But you open your mouth in vanity; you multiply words without knowledge.




Chapter 36


1 Elihu continued and said:
2 Wait a little, and I will show you — there are yet words to say on God’s behalf.
3 I will draw my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
4 For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
5 Look — God is mighty, yet He despises no one; He is mighty in power of understanding.
6 He does not preserve the life of the wicked, but gives justice to the afflicted.
7 He does not remove His eyes from the righteous; He exalts them with kings, and they dwell in honor forever.
8 But if someone is bound in chains, held fast in cords of affliction,
9 he tells them what they have done — that they have sinned arrogantly;
10 he makes them listen to correction, and commands that they turn from iniquity.
11 If they obey and serve Him, they will spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasure.
12 But if they do not obey, then they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.
13 The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when He binds them, they do not cry for help.
14 They die in their youth, among the revelers and prostitutes.
15 Yet He rescues those who suffer in their affliction; He speaks to them in their distress.
16 He draws you from the jaws of distress into a broad place free from restriction, to a table spread with abundance.
17 Yet you are full of judgment due to your wickedness; wrath and justice seize you.
18 Beware that riches do not entice you, and that a large bribe does not turn you aside.
19 Can your wealth keep you from distress, or all your mighty efforts from hard times?
20 Do not long for the night, when people vanish from their homes.
21 Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction.


22 Look — God is exalted by His power; who is a teacher like Him?
23 Who has prescribed His way for Him, or said, “You have done wrong”?
24 Remember to praise His work, of which men have sung.
25 All mankind has looked on it; men gaze on it from afar.
26 How great is God — beyond our understanding! The number of His years is unsearchable.


27 He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain for the streams;
28 the clouds pour down their moisture, and abundant showers fall on man.
29 Who can understand the spreading of clouds, or the thunder from His pavilion?
30 Look — He spreads His lightning about Him, and covers the depths of the sea.
31 This is how He governs — by His power He provides food in abundance.
32 He fills His hands with lightning, and commands it to strike its mark.
33 His thunder proclaims it; even the cattle tell of the storm’s approach.




Chapter 37


1 At this my heart trembles
 and leaps out of its place.
2 Listen closely to the rumble of His voice,
 and the sound that comes from His mouth.
3 He lets it loose under all the heavens,
 and His lightning to the ends of the earth.
4 After it a roar sounds;
 He thunders with His majestic voice,
 and He does not restrain the flashes
 when His voice is heard.
5 God thunders wondrously with His voice;
 He does great things that we cannot understand.


6 For He says to the snow, “Fall on the earth,”
 and to the downpour of rain, “Become mighty.”
7 He seals the hand of every man,
 so that all men may know His work.
8 Then the beast goes into its den
 and stays in its lair.
9 The storm-wind comes from its chamber,
 and the cold from the scattering winds.
10 By the breath of God the ice is formed,
 and the wide waters are frozen tight.
11 He loads the thick cloud with moisture;
 His lightning scatters the cloud.
12 It turns around by His guidance,
 to perform all that He commands them
 on the face of the inhabited world.
13 Whether as a rod, or for His land,
 or for loyal love, He causes it to happen.


14 Listen to this, Job;
 stand still and consider the wonders of God.
15 Do you know how God commands them
 and causes His lightning to flash?
16 Do you know the balancing of the clouds,
 the wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?
17 You whose garments are hot
 when the land is still because of the south wind,
18 can you spread out the sky with Him,
 as strong as a cast metal mirror?


19 Teach us what we should say to Him;
 we cannot arrange our words because of darkness.
20 Should it be told Him that I want to speak?
 Would a man say such a thing and be swallowed up?
21 Now men cannot look at the bright light
 when it is in the clouds,
 when the wind has passed and cleared them.
22 From the north comes a golden radiance;
 around God is awesome majesty.
23 The Almighty — we cannot find Him out;
 He is exalted in power;
 He will not violate justice and great righteousness.
24 Therefore men fear Him;
 He does not regard any who are wise in their own heart.




Chapter 38


1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
2 Who is this that obscures my counsel with words without knowledge?
3 Gird up your loins like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.
4 Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.
5 Who determined its measurements — surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?
6 On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone,
7 when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
8 Or who shut in the sea with doors, when it burst out from the womb,
9 when I made the cloud its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band,
10 and prescribed limits for it, and set bars and doors,
11 and said, “This far you shall come, but no farther; here shall your proud waves stop”?


12 Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place,
13 that it might take hold of the edges of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?
14 It changes as clay under a seal; and its features stand out like a garment.
15 From the wicked their light is withheld, and the uplifted arm is broken.
16 Have you entered into the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the deep?
17 Have the gates of death been revealed to you, or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
18 Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Declare, if you know it all.
19 Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and where is the place of darkness,
20 that you may take it to its territory, and that you may know the paths to its home?
21 Surely you know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!
22 Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
23 which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war?
24 By what way is light distributed, or the east wind scattered over the earth?
25 Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain, and a way for the thunderbolt,
26 to bring rain on a land where there is no man, on the desert in which there is no man,
27 to satisfy the waste and desolate land, and to cause the bud of tender grass to spring forth?
28 Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew?
29 From whose womb comes the ice? And the frost of heaven, who gives it birth?
30 The waters become hard like stone, and the surface of the deep is frozen.
31 Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion?
32 Can you lead forth a constellation in its season, or guide the Bear with its cubs?
33 Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule on the earth?
34 Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover you?
35 Can you send forth the lightning, that they may go, and say to you, “Here we are”?
36 Who has put wisdom in the inward parts, or given understanding to the mind?
37 Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens,
38 when the dust runs into a mass and the clods stick fast together?
39 Can you hunt the prey for the lioness, or satisfy the young lions when they crouch in their dens?
40 Who provides for the raven its prey, when its young ones cry to God, and wander for lack of food?




Chapter 39


1 Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth, or mark when the hinds calve?
2 Can you number the months that they fulfill, or know when they bring forth?
3 They crouch down, they bring out their young, they send forth their pangs, they cast forth their offspring.
4 Their young become strong, they grow up in the open field, they go forth, yet do not return to them.


5 Who set free the wild donkey? Who loosened his bonds?
6 Whose house I made the wilderness, and salt land his pasture.
7 He laughs at the tumult of the city; he does not hear the shouts of the driver.
8 He ranges the mountains as his pasture and searches after every green thing.


9 Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he spend the night at your crib?
10 Can you bind him in the furrow with a harness, or will he harrow the valleys after you?
11 Will you trust him because his strength is great, or will you leave to him your labor?
12 Will you believe him that he will bring home your seed, and gather it to your threshing floor?


13 The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but are her feathers and plumage like the stork’s?
14 She leaves her eggs on the ground and warms them in the dust.
15 She forgets that a foot may crush them, or that wild beasts may trample them.
16 She treats her young harshly, as though they were not hers; though her labor is in vain, she has no fear,
 because God has deprived her of wisdom and has not given her understanding.
17 When she lifts herself on high, she laughs at the horse and his rider.


18 Do you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with a flowing mane?
19 Do you lead him like a locust? His majestic snorting is terrifying.
20 He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons.
21 He laughs at fear and is not frightened; he does not turn back from the sword.
22 He quivers at the blast of the trumpet; he hears the clash of the javelin and the spear.
23 He says among the trumpets, “Ha!” He smells the battle from afar, the thunder of captains and shouting.


24 Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, stretching her wings toward the south?
25 Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes her nest on high?
26 She dwells and abides on the rock, on the crag of the cliff, a stronghold.
27 From there she spies out the prey; her eyes behold it from far away.
28 Her young also suck up blood; where the slain are, there she is.




Chapter 40


1 The LORD answered Job and said,
2 Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty?
 Let him who argues with God answer it.


3 Job answered the LORD and said,
4 Look, I am insignificant—what can I reply to you?
 I lay my hand over my mouth.
5 I have spoken once, and I will not answer;
 twice, but I will say no more.


6 Then the LORD answered Job from the storm and said,
7 Gird up your loins like a man;
 I will question you, and you will inform me.
8 Will you indeed annul my justice?
 Will you condemn me so that you may be right?
9 Do you have an arm like God’s,
 or can you thunder with a voice like his?
10 Adorn yourself now with majesty and exaltation,
 and clothe yourself with honor and splendor.
11 Pour out the overflowings of your anger,
 and look on every proud man and bring him low.
12 Look on every proud man and humble him,
 and tread down the wicked where they stand.
13 Hide them together in the dust;
 bind their faces in secret.
14 Then I, even I, will acknowledge to you
 that your own right hand can save you.


15 Look now at Behemoth, which I made as I made you;
 he eats grass like the ox.
16 Look, his strength is in his loins,
 and his power in the muscles of his belly.
17 He stiffens his tail like a cedar;
 the sinews of his thighs are knit together.
18 His bones are tubes of bronze;
 his limbs are like bars of iron.
19 He is the first of the ways of God;
 only his Maker can draw near with a sword.
20 For the mountains yield food for him,
 and all the beasts of the field play there.
21 He lies under the lotus plants,
 hidden in the reeds and the marsh.
22 The lotus plants cover him with their shade;
 the poplars of the river surround him.
23 Look, if the river rages, he is not alarmed;
 he is confident, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.
24 Shall anyone capture him with open eyes,
 or pierce his nose with snares?




Chapter 41


1 Can you draw Leviathan out with a hook, or press down his tongue with a cord?
2 Can you put a rope in his nose, or pierce his jaw with a hook?
3 Will he make many pleas to you? Will he speak softly to you?
4 Will he make a covenant with you, to become your servant forever?
5 Will you play with him like a bird, or will you bind him for your maidens?
6 Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him among the merchants?
7 Can you fill his skin with harpoons, or his head with fishing spears?
8 Lay your hand on him; think of the battle; you will not do it again.
9 See how his hope is false; even at his sight he is despised.
10 No man is so fierce that he dares to stir him up; who then is able to stand before me?
11 Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine.
12 I will not be quiet concerning his limbs, or his mighty strength, or his graceful parts.
13 Who can uncover the face of his garment? Who can come near to his double bridle?
14 Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror.
15 His back is made of rows of shields, tightly sealed together.
16 Each is so close to the next that no wind can pass between them;
17 they are joined so that one cannot part them.
18 His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.
19 Flames pour forth from his mouth; burning coals leap forth.
20 Smoke goes out of his nostrils, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.
21 His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.
22 His neck is strong under him, and his heart is firm as a stone.
23 When he raises himself up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat in horror.
24 The sword that reaches him cannot hold, nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin.
25 He considers iron like straw, and bronze like rotten wood.
26 The arrow cannot make him flee; for him, sling stones are turned to stubble.
27 Clubs are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rattle of javelins.
28 His undersides are like sharp potsherds; he spreads out like a threshing sledge on the mire.
29 He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a jar of ointment.
30 Behind him he makes a path, shining with terror; the deep is like the surface of a boiling oil.
31 Nothing on earth is like him, a creature without fear.
32 He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all the sons of pride.




Chapter 42


1 Then Job answered the LORD and said:
I know that you can do everything,
and no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
2 “You said, ‘Who is this who darkens counsel
without knowledge?’
Therefore I declared what I did not understand,
things too wondrous for me, which I did not know.
3 You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak;
I will question you, and you will make me know.’
4 I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,
but now my eye has seen you.
5 Therefore I despise myself,
and I repent in dust and ashes.


7 And after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is burning against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken what is right about me, as my servant Job has.
8 So now take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and my servant Job will pray for you, for I will accept him so that I do not deal with you according to your folly, for you have not spoken what is right about me, as my servant Job has.”
9 So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job.


10 Then the LORD restored what Job had lost when he prayed for his friends, and the LORD increased all that Job had twofold.
11 And all his brothers, all his sisters, and all who had known him before came to him and ate a meal with him in his house, and they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a kesitah and a gold ring.
12 And the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning, and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
13 And he had seven sons and three daughters.
14 And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch.
15 And no women were found in all the land as beautiful as the daughters of Job, and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.
16 And Job lived after this one hundred forty years, and he saw his sons and his grandsons, four generations.
17 And Job died, old and full of days.﻿Psalms


Chapter 1


1 Blessed is the man
who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
nor stand in the way of sinners,
nor sit in the seat of scoffers.
2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
and on His law he meditates day and night.
3 He is like a tree planted by streams of water,
which produces fruit in due season,
its leaf does not wither;
and he prospers in all that he does.


4 The wicked are not so,
rather, they are like chaff driven away by the wind.
5 Therefore the wicked will not stand on the day of judgment,
nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
6 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
but the path of the wicked will fail.




Chapter 2


1 Why do the nations conspire
and the peoples plot in vain?  
2 The kings of the earth take their stand,
and the rulers gather together
against the Lord and against His Messiah, saying,  
3 "Let us tear off their shackles
and throw off their cords from us."  
4 The one sitting in heaven laughs;
the Lord mocks them.  
5 Then He speaks to them in His anger
and terrifies them in His wrath:  
6 "I have installed My king
on Zion, My holy mountain."  


7 I will proclaim this decree, the Lord said to me,
"You are My son; today I have begotten you.  
8 Ask of Me, and I will give the nations as your inheritance
and the ends of the earth as your possession.  
9 You will break them with a rod of iron;
you will shatter them like pottery."  


10 Now therefore, O kings, be wise;
be warned, O rulers of the earth.  
11 Serve the Lord with fear
and rejoice with trembling.  
12 Kiss the son,
lest in His anger, you perish in the way,
for his wrath is quickly kindled.
Blessed are all who take refuge in him.




Chapter 3


1 Lord, how many are my foes!
Many rise up against me;  
2 many say about me,
“There is no salvation for him in God.” Selah  


3 But You, O Lord, are a shield around me,
my glory, and the One who lifts my head.  
4 I cry aloud to the Lord,
and He answers me from His holy mountain. Selah  


5 I lay down and slept;
I awoke, for the Lord sustains me.  
6 I will not fear the multitudes of people
who have set themselves against me all around.  
7 Arise, O Lord! Save me, O my God!
For You strike all my enemies on the jaw;
You break the teeth of the wicked.  
8 Salvation belongs to the Lord;
may Your blessing be upon Your people. Selah




Chapter 4


1 Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress; be gracious to me and hear my prayer.  
2 O sons of men, how long will you turn my glory into shame? How long will you love vanity and seek after lies?  
3 But know that the Lord has set apart the godly man for Himself; the Lord hears when I call to Him.  
4 Tremble, and do not sin; meditate in your heart upon your bed and be still.  


5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness and trust in the Lord.  
6 Many say, “Who will show us any good?” Lift up the light of Your face upon us, O Lord!  
7 You have put joy in my heart, more than when their grain and new wine abound.  
8 In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for You alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.




Chapter 5


1 Give ear to my words, O Lord;  
    consider my groaning.  


2 Listen to the sound of my cry,  
    my King and my God,  
    for to You I pray.  


3 In the morning, O Lord, You hear my voice;  
    in the morning I lay my request before You and watch expectantly.  


4 For You are not a God who delights in wickedness;  
    evil does not dwell with You.  


5 The boastful will not stand before Your eyes;  
    You hate all who do iniquity.  


6 You destroy those who speak lies;  
    the Lord abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.  


7 But as for me, by Your great mercy I will enter Your house;  
    in fear of You, I will bow down toward Your holy temple.  


8 Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies;  
    make Your way straight before me.  


9 For there is no truth in their mouth;  
    their heart is destruction itself;  
    their throat is an open grave;  
    with their tongue they speak deceit.  


10 Make them bear their guilt, O God;  
    let them fall by their own schemes.  
    Cast them out for their many transgressions,  
    for they have rebelled against You.  


11 But let all who take refuge in You rejoice;  
    let them sing for joy forever.  
    Spread Your protection over them,  
    that those who love Your name may exult in You.  


12 For You bless the righteous, O Lord;  
    You surround him with favor as with a shield.  




Chapter 6


1 O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger,
    nor discipline me in Your wrath.  


2 Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am weak;
    heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled.  


3 My soul also is greatly troubled;
   but You, O Lord—how long?  


4 Turn, O Lord, deliver my soul;
    save me because of Your steadfast love.  


5 For in death there is no remembrance of You;
    in the grave, who will give You praise?  


6 I am weary with my groaning;
    every night I flood my bed with tears;
    I drench my couch with my weeping.  


7 My eye wastes away because of grief;
    it grows weak because of all my foes.  


8 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,
    for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.  


9 The Lord has heard my plea;
    the Lord accepts my prayer.  


10 All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled;
   they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.




Chapter 7


1 O LORD my God, in You I take refuge;  
save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me,  
2 lest he tear my soul like a lion,  
rending it in pieces with no one to rescue.


3 O LORD my God, if I have done this,  
if there is injustice in my hands,  
4 if I have repaid evil to him who was at peace with me  
or plundered my enemy without cause—  
5 let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it,  
let him trample my life to the ground  
and lay my glory in the dust. Selah


6 Arise, O LORD, in Your anger;  
lift Yourself up against the fury of my adversaries;  
awake for me—You have commanded judgment.  
7 Let the assembly of the peoples gather around You,  
and over it return on high.


8 The LORD judges the peoples;  
judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness  
and according to my integrity within me.  
9 Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous—  
for the righteous God tests the hearts and minds.


10 My shield is with God,  
who saves the upright in heart.  
11 God is a righteous judge,  
and a God who has indignation every day.


12 If a man does not repent, He sharpens His sword;  
He has bent His bow and made it ready.  
13 He has prepared His deadly weapons;  
He makes His arrows fiery shafts.


14 Behold, he is pregnant with wickedness:
he conceives trouble and gives birth to falsehood.  
15 He dug a pit and hollowed it out,  
and has fallen into the hole he made.  
16 His trouble returns upon his own head,  
and his violence comes down upon his own skull.


17 I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness,  
and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.  




Chapter 8


1  O LORD, our Lord,  
how majestic is Your name in all the earth,  
You who have set Your splendor above the heavens!


2  Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies  
You have established strength  
because of Your adversaries,  
to silence the enemy and the avenger.


3  When I look at Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,  
the moon and the stars, which You have set in place—


4  what is man that You take thought of him,  
and the son of man that You care for him?


5  Yet You have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings,  
and crowned him with glory and honor.


6  You have given him dominion over the works of Your hands;  
You have put all things under his feet:


7  all sheep and oxen,  
and also the beasts of the field,


8  the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,  
whatever passes through the paths of the seas.


9  O LORD, our Lord,  
how majestic is Your name in all the earth!




Chapter 9


1 I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; I will recount all Your wondrous deeds.  
2 I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.  


3 When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish before You.  
4 For You have upheld my right and my cause; You sat on the throne judging justly.  
5 You rebuked the nations; You destroyed the wicked; You blotted out their name forever and ever.  
6 The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins; their cities You uprooted— even the memory of them has perished.  


7 But the LORD sits enthroned forever; He has established His throne for judgment.  
8 He will judge the world with righteousness; He will execute judgment on the peoples with equity.  


9 The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.  
10 Those who know Your name trust in You, for You have not forsaken those who seek You, O LORD.  


11 Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion! Proclaim His deeds among the nations.  
12 For He who avenges blood remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.  


13 Be gracious to me, O LORD! See my affliction from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death,  
14 that I may recount all Your praises, in the gates of the daughter of Zion, that I may rejoice in Your salvation.  


15 The nations have sunk into the pit they made; their foot is caught in the net they hid.  
16 The LORD is known by the judgment He carries out; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.  


17 The wicked will return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.  
18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor shall never perish.  


19 Arise, O LORD! Let not man prevail; let the nations be judged before You!  
20 Put them in fear, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah.


Chapter 10


1 Why, O LORD, do You stand far off? Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble?
2 In his pride the wicked hunts down the afflicted; let them be caught in the schemes they have devised.


3 For the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul; the greedy man curses and despises the LORD.
4 In the arrogance of his face the wicked does not seek Him; all his thoughts are, “There is no God.”


5 His ways always prosper; Your judgments are far above, out of his sight; as for all his foes, he snorts at them.
6 He says in his heart, “I shall not be moved; through all generations I shall not meet adversity.”


7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.
8 He sits in ambush near the villages; in hidden places he murders the innocent. His eyes watch closely for the helpless.


9 He lies in wait in secret like a lion in his thicket; he lies in ambush to seize the afflicted; he seizes the afflicted when he draws them into his net.
10 He crouches, he bows down, and the helpless fall by his might.


11 He says in his heart, “God has forgotten, He hides His face, He will never see.”
12 Arise, O LORD! O God, lift up Your hand; do not forget the afflicted.


13 Why does the wicked despise God and say in his heart, “You will not call to account”?
14 But You do see, for You behold trouble and vexation to take it into Your hand. To You the helpless commits himself; You are the helper of the fatherless.


15 Break the arm of the wicked and the evildoer; call his wickedness to account until You find none.
16 The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations perish from His land.


17 O LORD, You hear the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their heart; You will incline Your ear
18 to give justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.




Chapter 11


1 In the Lord I have taken refuge; how can you say to my soul,  
“Flee to your mountain like a bird”?
2 For behold, the wicked bend the bow;  
they have set their arrow on the string  
to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart.
3 If the foundations are torn down,  
what can the righteous do?
4 The Lord is in His holy temple;  
the Lord—His throne is in heaven.  
His eyes behold,  
His eyelids test the sons of man.
5 The Lord tests the righteous,  
in His inmost being he hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.
6 He will rain down snares on the wicked:  
fire and brimstone and a scorching wind  
will be the portion of their cup.
7 For the Lord is righteous; He loves righteous deeds;  
the upright shall behold His face.


Chapter 12


1 Save, O LORD, for the godly man has come to an end;  
    the faithful have vanished from among the sons of man.  
2 Everyone speaks falsehood with his neighbor;  
    with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.


3 May the LORD cut off all flattering lips,  
    the tongue that boasts great things—  
4 those who have said, “By our tongue we will prevail;  
    our lips are with us—who is master over us?”


5 “Because of the oppression of the poor,  
    because of the groaning of the needy,  
    now I will arise,” says the LORD;  
    “I will set him in safety, the one who longs for it.”


6 The words of the LORD are pure words,  
    like silver refined in a crucible on the ground,  
    purified seven times.


7 You, O LORD, will keep them;  
    You will guard him from this generation forever.  
8 The wicked strut about on every side,  
    when vileness is exalted among the sons of man.


Chapter 13


1 How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever?  
How long will You hide Your face from me?  
2 How long must I take counsel in my soul,  
and have sorrow in my heart all day long?  
How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?  


3 Look upon me and answer, O LORD my God.  
Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death,  
4 lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed over him,”  
and my foes rejoice because I am shaken.  


5 But I have trusted in Your steadfast love;  
my heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.  
6 I will sing to the LORD,  
for He has dealt bountifully with me.


Chapter 14


1 The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”
They are corrupt; they do vile deeds.
There is no one who does good.
2 The Lord looks down from heaven upon the sons of man
To see if there is anyone who understands, anyone who seeks after God.


3 All have turned aside; together they have become corrupt.
There is no one who does good—no, not even one.
4 Do all the workers of iniquity not know, who eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon the Lord?


5 There they are in great dread, for God is with the righteous generation.
6 You would put to shame the counsel of the poor, but the Lord is his refuge.
7 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!
When the Lord restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob shall rejoice;
Israel shall be glad.




Chapter 15


1 O Lord, who may dwell in your tent?  
Who may live on your holy mountain?
2 He who walks blamelessly and does what is right,  
who speaks the truth from his heart,
3 who does not slander with his tongue,  
does no harm to his neighbor,  
and does not cast reproach on his friend;
4 in whose eyes a vile man is despised,  
but who honors those who fear the Lord;  
who swears to his own hurt and does not change;
5 who does not lend his money at interest  
and does not accept a bribe against the innocent.  
He who does these things shall never be shaken.




Chapter 16


1 Preserve me, O God, for I take refuge in You.  
2 I said to the LORD, “You are my Lord;
    I have no good apart from You.”  
3 As for the holy ones who are in the land,
    they are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.  
4 The sorrows of those who chase after another god will multiply;
    I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood,
    nor will I take their names upon my lips.  


5 The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup;
   You hold my lot.  
6 The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;
     indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.  


7 I will bless the LORD who gives me counsel;
    in the night also my conscience instructs me.  
8 I have set the LORD always before me;
    because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.  


9 Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices;
    my flesh also dwells secure.  
10 For You will not abandon my soul to the grave,
    nor will You let Your holy one see decay.  
11 You make known to me the path of life;
    in Your presence is fullness of joy;
    at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.




Chapter 17


1 Hear, O LORD, my just cause; attend to my cry;
    give ear to my prayer from lips without deceit.  
2 Let my vindication come from your presence;
    let your eyes behold what is right.  


3 You have tested my heart, you have visited me by night,
    you have tried me and found nothing;
    I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.  
4 As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips
    I have avoided the paths of the violent.  
5 My steps have held fast to your paths;
    my feet have not slipped.  


6 I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God;
    incline your ear to me; hear my words.  
7 Show the wonder of your steadfast love, O Savior
    to those who seek refuge from their adversaries at your right hand.  
8 Keep me as the apple of the eye;
    hide me in the shadow of your wings,  
9 from the wicked who do me violence,
    my deadly enemies who surround me.  


10 They close their hearts to pity;
    with their mouths they speak arrogantly.  
11 They have now surrounded our steps;
    they set their eyes to cast us down to the ground.  
12 He is like a lion eager to tear,
    like a young lion lurking in hiding places.  


13 Arise, O LORD, confront him, bring him low;
    deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,  
14 from men, by your hand, O LORD, from men of the world whose portion is in this life.
    You fill their belly with your treasure;
    they are satisfied with children and leave their abundance to their infants.  


15 As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;
    when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.




Chapter 18


1 I love you, O LORD, my strength.  
2 The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,
    my God, my rock in whom I take refuge, my shield,
    and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.  
3 I call upon the LORD, who is worthy of praise,
    and I am saved from my enemies.  


4 The cords of death encompassed me;
    the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.  
5 The cords of the grave entangled me;
    the snares of death confronted me.  
6 In my distress I called upon the LORD,
    and to my God I cried for help.
    From His temple He heard my voice,
    and my cry before Him came into His ears.  


7 Then the earth shook and quaked;
    the foundations of the mountains trembled
    and were shaken, because He was angry.  
8 Smoke went up from His nostrils, and devouring fire from His mouth;
    glowing coals blazed forth from Him.  
9 He bowed the heavens and came down;
    thick darkness was under His feet.  
10 He rode on a cherub and flew;
    He came swiftly on the wings of the wind.  
11 He made darkness His covering, His canopy
    around Him, thick clouds, dark with water.  
12 From the brightness before Him, hailstones and coals of fire passed through His clouds.  
13 The LORD thundered from the heavens,
    and the Most High uttered His voice, hailstones and coals of fire.  
14 He sent out His arrows and scattered them;
    He flashed forth lightning and routed them.  
15 Then the channels of the sea were exposed,
    and the foundations of the world were laid bare
    at Your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.  


16 He reached down from on high and took hold of me;
    He drew me out of many waters.  
17 He rescued me from my powerful enemy,
    and from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.  
18 They confronted me in the day of my calamity,
    but the LORD was my support.  
19 He brought me out into a spacious place;
    He rescued me because He delighted in me.  


20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness;
    according to the cleanness of my hands He repaid me.  
21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
    and have not wickedly departed from my God.  
22 For all His judgments were before me,
    and I did not put away His statutes from me.  
23 I was blameless before Him, and I kept myself from guilt.  
24 So the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness,
    according to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.  


25 With the merciful You show Yourself merciful;
    with the blameless man You show Yourself blameless;  
26 with the pure You show Yourself pure,
    and with the crooked You make Yourself seem shrewd.  
27 For You save a humble people,
    but the haughty eyes You bring down.  
28 For it is You who light my lamp;
    the LORD my God illumines my darkness.  


29 For by You I can run against a troop,
    and by my God I can leap over a wall.  
30 This God—His way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true;
    He is a shield for all who take refuge in Him.  
31 For who is God but the LORD?
    And who is a rock except our God?  


32 The God who girds me with strength and makes my way blameless,  
33 He makes my feet like the feet of a deer and sets me secure on the heights.  
34 He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.  
35 You have given me the shield of Your salvation,
    and Your right hand upheld me, and Your gentleness made me great.  
36 You gave a wide place beneath my steps, and my feet did not slip.  


37 I pursued my enemies and overtook them;
    I did not turn back until they were consumed.  
38 I struck them down so that they were not able to rise;
    they fell under my feet.  
39 For You girded me with strength for the battle;
    You made those who rose against me sink under me.  
40 You made my enemies turn their backs to me,
    and those who hated me I destroyed.  
41 They cried for help, but there was none to save;
    they cried to the LORD, but He did not answer them.  
42 I beat them fine as dust before the wind;
    I cast them out like the mire of the streets.  


43 You delivered me from the strife of the people;
    You made me the head of the nations;
    a people I had not known served me.  
44 As soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me;
    foreigners came cringing to me.  
45 Foreigners lost heart and came trembling from their strongholds.  


46 The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock,
    and exalted be the God of my salvation—  
47 the God who gave me vengeance and subdued nations under me,  
48 who delivered me from my enemies;
    indeed, You exalted me above those who rose against me;
    You rescued me from the man of violence.  


49 Therefore I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the nations,
    and sing praises to Your name.  
50 He gives great salvation to His king, and shows steadfast love to His anointed,
    to David and his offspring forever.




Chapter 19


1 The heavens declare the glory of God,  
 and the sky above proclaims the work of his hands.  
2 Day to day pours forth speech,  
 and night to night reveals knowledge.  
3 There is no speech, nor are there words;  
 their voice is not heard.  
4 Yet their line goes out through all the earth,  
 and their words to the end of the world.  
In them he has set a tent for the sun,  
5 which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber,  
 and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.  
6 Its rising is from the end of the heavens,  
 and its circuit to the end of them,  
 and there is nothing hidden from its heat.


7 The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul;  
 the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making the simple wise.  
8 The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart;  
 the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.  
9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever;  
 the judgments of the LORD are true and altogether righteous.  
10 More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold;  
 sweeter also than honey and drippings from the honeycomb.  
11 Moreover, by them your servant is warned;  
 in keeping them there is great reward.


12 Who can discern his errors?  
 Cleanse me from hidden faults.  
13 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins;  
 let them not have dominion over me.  
Then I shall be blameless,  
 and innocent of great transgression.


14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart  
 be acceptable in your sight,  
 O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.




Chapter 20


1 May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble;
    may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
2 May He send you help from the sanctuary and support you from Zion.
3 May He remember all your offerings and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices. Selah.


4 May He grant you your heart’s desire and fulfill all your plans.
5 We will shout for joy over your salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners.
May the LORD fulfill all your petitions.
6 Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed;
He will answer him from His holy heaven with the saving might of His right hand.


7 Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.
8 They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand upright.
9 O LORD, save the king! May He answer us when we call.




Chapter 21


1 O LORD, the king rejoices in Your strength, and how greatly he exults in Your salvation!  
2 You have granted him the desire of his heart and have not withheld the request of his lips.  
3 For You come to meet him with blessings of good things; You set a crown of pure gold upon his head.  


4 He asked You for life, and You gave it to him—length of days, forever and ever.  
5 His glory is great through Your salvation; You bestow majesty and splendor upon him.  
6 For You make him most blessed forever; You make him glad with the joy of Your presence.  


7 For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be shaken.  


8 Your hand will find out all Your enemies; Your right hand will seize those who hate You.  
9 You will make them like a fiery furnace at the time of Your appearing. The LORD will swallow them up in His wrath, and fire will consume them.  
10 You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their descendants from among the sons of man.  
11 Though they plan evil against You, though they devise schemes, they will not succeed.  
12 For You will put them to flight; You will aim Your bow at their faces.  


13 Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength! We will sing and praise Your power.




Chapter 22


1 My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?  
Why are You so far from saving me,  
from the words of my groaning?
2 My God, I call out by day, but You do not answer;  
and by night—but I find no rest.


3 Yet You are holy,  
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.
4 In You our fathers trusted;  
they trusted, and You delivered them.


5 To You they cried and were rescued;  
in You they trusted and were not put to shame.
6 But I am a worm and not a man,  
scorned by men and despised by the people.


7 All who see me mock me;  
they open wide their mouths; they wag their heads:
8 “He trusts in the LORD; let Him deliver him;  
let Him rescue him, for He delights in him.”


9 Yet You are the one who brought me out of the womb;  
You made me trust You from my mother's breasts.
10 On You I was cast from birth,  
and from my mother’s womb You have been my God.


11 Do not be far from me,  
for trouble is near,  
and there is no one to help.
12 Many bulls surround me;  
strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.


13 They open wide their mouths at me,  
like a ravenous and roaring lion.
14 I am poured out like water,  
and all my bones are disjointed;  
my heart is like wax—  
it melts within me.


15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd,  
and my tongue clings to my jaws;  
You lay me in the dust of death.
16 For dogs have surrounded me;  
a gang of evildoers has encircled me;  
they have pierced my hands and feet.


17 I can count all my bones—  
they look, they stare at me.
18 They divide my garments among themselves,  
and for my clothing they cast lots.


19 But You, O LORD, do not be far off!  
O my strength, come quickly to help me!
20 Deliver my soul from the sword,  
my precious life from the power of the dog.


21 Save me from the lion’s mouth,  
and from the horns of wild oxen—You have answered me.
22 I will declare Your name to my brothers;  
in the midst of the congregation I will praise You.


23 You who fear the LORD, praise Him!  
All you descendants of Jacob, glorify Him;  
and stand in awe of Him, all you descendants of Israel!
24 For He has not despised nor abhorred  
the affliction of the afflicted,  
and He has not hidden His face from him,  
but when he cried to Him, He heard.


25 From You comes my praise in the great congregation;  
my vows I will fulfill before those who fear Him.
26 The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied;  
those who seek Him shall praise the LORD.  
May your heart live forever!


27 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD,  
and all the families of the nations shall bow down before You.
28 For the kingdom is the LORD’s,  
and He rules over the nations.


29 All the prosperous of the earth shall eat and bow down;  
all who go down to the dust shall bow before Him—  
even he who could not keep his soul alive.
30 Posterity shall serve Him;  
it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation.
31 They shall come and proclaim His righteousness  
to a people yet to be born,  
that He has done it.




Chapter 23


1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall lack nothing.
2 He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside still waters.
3 He restores my soul; He guides me in paths of righteousness for His name’s sake.
4 Even though I walk through the valley of deep darkness, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
6 Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall pursue me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.




Chapter 24


1 The earth is the Lord’s, and all that fills it, the world and those who dwell in it.  
2 For He founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers.


3 Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? And who may stand in His holy place?  
4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood and has not sworn deceitfully.  
5 He shall receive blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of his salvation.  
6 This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face—O God of Jacob.


7 Lift up your heads, O gates, and be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!  
8 Who is this King of Glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.  
9 Lift up your heads, O gates, and lift them up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!  
10 Who is this King of Glory? The Lord of hosts—He is the King of Glory.




Chapter 25


1 To You, O LORD, I lift up my soul.  
2 My God, in You I trust; do not let me be put to shame; do not let my enemies exult over me.  
3 Indeed, none who wait for You will be put to shame; they shall be put to shame who act treacherously without cause.


4 Make me know Your ways, O LORD; teach me Your paths.  
5 Lead me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; for You I wait all the day.  
6 Remember Your mercies, O LORD, and Your steadfast love, for they are from of old.  
7 Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to Your steadfast love remember me, for the sake of Your goodness, O LORD.


8 Good and upright is the LORD; therefore He instructs sinners in the way.  
9 He leads the humble in justice and teaches the humble His way.  
10 All the paths of the LORD are steadfast love and faithfulness to those who keep His covenant and His testimonies.  
11 For the sake of Your name, O LORD, pardon my guilt, for it is great.


12 Who is the man who fears the LORD? This man will be instructed in the way he should choose.  
13 His soul shall abide in prosperity, and his descendants shall inherit the land.  
14 The secret of the LORD is with those who fear Him, and He makes them know His covenant.


15 My eyes are ever toward the LORD, for He will free my feet from the net.  
16 Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.  
17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my distresses.  
18 Look upon my affliction and my trouble, and forgive all my sins.  
19 Consider my enemies, for they are many, as are those who hate me with violent hatred.  
20 Guard my soul and deliver me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in You.  
21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for You.


22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.




Chapter 26


1 Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity; I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.
2 Examine me, O LORD, and try me; test my kidneys and my heart.
3 For Your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I have walked in Your truth.


4 I do not sit with deceitful men, nor do I go with hypocrites.
5 I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I do not sit with the wicked.


6 I wash my hands in innocence and go around Your altar, O LORD,
7 to proclaim thanksgiving aloud and to recount all Your wondrous deeds.


8 O LORD, I love the habitation of Your house and the place where Your glory dwells.


9 Do not sweep away my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood,
10 in whose hands are evil plots and whose right hand is full of bribes.


11 But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity; redeem me and be gracious to me.
12 My foot stands on level ground; in the great assembly I will bless the LORD.




Chapter 27


1 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?
The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
2 When evildoers draw near against me to devour my flesh,
my adversaries and my enemies, they stumbled and fell.
3 Though an army encamp against me, my heart will not fear;
though war arise against me, even then I will trust.


4 One thing I have asked from the LORD, that I will seek:
to dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life,
to behold the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in His temple.


5 For He will hide me in His shelter in the day of trouble;
He will conceal me in the hiding place of His tent;
He will lift me high upon a rock.


6 And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me,
and I will offer in His tent sacrifices with shouts of joy;
I will sing and make melody to the LORD.
7 Hear, O LORD, my voice when I cry out;
be gracious to me and answer me.


8 On Your behalf my heart has said, “Seek My face.”
Your face, O LORD, I will seek.
9 Do not hide Your face from me;
do not turn Your servant away in anger.
You have been my help; do not forsake me or abandon me,
O God of my salvation.
10 Though my father and my mother have forsaken me,
the LORD will take me in.


11 Teach me Your way, O LORD,
and lead me on a level path because of my foes.
12 Do not give me up to the will of my adversaries,
for false witnesses have risen against me,
and they breathe out violence.
13 I believe that I shall see the goodness of the LORD
in the land of the living.
14 Wait for the LORD; be strong,
and let your heart be courageous;
wait for the LORD.




Chapter 28


1 To You, O LORD, I call;
my rock, do not be deaf to me,
lest, if You be silent to me,
I become like those who go down to the pit.
2 Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to You,
when I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.


3 Do not drag me away with the wicked
and with the workers of iniquity,
who speak peace with their neighbors
while evil is in their hearts.
4 Give to them according to their work
and according to the evil of their deeds.
Give to them according to the work of their hands;
render their recompense to them.
5 Because they do not regard the deeds of the LORD
nor the work of His hands,
He will tear them down and not build them up.


6 Blessed be the LORD,
for He has heard the voice of my supplications.
7 The LORD is my strength and my shield;
in Him my heart trusts, and I am helped.
My heart exults,
and with my song I will give thanks to Him.
8 The LORD is the strength of His people;
He is a refuge of salvation for His anointed.
9 Save Your people and bless Your heritage;
shepherd them also and carry them forever.




Chapter 29


1 Ascribe to the LORD, O sons of the mighty,
ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
2 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name;
worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.


3 The voice of the LORD is over the waters;
the God of glory thunders,
the LORD is over many waters.
4 The voice of the LORD is powerful;
the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.


5 The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars;
the LORD shatters the cedars of Lebanon.
6 He makes Lebanon skip like a calf,
and Sirion like a young wild ox.


7 The voice of the LORD hews out flames of fire.
8 The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness;
the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
9 The voice of the LORD makes the deer give birth
and strips the forests bare,
and in His temple all cry, “Glory!”


10 The LORD sits enthroned over the flood;
the LORD sits enthroned as king forever.
11 The LORD gives strength to His people;
the LORD blesses His people with peace.




Chapter 30


1 I will exalt You, O LORD, for You have drawn me up
and have not let my enemies rejoice over me.
2 O LORD my God, I cried to You for help,
and You have healed me.
3 O LORD, You have brought me up alive from the grave;
You restored me to life from among those who go down to the pit.


4 Sing praise to the LORD, O you His faithful ones,
and give thanks to His holy name.
5 For His anger is but for a moment,
but His favor is for a lifetime.
Weeping may remain for the night,
but joy comes in the morning.


6 As for me, I said in my prosperity,
“I shall never be moved.”
7 O LORD, by Your favor You made my mountain stand strong;
You hid Your face—I was dismayed.


8 To You, O LORD, I called,
and to the Lord I made supplication:
9 “What gain is there in my death, in my going down to the pit?
Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your truth?
10 Hear, O LORD, and be gracious to me;
O LORD, be my helper.”


11 You turned my mourning into dancing;
You removed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,
12 so that my soul may sing praise to You and not be silent.
O LORD my God, I will give thanks to You forever.




Chapter 31


1 In You, O LORD, I have taken refuge;
let me never be put to shame;
in Your righteousness deliver me.
2 Incline Your ear to me;
rescue me speedily.
Be to me a rock of refuge,
a strong fortress to save me.


3 For You are my rock and my fortress;
and for Your name’s sake You will lead me and guide me.
4 You will pull me out of the net that they have hidden for me,
for You are my refuge.
5 Into Your hand I commit my spirit;
You have redeemed me, O LORD, God of truth.


6 I hate those who regard worthless idols,
but I trust in the LORD.
7 I will rejoice and be glad in Your lovingkindness,
because You have seen my affliction;
You have known the distress of my soul,
8 and You have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy;
You have set my feet in a broad place.


9 Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am in distress;
my eye is wasted from grief,
my soul and my body also.
10 For my life is spent with sorrow
and my years with sighing;
my strength fails because of my iniquity,
and my bones waste away.


11 I am a reproach among all my adversaries,
especially to my neighbors,
and a dread to my acquaintances;
those who see me in the street flee from me.
12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind;
I am like a broken vessel.
13 For I have heard the slander of many—
terror on every side!—
as they take counsel together against me;
they scheme to take my life.


14 But I trust in You, O LORD;
I say, “You are my God.”
15 My times are in Your hand;
deliver me from the hand of my enemies
and from those who pursue me.
16 Make Your face shine upon Your servant;
save me in Your lovingkindness.
17 O LORD, let me not be put to shame,
for I call upon You;
let the wicked be put to shame;
let them lie down in the grave.


18 Let the lying lips be mute,
which speak arrogantly against the righteous
with pride and contempt.


19 How great is Your goodness,
which You have stored up for those who fear You,
which You perform for those who take refuge in You
before the sons of men!
20 In the shelter of Your presence You hide them from the schemes of men;
You conceal them in Your pavilion
from the strife of tongues.


21 Blessed be the LORD,
for He has shown me His lovingkindness
in a fortified city.
22 As for me, I said in my alarm,
“I am cut off from before Your eyes.”
Nevertheless, You heard the voice of my supplications
when I cried to You.


23 Love the LORD, all you His saints!
The LORD preserves the faithful
but abundantly repays the one who acts with pride.
24 Be strong, and let your heart take courage,
all you who wait for the LORD.




Chapter 32


1 Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven,
whose sin is covered.
2 Blessed is the man to whom the LORD does not count iniquity,
and in whose spirit there is no deceit.


3 When I kept silent, my bones wasted away
through my groaning all day long.
4 For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me;
my strength was dried up as if by the heat of summer. Selah


5 I acknowledged my sin to You,
and I did not cover my iniquity;
I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,”
and You forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah


6 Therefore let everyone who is godly
offer prayer to You at a time when You may be found;
surely in the rush of great waters,
they shall not reach him.
7 You are a hiding place for me;
You preserve me from trouble;
You surround me with shouts of deliverance. Selah


8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;
I will counsel you with My eye upon you.
9 Do not be like a horse or a mule, without understanding,
which must be curbed with bit and bridle,
or it will not stay near you.


10 Many are the sorrows of the wicked,
but steadfast love surrounds the one who trusts in the LORD.
11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, O righteous,
and shout for joy, all you upright in heart!




Chapter 33


1 Rejoice in the LORD, O righteous!
Praise befits the upright.
2 Give thanks to the LORD with the lyre;
make melody to Him with the harp of ten strings.
3 Sing to Him a new song;
play skillfully with a shout of joy.


4 For the word of the LORD is upright,
and all His work is done in faithfulness.
5 He loves righteousness and justice;
the earth is full of the lovingkindness of the LORD.


6 By the word of the LORD the heavens were made,
and by the breath of His mouth all their host.
7 He gathers the waters of the sea as a heap;
He puts the deeps in storehouses.
8 Let all the earth fear the LORD;
let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
9 For He spoke, and it came to be;
He commanded, and it stood firm.


10 The LORD brings the counsel of the nations to nothing;
He frustrates the plans of the peoples.
11 The counsel of the LORD stands forever,
the plans of His heart to all generations.
12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD,
the people He has chosen as His inheritance.


13 The LORD looks down from heaven;
He sees all the sons of man;
14 from where He dwells He looks
on all the inhabitants of the earth—
15 He who fashions the hearts of them all,
who considers all their deeds.


16 The king is not saved by the size of his army;
a warrior is not delivered by great strength.
17 The horse is a false hope for salvation,
nor does it deliver by its great might.


18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear Him,
on those who hope in His lovingkindness,
19 to deliver their soul from death
and to keep them alive in famine.


20 Our soul waits for the LORD;
He is our help and our shield.
21 For our heart is glad in Him,
because we trust in His holy name.
22 Let Your lovingkindness, O LORD, be upon us,
as we hope in You.




Chapter 34


1 I will bless the LORD at all times;
His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
2 My soul makes its boast in the LORD;
the humble shall hear and be glad.
3 Magnify the LORD with me,
and let us exalt His name together.


4 I sought the LORD, and He answered me
and delivered me from all my fears.
5 They looked to Him and were radiant,
and their faces shall never be ashamed.
6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him
and saved him out of all his troubles.
7 The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him
and delivers them.


8 Taste and see that the LORD is good!
Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!
9 Fear the LORD, you His saints,
for those who fear Him have no lack.
10 The young lions suffer want and hunger,
but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.


11 Come, O sons, listen to me;
I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
12 Who is the man who desires life
and loves many days, that he may see good?
13 Keep your tongue from evil
and your lips from speaking deceit.
14 Turn away from evil and do good;
seek peace and pursue it.


15 The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous
and His ears toward their cry.
16 The face of the LORD is against those who do evil,
to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
17 When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears
and delivers them out of all their troubles.
18 The LORD is near to the brokenhearted
and saves the crushed in spirit.


19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
but the LORD delivers him out of them all.
20 He keeps all his bones;
not one of them is broken.
21 Evil will slay the wicked,
and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
22 The LORD redeems the soul of His servants;
none of those who take refuge in Him will be condemned.




Chapter 35


1 Contend, O Lord, with those who contend against me;
fight against those who fight me.  
2 Take up shield and armor; rise up and come to my aid.  
3 Draw out the spear and javelin against my pursuers;
say to my soul, “I am your salvation.”  


4 Let those who seek my life be put to shame and dishonored;
let those who plot evil against me be turned back and humiliated.  
5 Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them away.  
6 Let their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.  
7 For without cause they hid their net for me;
without reason they dug a pit for my soul.  
8 Let destruction come upon them unexpectedly;
let the net they hid ensnare them; let them fall into their own pit to their ruin.  


9 Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord;
it will delight in His salvation.  
10 All my bones will say, “O Lord, who is like You,
who rescues the poor from those too strong for them,
the poor and needy from those who rob them?”  


11 Malicious witnesses rise up;
they accuse me of things I know nothing about.  
12 They repay me evil for good, leaving my soul bereft.  
13 Yet when they were sick, I put on sackcloth;
I humbled myself with fasting, and my prayer returned to my own heart.  
14 I went about as though grieving for a friend or brother;
I bowed down in mourning, as one lamenting a mother.  
15 But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together;
they gathered against me, attackers I did not know, tearing at me without ceasing.  
16 Like godless mockers at a feast, they gnashed their teeth at me.  


17 O Lord, how long will You look on?
Rescue my soul from their ravages, my precious life from the lions.  
18 I will give You thanks in the great assembly;
among a mighty throng I will praise You.  


19 Do not let those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me;
do not let those who hate me without cause wink their eyes.  
20 For they do not speak peace, but devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.  
21 They open their mouths wide against me;
they say, “Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen it!”  


22 You have seen this, O Lord; do not remain silent.
O Lord, do not be far from me.  
23 Awake and rise to my defense, to my cause, my God and my Lord.  
24 Vindicate me, O Lord my God, according to Your righteousness,
and do not let them rejoice over me.  
25 Do not let them say in their hearts, “Aha, just what we wanted!”
Do not let them say, “We have swallowed him up.”  
26 Let all who rejoice at my calamity be ashamed and confounded together;
let those who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and dishonor.  


27 Let those who delight in my righteousness shout for joy and be glad;
let them say continually, “The Lord be exalted, who delights in the prosperity of His servant.”  
28 And my tongue will proclaim Your righteousness and Your praise all day long.




Chapter 36


1 A declaration of rebellion resides in the heart of the wicked; there is no dread of God before their eyes.
2 For they flatter themselves in their own sight, thinking their guilt will not be uncovered or despised.
3 The words of their mouth are wicked and deceitful; they have stopped acting wisely or doing good.
4 They plot wickedness on their beds; they commit themselves to a crooked path; they do not reject evil.


5 Your steadfast love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness extends to the clouds.
6 Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your judgments are like the vast deep; you preserve both man and beast, O Lord.
7 How precious is your steadfast love, O God! The sons of man take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
8 They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.
9 For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.


10 Continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright in heart.
11 Do not let the foot of the arrogant trample me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
12 There the evildoers have fallen; they are thrust down and cannot rise.




Chapter 37


1 Do not be provoked by evildoers; do not be envious of those who do wrong.  
2 For like grass they will soon wither, and like green plants they will fade away.  
3 Trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.  
4 Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart.  
5 Commit your way to the Lord; trust in Him, and He will act.  
6 He will bring forth your righteousness like the light, and your justice like the noonday sun.  


7 Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for Him; do not be provoked by the man who prospers in his way, by the man who carries out wicked schemes.  
8 Cease from anger and forsake wrath; do not be provoked—it leads only to evil.  
9 For evildoers will be cut off, but those who wait for the Lord will inherit the land.  
10 Yet a little while, and the wicked man will be no more; though you look for his place, he will not be there.  
11 But the humble will inherit the land and will delight in abundant peace.  


12 The wicked man plots against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him.  
13 The Lord laughs at him, for He sees that his day is coming.  
14 The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose way is upright.  
15 Their sword will enter their own heart, and their bows will be broken.  


16 Better is the little that the righteous man has than the abundance of many wicked men.  
17 For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.  
18 The Lord knows the days of the blameless, and their inheritance will last forever.  
19 They will not be ashamed        In evil times, and in days of famine they will be satisfied.  
20 But the wicked will perish; the enemies of the Lord, like the glory of the pastures, will vanish—they will vanish like smoke.  


21 The wicked man borrows and does not repay, but the righteous man is gracious and gives.  
22 For those blessed by Him will inherit the land, but those cursed by Him will be cut off.  
23 The steps of a man are established by the Lord, and He delights in his way.  
24 Though he falls, he will not be cast down, for the Lord upholds his hand.  


25 I have been young, and now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread.  
26 All day long he is gracious and lends, and his offspring are a blessing.  
27 Turn away from evil and do good, and dwell forever.  
28 For the Lord loves justice and will not forsake His godly ones; they are preserved forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off.  
29 The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.  


30 The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.  
31 The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip.  
32 The wicked man watches the righteous and seeks to kill him.  
33 The Lord will not abandon him to his hand or let him be condemned when he is judged.  


34 Wait for the Lord and keep His way, and He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.  
35 I have seen a wicked, ruthless man flourishing like a luxuriant native tree.  
36 But he passed away, and behold, he was no more; though I sought him, he could not be found.  


37 Observe the blameless man and consider the upright, for the man of peace has a future.  
38 But transgressors will be destroyed together; the future of the wicked will be cut off.  
39 The salvation of the righteous is from the Lord; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.  
40 The Lord helps them and delivers them; He delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in Him.




Chapter 38


1 O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath.  
2 For your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down upon me.  
3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.  
4 For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.  
5 My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness.  
6 I am bent over and greatly bowed down; I go about mourning all day long.  
7 For my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.  
8 I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan because of the turmoil of my heart.  


9 Lord, all my longing is before you, and my sighing is not hidden from you.  
10 My heart throbs, my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes—it also has gone from me.  
11 My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my kinsmen stand far off.  
12 Those who seek my life lay snares for me; those who seek my hurt speak of ruin and meditate treachery all day long.  


13 But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear, like a mute man who does not open his mouth.  
14 I have become like a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth are no rebukes.  
15 For I hope in you, O Lord; you will answer, O Lord my God.  
16 For I said, “Lest they rejoice over me; when my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.”  
17 For I am ready to fall, and my pain is always before me.  
18 I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin.  


19 But my enemies are vigorous; they are strong, and those who hate me wrongfully are multiplied.  
20 Those who render me evil for good accuse me because I follow after good.  
21 Do not forsake me, O Lord; O my God, be not far from me.  
22 Hasten to help me, O Lord, my salvation.




Chapter 39


1 I said, "I will guard my ways,  
    that I may not sin with my tongue;  
    I will put a muzzle on my mouth  
    while the wicked are in my presence."  


2 I was silent and held my peace,  
    even from good,  
    but my distress grew worse.  


3 My heart grew hot within me;  
    as I meditated, the fire burned.  
    Then I spoke with my tongue:  


4 "O Lord, make me know my end  
    and the measure of my days, what it is;  
    let me know how fleeting I am.  


5 Behold, You have made my days a few handbreadths,  
    and my lifetime is as nothing before You.  
    Surely every man stands as a mere breath.  


6 Surely man goes about as a shadow!  
    Surely they busy themselves in vain;  
    he heaps up wealth, not knowing who will gather it.  


7 And now, O Lord, for what do I wait?  
    My hope is in You.  


8 Deliver me from all my transgressions;  
    do not make me the scorn of the fool.  


9 I am silent; I do not open my mouth,  
    for You have done it.  


10 Remove Your stroke from me;  
    I am worn down by the blow of Your hand.  


11 When You discipline a man with rebukes for sin,  
    You consume like a moth what is dear to him;  
    surely every man is but a breath.  


12 Hear my prayer, O Lord,  
    and give ear to my cry;  
    do not be silent at my tears.  
    For I am a sojourner with You,  
    a foreigner, as all my fathers were.  


13 Look away from me, that I may regain strength  
    before I depart and am no more.”




Psalm 40


1 I waited patiently for the Lord, and He turned to me and heard my cry.
2 He lifted me out of the pit of destruction, out of the muddy clay,
    and set my feet on a rock, making my steps secure.
3 He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.
    Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.


4 Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust,
    who does not turn to the proud or to those who follow lies.
5 Lord my God, You have done many wondrous things—
    Your plans for us are beyond compare.
    If I were to speak and declare them all, they would be too numerous to count.


6 You take no delight in sacrifice and offering; You have opened my ears.
    Burnt offerings and sin offerings You have not required.


7 Then I said, “Here I am; in the scroll of the book it is written about me.
8 I delight to do Your will, my God; Your law is within my heart.”


9 I have proclaimed righteousness in the great assembly;
    indeed, I do not restrain my lips—You, Lord, know this.
10 I have not hidden Your righteousness in my heart;
    Rather, I have spoken openly of Your faithfulness and salvation.
    I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and truth from the great assembly.


11 Lord, do not withhold Your mercy from me;
    may Your lovingkindness and truth always guard me.
12 For troubles without number have surrounded me;
    my iniquities have overtaken me—I cannot see.
    They are more than the hairs of my head, and my courage has abandoned me.


13 Lord, be pleased to rescue me; hurry to help me, O Lord.
14 Let those who seek to destroy my life be ashamed and humiliated together;
    let those who take delight in my harm be turned back in disgrace.
15 Let those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” be appalled because of their shame.


16 But may all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;
    may those who love Your salvation always say, “The Lord is great!”
17 As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord thinks of me.
    You are my help and my deliverer—my God, do not delay.




Chapter 41


1 Blessed is the man who considers the poor;
  the LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble.
2 The LORD will protect him and keep him alive;
  he will be called blessed in the land.
  You will not hand him over to the desire of his enemies.  


3 The LORD will sustain him on his sickbed;
  in his illness, You restore him to full health.  
4 As for me, I said, “O LORD, be gracious to me;
  heal my soul, for I have sinned against You.”  


5 My enemies speak evil of me: “When will he die and his name perish?”  
6 And if one comes to see me, he speaks lies;
  his heart gathers iniquity for itself. When he goes out, he tells it abroad.  
7 All who hate me whisper together against me;
  they imagine the worst for me.  


8 They say, “A wicked thing is poured out upon him;
  now that he lies down, he will not rise again.”  
9 Even my close friend, in whom I trusted,
  who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.  
10 But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up, that I may repay them.  


11 By this I know that You delight in me:
  my enemy does not triumph over me.  
12 As for me, You uphold me in my integrity
  and set me in Your presence forever.  
13 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
  from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.




Chapter 42


1 As the deer pants for streams of water,
so my soul pants for You, O God.
2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
When shall I come and appear before God?


3 My tears have been my food day and night,
while they continually say to me, “Where is your God?”
4 These things I remember as I pour out my soul within me:
how I would go with the multitude,
leading them in procession to the house of God,
with a voice of joy and thanksgiving, a crowd keeping festival.


5 Why are you cast down, O my soul?
And why are you in turmoil within me?
Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him,
the salvation of my countenance and my God.


6 My soul is cast down within me;
therefore I remember You from the land of the Jordan
and the heights of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
7 Deep calls to deep at the roar of Your waterfalls;
all Your breakers and Your waves have gone over me.


8 By day the Lord commands His lovingkindness,
and at night His song is with me— a prayer to the God of my life.
9 I say to God, my rock, “Why have You forgotten me?
Why must I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”
10 As with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me,
while they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”


11 Why are you cast down, O my soul?
And why are you in turmoil within me?
Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him,
the salvation of my countenance and my God.




Chapter 43


1 Vindicate me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation;
    deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.  
2 For You are the God of my refuge—why have You rejected me?
    Why do I go about in mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?


3 Send out Your light and Your truth—let them guide me;
    let them bring me to Your holy mountain and to Your dwelling places.  
4 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy,
    and I will praise You with the lyre, O God, my God.


5 Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me?
    Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him, my salvation and my God.




Chapter 44


1 O God, with our ears we have heard—our fathers have told us—
    the work that you did in their days, in the days of old.  
2 You, with your own hand, drove out the nations, but them you planted;
    you afflicted the peoples, but them you set free.  
3 For it was not by their sword that they took possession of the land,
    nor did their arm save them, but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face—
    for you delighted in them.


4 You are my King, O God;
    command salvation for Jacob.  
5 Through you we push back our foes;
    through your name we trample down those who rise against us.  
6 For not in my bow do I trust, and my sword does not save me.  
7 But you have saved us from our foes and have put to shame those who hate us.  
8 In God we have boasted all day long,
    and we will give thanks to your name forever.


9 Yet you have rejected us and disgraced us, and you do not go out with our armies.  
10 You make us turn back from the foe, and those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves.  
11 You make us like sheep for slaughter and have scattered us among the nations.  
12 You sell your people for nothing and have gained no profit from their sale.  
13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those around us.  
14 You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.  
15 All day long my disgrace is before me, and the shame of my face covers me  
16 because of the voice of the one who taunts and reviles, because of the enemy and the avenger.


17 All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you,
    nor have we been false to your covenant.  
18 Our heart has not turned back,
    nor have our steps departed from your way,  
19 though you have crushed us in the place of jackals
    and covered us with deep darkness.


20 If we had forgotten the name of our God
    or spread out our hands to a foreign god,  
21 would not God discover this?
    For he knows the secrets of the heart.  
22 Yet for your sake we are killed all day long;
    we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.


23 Awake! Why do you sleep, O Lord?
    Arise! Do not reject us forever.  
24 Why do you hide your face?
    Why do you forget our affliction and oppression?  
25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust;
    our belly clings to the ground.  
26 Rise up; come to our help.
    Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love.




Chapter 45


1 My heart overflows with a good theme;
    I address my verses to the king;
    my tongue is the pen of a skillful scribe.
2 You are fairer than the sons of men;
    grace is poured upon your lips;
    therefore God has blessed you forever.
3 Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendor and your majesty!


4 And in your majesty ride forth victoriously for the cause of truth and humility and righteousness;
    let your right hand teach you awesome deeds.


5 Your arrows are sharp—nations fall under you—the arrows are in the heart of the king’s enemies.
6 Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.
7 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy above your companions.
8 All your garments are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia;
    from ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad.


9 Daughters of kings are among your noble women;
    at your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.


10 Listen, O daughter, and see, and incline your ear:
    forget your people and your father’s house,


11 and the king will desire your beauty.
    Bow to him, for he is your lord.


12 And the daughter of Tyre will come with a gift;
    the wealthy of the people will seek your favor.


13 The king’s daughter is all glorious within;
    her clothing is interwoven with gold.


14 In embroidered garments she is led to the king;
    the virgins, her companions who follow her, are brought to you.


15 They are led with joy and gladness;
    they enter into the palace of the king.


16 In place of your fathers will be your sons;
    you shall make them princes in all the earth.


17 I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations;
    therefore the nations will praise you forever and ever.




Chapter 46
1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea;
3 though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble at its swelling. Selah
4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy dwelling place of the Most High.
5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be shaken; God will help her at the break of dawn.
6 The nations rage, kingdoms totter; He raises His voice, the earth melts.
7 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
8 Come, behold the works of the Lord, how He has brought desolations on the earth.
9 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; He burns the chariots with fire.
10 “Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted on the earth.”
11 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah


Chapter 47


1 Clap your hands, all you nations;
shout to God with a ringing voice of joy.
2 For the LORD Most High is to be feared,
a great King over all the earth.


3 He subdues nations under us
and peoples beneath our feet.
4 He chooses our inheritance for us,
the pride of Jacob, whom He loves. Selah


5 God has gone up with a shout,
the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
6 Sing praises to God, sing praises;
sing praises to our King, sing praises.


7 For God is the King of all the earth;
sing a psalm of understanding.
8 God reigns over the nations;
God sits on His holy throne.


9 The nobles of the peoples gather
as the people of the God of Abraham;
for the shields of the earth belong to God—
He is greatly exalted.




Chapter 48


1 Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in His holy mountain.
2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Mount Zion on the far north, the city of the great King.


3 God is in her citadels; He is known as her refuge.
4 For behold, the kings assembled, they passed by together.


5 They saw it, then they were astounded; they were dismayed and fled in panic.
6 Trembling seized them there, anguish like that of a woman in labor.


7 With the east wind You shattered the ships of Tarshish.
8 Just as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish her forever. Selah.


9 We have meditated on Your loyal love, O God, in the midst of Your temple.
10 As is Your name, O God, so is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness.


11 Let Mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah exult because of Your judgments.
12 Walk around Zion, go all around her; count her towers.


13 Consider her ramparts, examine her citadels, so that you may tell the next generation,
14 that this is God, our God forever and ever; He will guide us beyond death.




Chapter 49


1 Hear this, all nations;
give ear, all inhabitants of the world,  
2 both low and high, rich and poor together.  
3 My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.  
4 I will incline my ear to a proverb;
I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre.


5 Why should I fear in days of evil, when the iniquity of my foes surrounds me,  
6 those who trust in their wealth and boast in the abundance of their riches?  
7 A brother can by no means redeem;
a man cannot give to God a ransom for him—  
8 for the redemption of their soul is costly, and he must abandon the attempt forever—  
9 so that he should live on forever and not see the pit.


10 For he sees that wise men die; likewise the fool and the senseless perish, and leave their wealth to others.  
11 Their graves are their houses forever, their dwelling places from generation to generation, though they had named lands after themselves.  
12 But man, though in honor, does not endure; he is like the beasts that perish.


13 This is the path of those who are foolish, and of those after them who approve of their sayings. Selah.  
14 Like sheep they are appointed for the grave; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in the morning. Their form shall waste away in the grave, far from their lofty abode.


15 But God will redeem my soul from the hand of the grave, for He will receive me. Selah.


16 Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases.  
17 For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not descend after him.  
18 Though he blesses himself during his life— and though men praise you when you prosper—  
19 he shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see the light.


20 A man who is honored yet does not understand is like the beasts that perish.




Chapter 50


1 The Mighty One, God, the LORD, has spoken and summoned the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.  
2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shone forth.  
3 Our God comes and does not keep silence; a fire devours before Him, and around Him a mighty tempest rages.  
4 He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that He may judge His people:  
5 "Gather to Me My faithful ones, those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice."  
6 And the heavens declare His righteousness, for God Himself is judge. Selah.


7 "Hear, O My people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God.  
8 Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before Me.  
9 I will not take a bull from your house, nor goats from your folds.  
10 For every beast of the forest is Mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.  
11 I know all the birds of the mountains, and everything that moves in the field is Mine.  
12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are Mine.  
13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?


14 Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and fulfill your vows to the Most High.  
15 And call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me."


16 But to the wicked God says: "What right have you to recite My statutes or to take My covenant on your lips?  
17 For you hate discipline, and you cast My words behind you.  
18 When you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers.  
19 You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit.  
20 You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son.  
21 These things you have done, and I kept silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before your eyes.


22 Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver.  
23 He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me; and to him who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God."




Chapter 51


1 Have mercy on me, O God, according to Your steadfast love; according to the greatness of Your compassion, blot out my transgressions.  
2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.  
3 For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.  
4 Against You, and You alone, I have sinned, and have done what is evil in Your sight, so that You are justified when You speak, and blameless when You judge.


5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me.  
6 Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden place You make me know wisdom.


7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  
8 Let me hear joy and gladness; let my bones, which You have crushed, rejoice.  
9 Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.


10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.  
11 Do not cast me away from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.  
12 Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.


13 Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners shall return to You.


14 Deliver me from bloodguilt, O God, God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of Your righteousness.  
15 O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.


16 For You do not desire sacrifice, or I would give it; You do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.  
17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.


18 Do good to Zion in Your good pleasure; build the walls of Jerusalem.  
19 Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, in burnt offering and whole burnt offering; then bulls will be offered on Your altar.




Chapter 52


1 Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man?  
The steadfast love of God endures all day long.  
2 Your tongue devises destruction,  
like a sharpened razor, working deceit.
3 You love evil more than good,  
lying more than speaking righteousness. Selah  


4 You love all devouring words,  
O deceitful tongue.
5 God will break you down forever;  
He will snatch you and tear you from your tent;  
He will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah  


6 The righteous shall see and fear,  
and shall laugh at him, saying,
7 “Behold the man who did not make God his refuge,  
but trusted in the abundance of his riches,  
and grew strong through his wickedness.”
8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God;  
I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever.
9 I will give thanks to You forever for what You have done;  
I will wait on Your name, for it is good,  
in the presence of Your faithful ones. 




Chapter 53


1 The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”  
They are corrupt, and they have committed abominable injustice;  
there is none who does good.
2 God looks down from heaven upon the sons of man  
to see if there is one who understands, who seeks God.
3 All of them have turned aside; together they have become corrupt;  
there is none who does good, not even one.


4 Do they not understand—those who work iniquity,  
who devour My people as they eat bread,  
and do not call upon God?


5 There they were in great terror, where there was no terror,  
for God scattered the bones of those who encamped against you;  
you put them to shame, for God rejected them.


6 Oh that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!  
When God restores the fortunes of His people,  
Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.  




Chapter 54


For the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, “Is not David hiding among us?”


1 O God, save me by Your name,
and by Your might vindicate me.
2 O God, hear my prayer;
give ear to the words of my mouth.


3 For strangers have risen against me,
and ruthless men seek my life;
they have not set God before them.


4 Behold, God is my helper;
the Lord is the upholder of my soul.
5 He will repay the evil to my foes;
in Your faithfulness, put an end to them.


6 With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to You;
I will give thanks to Your name, O LORD, for it is good.
7 For from every distress He has delivered me,
and my eye has looked in triumph upon my enemies.




Chapter 55


1 Give ear to my prayer, O God,
and do not hide Yourself from my supplication.
2 Attend to me and answer me;
I am restless in my complaint and I moan,
3 because of the voice of the enemy,
because of the oppression of the wicked.
For they cast iniquity upon me,
and in anger they bear a grudge against me.


4 My heart writhes within me,
and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
5 Fear and trembling come upon me,
and horror has overwhelmed me.
6 And I say, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove!
I would fly away and be at rest.
7 Behold, I would flee far away;
I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah

8 I would hasten my escape
from the stormy wind and tempest.”
9 Confuse, O Lord, divide their tongues,
for I see violence and strife in the city.
10 Day and night they go around it on its walls,
and iniquity and trouble are within it;
11 destruction is within it;
oppression and deceit do not depart from its public square.


12 For it is not an enemy who reproaches me—then I could bear it;
it is not one who hates me who exalts himself against me—then I could hide from him.
13 But it is you, a man my equal,
my companion and my familiar friend.
14 We used to take sweet counsel together;
within the house of God we walked in the throng.


15 Let death come upon them;
let them go down alive into the grave,
for evil is in their dwelling, in their midst.


16 But I, I call to God,
and the LORD will save me.
17 Evening and morning and at noon I complain and moan,
and He hears my voice.
18 He redeems my soul in peace from the battle against me,
for many are against me.
19 God will hear and humble them,
He who is enthroned from of old. Selah

Because they do not change
and do not fear God.
20 My companion has stretched out his hand against those at peace with him;
he has violated his covenant.
21 His speech was smoother than butter,
but war was in his heart;
his words were softer than oil,
yet they were drawn swords.


22 Cast your burden on the LORD, and He will sustain you;
He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.
23 But You, O God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction;
men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days.
But as for me, I will trust in You.




Chapter 56


1 Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples me;
all day long an attacker oppresses me.
2 My foes trample upon me all day long,
for many are attacking me proudly.
3 When I am afraid, I will trust in you.


4 In God, whose word I praise—in God I trust;
I will not be afraid. What can flesh do to me?


5 All day long they twist my words;
all their thoughts are against me for evil.
6 They stir up strife, they lurk,
they watch my steps, as they have waited for my life.
7 Shall they escape in spite of their wrongdoing?
In anger, O God, bring down the nations.


8 You have kept count of my wanderings;
put my tears in your bottle—are they not in your book?
9 Then my enemies will turn back on the day I call;
this I know, that God is for me.


10 In God, whose word I praise,
in the Lord, whose word I praise,
11 in God I trust; I will not be afraid.
What can man do to me?


12 My vows to you, O God, are binding upon me;
I will render thank offerings to you.
13 For you have delivered my soul from death,
yes, my feet from stumbling,
that I may walk before God in the light of life.




Chapter 57


1 Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me,
for in you my soul takes refuge;
in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge,
until destruction passes by.
2 I cry out to God Most High,
to God who accomplishes all things for me.
3 He will send from heaven and save me;
he will reproach him who tramples upon me. Selah.
God will send forth his mercy and his truth.
4 My soul is in the midst of lions;
I lie down among those who devour with fire—
sons of man whose teeth are spears and arrows,
whose tongue is a sharp sword.
5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God;
let your glory be above all the earth.
6 They set a net for my steps;
my soul was bowed down.
They dug a pit before me;
yet they fell into it themselves. Selah.
7 My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast;
I will sing and make melody.
8 Awake, my glory!
Awake, harp and lyre!
I will awaken the dawn.
9 I will give thanks to you among the nations, O Lord;
I will sing praises to you among the peoples.
10 For your mercy is great unto the heavens,
and your truth unto the clouds.
11 Be exalted above the heavens, O God;
let your glory be above all the earth.




Chapter 58


1 Do you indeed speak righteousness, O mighty ones?
Do you judge uprightly, O sons of man?
2 No, in your heart you work unrighteousness;
with your hands you deal out violence on the earth.


3 The wicked are estranged from the womb;
they go astray from birth, speaking lies.
4 Their venom is like the venom of a serpent,
like a deaf viper that stops its ear,
5 so that it does not hear the voice of charmers,
or of a cunning enchanter.


6 O God, break the teeth in their mouths;
tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD.
7 Let them vanish like water that flows away;
when he aims his arrows, let them be as though cut off.
8 Let them be like a snail that melts away as it moves,
like the stillborn child of a woman who never sees the sun.


9 Before your pots can feel the heat of thorns,
whether green or burning, he will sweep them away.


10 The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance;
he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
11 And man will say, “Surely there is a reward for the righteous;
surely there is a God who judges on the earth.”




Chapter 59


1 Deliver me from my enemies, O my God;
set me on high from those who rise up against me.
2 Deliver me from those who work evil, and save me from men of blood.


3 For behold, they lie in wait for my life;
fierce men stir up strife against me,
not for my transgression nor for my sin, O LORD.
4 Without guilt of mine, they run and prepare themselves;
awake to meet me, and see!


5 You, O LORD God of hosts, God of Israel,
rouse yourself to punish all the nations;
show no mercy to any treacherous evildoers. Selah.


6 They return at evening, they howl like dogs,
and go around the city.
7 Behold, they belch with their mouths;
swords are in their lips—“For who hears?” they say.


8 But you, O LORD, will laugh at them;
you will hold all the nations in derision.
9 O my Strength, I will watch for you,
for God is my high fortress.


10 My God in his steadfast love will meet me;
God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.


11 Do not kill them, lest my people forget;
make them wander by your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.
12 For the sin of their mouth, the word of their lips,
let them be trapped in their pride;
and for cursing and lies that they utter,
13 consume them in wrath, consume them till they are no more,
that they may know that God rules in Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah.


14 They return at evening, they howl like dogs, and go around the city.
15 They wander about for food, and growl if they are not satisfied.


16 But I will sing of your strength;
in the morning I will sing aloud of your mercy.
For you have been a fortress for me and a refuge in the day of my distress.
17 O my Strength, I will sing praises to you,
for God is my high fortress,
the God who shows me steadfast love.




Chapter 60


1 O God, you have rejected us, broken us; you have been angry—restore us.
2 You have made the land tremble; you have torn it open. Heal its fractures, for it is tottering.
3 You have shown your people hard things; you have given us wine to stagger us.


4 You have set up a banner for those who fear you, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
5 That your beloved ones may be delivered, save with your right hand and answer us.


6 God has spoken in his holiness: “I will exult; I will divide Shechem and measure out the Valley of Succoth.
7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is the helmet of my head; Judah is my scepter.
8 Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”


9 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
10 Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go out, O God, with our armies.
11 Give us help against the foe, for the help of man is worthless.
12 Through God we shall do valiantly, and he will tread down our foes.




Chapter 61


1 Hear my cry, O God;
attend to my prayer.
2 From the end of the earth
I call to you when my heart is faint;
lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
3 For you have been a refuge for me,
a strong tower against the enemy.


4 Let me dwell in your tent forever;
let me take refuge in the shelter of your wings.
5 For you, O God, have heard my vows;
you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.


6 You will add days to the king’s life;
his years will be as many generations.
7 He will abide before God forever;
appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to guard him.


8 So I will sing praise to your name forever,
that I may fulfill my vows day after day.




Chapter 62


1 My soul waits in silence for God alone;
from him comes my salvation.
2 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress—
I shall not be greatly shaken.


3 How long will you assail a man, all of you,
to break him down, like a leaning wall, a tottering fence?
4 Surely they plan to cast him down from his high place;
they take pleasure in falsehood.
They bless with their mouths,
but inwardly they curse.


5 My soul, wait in silence for God alone,
for my hope is from him.
6 He alone is my rock and my salvation,
my fortress—I shall not be shaken.
7 On God rests my salvation and my glory;
the rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.


8 Trust in him at all times, O men;
pour out your heart before him;
God is a refuge for us.


9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of rank are a lie;
in the balances they go up—they are altogether lighter than a breath.
10 Do not trust in oppression, and do not set vain hopes in robbery;
if riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.


11 God has spoken once, twice I have heard this:
that power belongs to God,
12 and to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love.
For you repay each man according to his work.




Chapter 63


1 O God, you are my God—earnestly I seek you;
my soul thirsts for you, my flesh faints for you,
in a dry and weary land without water.
2 So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,
beholding your power and your glory.
3 Because your steadfast love is better than life,
my lips will praise you.
4 So I will bless you as long as I live;
in your name I will lift up my hands.


5 My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness,
and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips,
6 when I remember you on my bed
and meditate on you in the night watches.
7 For you have been my help,
and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.
8 My soul clings to you;
your right hand upholds me.


9 But those who seek to destroy my life
will go down into the depths of the earth;
10 they shall be given over to the sword;
they shall be a portion for jackals.
11 But the king will rejoice in God;
everyone who swears by him will exult,
for the mouth of liars will be stopped.




Chapter 64


1 Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint;
preserve my life from the terror of the enemy.
2 Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked,
from the throng of evildoers,
3 who sharpen their tongue like a sword,
who aim bitter words like arrows,
4 to shoot from ambush at the innocent;
they shoot suddenly, without fear.


5 They hold fast to their evil purpose;
they talk of laying hidden snares;
they say, “Who will see them?”
6 They plot injustice, saying, “We have devised a perfect plan!”
For the inward mind and heart of man are deep.


7 But God will shoot them with an arrow;
suddenly they will be struck down.
8 Their own tongue will bring them ruin;
all who see them will shake their heads.
9 Then all men will fear;
they will declare the work of God
and consider what he has done.
10 The righteous will rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him,
and all the upright in heart will glory.




Chapter 65


1 Praise waits for you, O God, in Zion,
and to you shall the vow be fulfilled.
2 O you who hear prayer,
to you all flesh will come.
3 Iniquities prevail against me—
our transgressions, you will atone for them.
4 Blessed is the man you choose and bring near, to dwell in your courts.
We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house, the holiness of your temple.


5 By awesome deeds in righteousness you answer us,
O God of our salvation,
the confidence of all the ends of the earth
and of the farthest sea,
6 who establishes the mountains by his strength,
being girded with might,
7 who stills the roaring of the seas,
the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the nations.
8 Those who dwell at the ends of the earth stand in awe of your signs;
you make the going out of the morning and the evening to shout for joy.


9 You visit the earth and water it, you greatly enrich it;
the river of God is full of water; you provide their grain, for so you have prepared it.
10 You water its furrows abundantly, settling its ridges,
softening it with showers, blessing its growth.
11 You crown the year with your goodness,
and your paths drip with abundance.
12 The pastures of the wilderness drip,
and the hills gird themselves with joy.
13 The meadows are clothed with flocks, and the valleys are covered with grain;
they shout and sing together for joy.




Chapter 66


1 Shout joyfully to God, all the earth.
2 Sing the glory of His name;
make His praise glorious.
3 Say to God, “How awesome are Your works!
Because of the greatness of Your power,
Your enemies come bowing before You.
4 All the earth will worship You and sing praises to You;
they will sing praises to Your name.”


5 Come and see the works of God;
He is awesome in His deeds toward the sons of man.
6 He turned the sea into dry land;
they passed through the river on foot;
Let us rejoice in Him there.
7 He rules by His own power forever;
His eyes keep watch on the nations;
let not the rebellious exalt themselves.


8 Bless our God, O peoples,
and sound aloud the voice of His praise,
9 who keeps our soul in life
and does not allow our foot to slip.
10 For You have tested us, O God;
You have refined us as silver is refined.
11 You brought us into the net;
You laid a burden upon our loins.
12 You made men ride over our heads;
we went through fire and through water,
but You brought us out to a place of abundance.


13 I shall come into Your house with burnt offerings;
I shall pay You my vows,
14 which my lips uttered
and my mouth spoke when I was in distress.
15 I shall offer to You burnt offerings of fatlings,
with the smoke of rams;
I shall offer bulls with male goats.


16 Come and hear, all who fear God,
and I will declare what He has done for my soul.
17 I cried to Him with my mouth,
and He was glorified by my tongue.
18 If I had regarded iniquity in my heart,
the Lord would not have heard.
19 But surely God has heard;
He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.
20 Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer
nor His lovingkindness from me.




Chapter 67


1 May God be gracious to us and bless us,
and cause His face to shine upon us,
2 that Your way may be known on the earth,
Your salvation among all nations.


3 Let the peoples praise You, O God;
let all the peoples praise You.
4 Let the nations be glad and sing for joy,
for You will judge the peoples with uprightness
and guide the nations on the earth.


5 Let the peoples praise You, O God;
let all the peoples praise You.


6 The earth has yielded its produce;
God, our God, will bless us.
7 God will bless us,
and all the ends of the earth will fear Him.




Chapter 68


1 Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered;
and let those who hate Him flee before Him.
2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away;
as wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish before God.
3 But the righteous shall be glad;
they shall rejoice before God and exult with joy.


4 Sing to God, sing praises to His name;
lift up a song to Him who rides through the deserts—
His name is the LORD—exult before Him.
5 A father to the fatherless and a judge for the widows
is God in His holy habitation.
6 God sets the solitary in families;
He brings out those who are bound with chains,
but the rebellious dwell in a parched land.


7 O God, when You went out before Your people,
when You marched through the wilderness—Selah
8 The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God;
Sinai itself quaked at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
9 You caused abundant rain to fall, O God;
You confirmed Your inheritance when it was weary.
10 Your congregation dwelled in it;
You, O God, prepared it in Your goodness for the poor.


11 The Lord gives the command;
great is the company of those who proclaim it.
12 Kings of armies flee—they flee!
And she who remains at home divides the spoil.
13 Though you lie among the sheepfolds,
the wings of a dove are covered with silver,
and its pinions with shimmering gold.
14 When the Almighty scattered kings there, it snowed on Zalmon.


15 A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan;
a mountain of many peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
16 Why do you look with envy, O mountains of many peaks,
at the mountain which God has desired for His dwelling?
Yes, the LORD will dwell there forever.
17 The chariots of God are twice ten thousand, thousands upon thousands;
the Lord is among them at Sinai in holiness.
18 You have ascended on high, You have led captive captives;
You have received gifts among men, even among the rebellious,
that the LORD God might dwell there.


19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears us up;
God is our salvation. Selah
20 Our God is a God of deliverances,
and to the LORD, the Lord, belongs escape from death.
21 But God will shatter the heads of His enemies,
the hairy scalp of him who walks in guilt.


22 The Lord said, “I will bring them back from Bashan,
I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,
23 that your foot may shatter them in blood,
the tongue of your dogs may have its share from the enemies.”


24 They have seen Your processions, O God,
the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
25 The singers went before, the musicians followed after,
in the midst were maidens playing tambourines.
26 Bless God in the congregations, the LORD,
O you who are from the fountain of Israel.
27 There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling over them,
the princes of Judah in their throng, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.


28 Your God has commanded your strength;
show Yourself strong, O God, as You have done for us before.
29 Because of Your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring gifts to You.
30 Rebuke the beasts of the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples, trampling underfoot the pieces of silver;
He has scattered the peoples who delight in war.
31 Envoys will come out of Egypt;
Cush will hasten to stretch out her hands to God.


32 Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth;
sing praises to the Lord—Selah
33 To Him who rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens;
behold, He sends out His voice, a mighty voice.
34 Ascribe strength to God;
His majesty is over Israel, and His strength is in the skies.
35 O God, You are awesome from Your sanctuary;
the God of Israel gives strength and power to the people. Blessed be God!




Chapter 69


1 Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.
2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no footing;
I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me.
3 I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched;
my eyes fail while I wait for my God.


4 More numerous than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause;
mighty are those who would destroy me, my enemies falsely;
what I did not steal, I must restore.
5 O God, you know my folly,
and my guilt is not hidden from you.


6 Let not those who wait for you be put to shame through me, O Lord GOD of hosts;
let not those who seek you be dishonored through me, O God of Israel.
7 For it is for your sake that I have borne reproach,
that shame has covered my face.
8 I have become a stranger to my brothers,
and an alien to my mother’s sons.
9 For zeal for your house has consumed me,
and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.


10 When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting,
it became my reproach.
11 When I made sackcloth my clothing,
I became a byword to them.
12 Those who sit in the gate speak against me,
and I am the song of the drunkards.


13 But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD, at an acceptable time;
O God, in the abundance of your steadfast love, answer me in your saving faithfulness.
14 Deliver me from the mire, and do not let me sink;
let me be delivered from those who hate me, and from the deep waters.
15 Do not let the flood sweep over me,
or the deep swallow me up,
or the pit close its mouth over me.


16 Answer me, O LORD, for your steadfast love is good;
according to your abundant mercy, turn to me.
17 Do not hide your face from your servant,
for I am in distress; make haste to answer me.
18 Draw near to my soul and redeem it;
ransom me because of my enemies.


19 You know my reproach, and my shame and my dishonor;
my adversaries are all before you.
20 Reproach has broken my heart, and I am in despair.
I looked for pity, but there was none,
and for comforters, but I found none.
21 They gave me poison for food,
and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.


22 Let their table before them become a snare,
and when they are at peace, let it become a trap.
23 Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,
and make their loins tremble continually.
24 Pour out your indignation upon them,
and let your burning anger overtake them.
25 May their camp be desolate;
let no one dwell in their tents.


26 For they persecute him whom you have struck down,
and they recount the pain of those you have wounded.
27 Add guilt to their guilt,
and let them not come into your righteousness.
28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living;
let them not be enrolled among the righteous.


29 But I am afflicted and in pain;
let your salvation, O God, set me on high.
30 I will praise the name of God with a song;
I will magnify him with thanksgiving.
31 This will please the LORD more than an ox,
or a bull with horns and hoofs.


32 The humble will see and be glad;
you who seek God, let your hearts revive.
33 For the LORD hears the needy
and does not despise his own who are prisoners.


34 Let heaven and earth praise him,
the seas and everything that moves in them.
35 For God will save Zion
and build the cities of Judah,
and they shall dwell there and possess it;
36 the offspring of his servants shall inherit it,
and those who love his name shall dwell in it.




Chapter 70


1 O God, hasten to deliver me;
O LORD, make haste to help me.
2 Let those who seek my life be put to shame and confounded;
let those who desire my harm be turned back and humiliated.
3 Let those who say, “Aha! Aha!” turn back because of their shame.
4 Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you;
and let those who love your salvation say continually, “God is great!”
5 But I am afflicted and needy;
O God, hasten to me!
You are my help and my deliverer;
O LORD, do not delay.




Chapter 71


1 In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge;
let me never be put to shame.
2 In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me;
incline your ear to me and save me.
3 Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may continually come;
you have given the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.


4 Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked,
from the grasp of the unjust and cruel man.
5 For you are my hope, O Lord GOD, my trust from my youth.
6 Upon you I have leaned from before my birth;
you are the one who took me from my mother’s womb.
My praise is continually of you.


7 I have been as a wonder to many,
but you are my strong refuge.
8 My mouth is filled with your praise,
and with your glory all day long.


9 Do not cast me off in the time of old age;
do not forsake me when my strength is spent.
10 For my enemies speak against me,
and those who watch for my life conspire together,
11 saying, “God has forsaken him;
pursue and seize him, for there is none to deliver.”
12 O God, do not be far from me;
O my God, make haste to help me.
13 Let those who are adversaries of my soul be put to shame and consumed;
let those who seek to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace.


14 But as for me, I will hope continually,
and I will praise you yet more and more.
15 My mouth will recount your righteousness,
your salvation all day long, for I do not know their extent.
16 I will come with the mighty deeds of the Lord GOD;
I will make mention of your righteousness, yours alone.


17 O God, you have taught me from my youth,
and to this day I declare your wondrous deeds.
18 Even when I am old and gray, O God, do not forsake me,
until I declare your strength to the next generation, your might to all who are to come.


19 Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the heavens,
you who have done great things;
O God, who is like you?
20 You who have shown me many troubles and calamities will revive me again;
from the depths of the earth you will bring me up again.
21 You will increase my greatness and comfort me once again.


22 I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God;
I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
23 My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to you,
and my soul, which you have redeemed.
24 My tongue also will speak of your righteousness all day long,
for those who seek to harm me are put to shame and disgraced.




Chapter 72


1 Give the king your judgments, O God,
and your righteousness to the son of the king.
2 May he judge your people with righteousness,
and your afflicted with justice.
3 Let the mountains bring peace to the people,
and the hills, righteousness.
4 May he bring justice to the afflicted of the people,
save the children of the needy,
and crush the oppressor.


5 Let them fear you while the sun endures,
and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
6 May he be like rain that falls on the mown grass,
like showers that water the earth.
7 In his days may the righteous flourish,
and abundance of peace until the moon is no more.


8 May he have dominion from sea to sea,
and from the River to the ends of the earth.
9 Let those who dwell in the desert bow before him,
and his enemies lick the dust.
10 May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render tribute,
the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts.
11 Let all kings bow down before him,
all nations serve him.


12 For he delivers the needy when he cries,
the afflicted also, and him who has no helper.
13 He has pity on the poor and needy,
and the souls of the needy he saves.
14 From oppression and violence he redeems their soul,
and precious is their blood in his sight.


15 May he live, and may the gold of Sheba be given to him;
may prayer be made for him continually,
and blessings invoked for him all day long.
16 May there be abundance of grain in the land,
on the tops of the mountains may it wave;
may its fruit be like Lebanon,
and may men flourish from the city like the grass of the earth.


17 May his name endure forever,
may his name continue as long as the sun;
and may men be blessed in him,
all nations call him blessed.


18 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel,
who alone does wondrous things.
19 And blessed be his glorious name forever;
and may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.


20 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.




Chapter 73


1 Truly God is good to Israel,
to those who are pure in heart.
2 But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled;
my steps had nearly slipped.
3 For I was envious of the arrogant,
when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.


4 For they have no pains until death,
and their bodies are fat and sleek.
5 They are not in trouble as other men are;
they are not plagued like the rest of mankind.
6 Therefore pride is their necklace;
violence covers them like a garment.
7 Their eyes bulge with abundance;
the imaginations of their heart overflow.
8 They scoff and speak with malice;
loftily they threaten oppression.
9 They set their mouths against the heavens,
and their tongues strut through the earth.


10 Therefore his people turn back to them,
and waters of fullness are drained by them.
11 And they say, “How does God know?
And is there knowledge in the Most High?”
12 Behold, these are the wicked—
always at ease, they increase in wealth.


13 Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure
and washed my hands in innocence.
14 For all day long I am afflicted
and every morning brings punishment.


15 If I had said, “I will speak thus,”
behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.
16 But when I pondered to understand this,
it was trouble in my eyes,
17 until I came into the sanctuary of God;
then I understood their end.


18 Truly you set them in slippery places;
you make them fall to ruin.
19 How suddenly they are brought to desolation,
swept away in terrors!
20 Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord,
when you rouse yourself, you despise their image.


21 When my heart was embittered
and I was pierced in my inward parts,
22 I was brutish and ignorant;
I was like a beast before you.
23 Yet I am continually with you;
you hold my right hand.
24 You guide me with your counsel,
and afterward you will receive me to glory.


25 Whom have I in heaven but you?
And there is nothing on earth I desire besides you.
26 My flesh and my heart may fail,
but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.


27 For behold, those who are far from you will perish;
you destroy everyone who is unfaithful to you.
28 But as for me, the nearness of God is my good;
I have made the Lord GOD my refuge,
that I may tell of all your works.




Chapter 74


1 O God, why have you rejected us forever?
Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?
2 Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,
the tribe of your inheritance, whom you redeemed—Mount Zion, where you have dwelled.
3 Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins;
the enemy has laid waste everything in the sanctuary.


4 Your foes have roared in the midst of your meeting place;
they have set up their signs for signs.
5 It was as if one raised an axe in a forest of trees,
6 and now all its carved work they smash with hatchet and hammers.
7 They have set your sanctuary on fire;
they have profaned the dwelling place of your name, bringing it to the ground.
8 They said in their heart, “Let us completely subdue them!”
They burned all the meeting places of God in the land.


9 We do not see our signs;
there is no longer any prophet,
and none among us knows for how long.
10 How long, O God, is the foe to scoff?
Is the enemy to revile your name forever?
11 Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?
Draw it from your bosom and destroy them!


12 Yet God is my king of old,
working salvation in the midst of the earth.
13 You divided the sea by your strength;
you broke the heads of the sea monsters on the waters.
14 You crushed the head of Leviathan;
you gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.
15 You split open springs and brooks;
you dried up ever-flowing streams.
16 Yours is the day, yours also the night;
you have established the light and the sun.
17 You have set all the boundaries of the earth;
you have made summer and winter.


18 Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy scoffs,
And how a foolish people reviles your name.
19 Do not give the soul of your dove to the wild beast;
do not forget the life of your afflicted forever.
20 Have regard for the covenant,
for the dark places of the land are full of the haunts of violence.
21 Let not the oppressed turn back in shame;
let the afflicted and needy praise your name.


22 Arise, O God, plead your cause;
remember how the foolish man scoffs at you all day long.
23 Do not forget the clamor of your foes,
the uproar of those who rise up against you, which ascends continually.




Chapter 75


1 We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks,
for your name is near; men recount your wondrous deeds.


2 When I choose the appointed time,
I judge with equity.
3 When the earth and all its inhabitants tremble,
it is I who steady its pillars. Selah


4 I say to the boastful, “Do not boast,”
and to the wicked, “Do not lift up the horn.
5 Do not lift up your horn on high,
do not speak with an arrogant neck.”


6 For lifting people up does not come from the east or from the west,
Neither from the wilderness,
7 but God is the judge:
he brings one down and lifts up another.


8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup,
with foaming wine, fully mixed,
and he pours out from it,
and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.


9 But I will declare it forever;
I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
10 And all the horns of the wicked I will cut off,
but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.




Chapter 76


1 God is known in Judah;
his name is great in Israel.
2 His tabernacle is in Salem,
and his dwelling place in Zion.
3 There he broke the flashing arrows,
the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah


4 Glorious are you, majestic from the mountains of prey.
5 The stouthearted were plundered; they slept their sleep,
and none of the warriors could lift their hands.
6 At your rebuke, O God of Jacob,
both rider and horse lay stunned.


7 You, even you, are to be feared;
who can stand before you once your anger is aroused?
8 From heaven you pronounced judgment;
the earth feared and was still,
9 when God arose to execute judgment,
to save all the humble of the earth. Selah


10 For the wrath of man shall praise you;
with the remainder of wrath you gird yourself.
11 Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them;
let all who are around him bring tribute to the one to be feared.
12 He cuts off the spirit of princes;
he is feared by the kings of the earth.




Chapter 77


1 I cry aloud to God—aloud to God, that he may hear me.
2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord;
my hand was stretched out in the night and did not grow weary;
my soul refused to be comforted.


3 I remember God, and I moan;
I meditate, and my spirit grows faint. Selah
4 You hold open my eyelids;
I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
5 I consider the days of old,
the years of long ago.
6 I call to mind my song in the night;
I meditate with my heart,
and my spirit searches diligently:


7 “Will the Lord spurn forever,
and never again show favor?
8 Has his loyal love ceased forever?
Has his promise come to an end for all time?
9 Has God forgotten to be gracious?
Has he shut up his compassion in anger?” Selah


10 Then I said, “It is my grief,
that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”


11 I will remember the deeds of the LORD;
yes, I will remember your wonders of old.
12 I will meditate on all your work
and ponder your mighty deeds.
13 Your way, O God, is holy.
What god is great like God?


14 You are the God who works wonders;
you have made known your might among the nations.
15 With your arm you redeemed your people,
the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah


16 The waters saw you, O God;
the waters saw you—and they writhed;
even the depths trembled.
17 The clouds poured out water;
the skies gave forth a sound;
your arrows flashed to and fro.


18 The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind;
lightnings lit up the world;
the earth trembled and shook.
19 Your way was through the sea,
and your path through the great waters,
yet your footprints were unseen.


20 You led your people like a flock
by the hand of Moses and Aaron.




Chapter 78


1 Give ear, O my people, to my instruction;
incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
2 I will open my mouth with a parable;
I will utter hidden sayings of old,
3 which we have heard and known,
and our fathers have told us.
4 We will not hide them from their children,
telling to the next generation the praises of the LORD,
and his strength and his wondrous deeds that he has done.


5 For he established a testimony in Jacob
and set a law in Israel,
which he commanded our fathers to teach their children,
6 so that the next generation might know them—
the children yet to be born—
that they might arise and tell them to their children,
7 that they might put their trust in God
and not forget the works of God,
but keep his commandments;
8 and not be like their fathers,
a stubborn and rebellious generation,
a generation that did not set its heart aright,
and whose spirit was not faithful to God.


9 The sons of Ephraim, armed with the bow,
turned back on the day of battle.
10 They did not keep the covenant of God
and refused to walk in his law.
11 They forgot his deeds
and his wonders that he had shown them.


12 He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,
in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.
13 He divided the sea and caused them to pass through,
and he made the waters stand like a heap.
14 He led them with a cloud by day
and all the night with a light of fire.
15 He split rocks in the wilderness
and gave them abundant drink as from the deep.
16 He brought streams out of the rock
and caused waters to flow down like rivers.


17 Yet they continued to sin against him,
to rebel against the Most High in the desert.
18 They tested God in their heart
by demanding food to satisfy their cravings.
19 They spoke against God, saying,
“Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
20 See how he struck the rock so that water gushed out
and streams overflowed.
Can he also give bread
or provide meat for his people?”


21 Therefore the LORD heard and was full of wrath;
a fire was kindled against Jacob,
and anger also rose against Israel,
22 because they did not believe in God
and did not trust in his salvation.
23 Yet he commanded the skies above
and opened the doors of heaven.
24 He rained down manna upon them to eat
and gave them the grain of heaven.
25 Man ate the bread of angels;
he sent them food in abundance.


26 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens,
and by his power he led out the south wind.
27 He rained meat upon them like dust,
and winged birds like the sand of the seas.
28 He made them fall in the midst of their camp,
all around their dwellings.
29 So they ate and were well filled,
and he gave them what they craved.
30 But before they had satisfied their craving,
while the food was still in their mouths,
31 the anger of God rose against them,
and he killed the strongest of them
and laid low the young men of Israel.


32 In spite of all this they still sinned
and did not believe in his wondrous works.
33 So he made their days vanish like a breath,
and their years in sudden terror.
34 When he killed them, they sought him;
they returned and earnestly sought God.
35 They remembered that God was their rock,
and the Most High God their redeemer.
36 But they flattered him with their mouth,
and lied to him with their tongue.
37 For their heart was not steadfast toward him,
nor were they faithful to his covenant.


38 But he, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity
and did not destroy them.
Often he turned his anger away
and did not stir up all his wrath.
39 He remembered that they were but flesh,
a wind that passes and does not return.


40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness
and grieved him in the desert!
41 Again and again they tested God
and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
42 They did not remember his power
or the day when he redeemed them from the foe,
43 when he performed his signs in Egypt
and his wonders in the fields of Zoan.


44 He turned their rivers to blood,
so that they could not drink from their streams.
45 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them,
and frogs, which destroyed them.
46 He gave their crops to the caterpillar
and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
47 He destroyed their vines with hail
and their sycamores with frost.
48 He gave over their livestock to the hail
and their flocks to fiery bolts.


49 He sent upon them his burning anger,
wrath and indignation and distress,
a band of destroying angels.
50 He cleared a path for his anger;
he did not spare them from death
but gave their lives over to the plague.
51 He struck all the firstborn in Egypt,
the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.


52 Then he led out his people like sheep
and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
53 He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid,
but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
54 And he brought them to his holy territory,
to the mountain which his right hand had acquired.
55 He drove out nations before them
and allotted them an inheritance by lot
and made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.


56 Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God
and did not keep his testimonies,
57 but turned back and acted treacherously like their fathers;
they twisted like a deceitful bow.
58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places
and moved him to jealousy with their idols.
59 God heard and was full of wrath,
and he utterly rejected Israel.


60 He abandoned the dwelling at Shiloh,
the tent where he had dwelled among men,
61 and he gave his strength into captivity
and his glory into the hand of the foe.
62 He gave his people over to the sword
and was furious with his inheritance.
63 Fire devoured their young men,
and their maidens had no marriage song.
64 Their priests fell by the sword,
and their widows made no lamentation.


65 Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,
like a warrior shouting because of wine.
66 And he struck his enemies back;
he put them to everlasting shame.
67 He rejected the tent of Joseph;
he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
68 but he chose the tribe of Judah,
Mount Zion, which he loved.
69 He built his sanctuary like the heights,
like the earth which he has established forever.


70 He chose David his servant
and took him from the sheepfolds;
71 from tending the ewes that nurse
he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people,
and Israel his inheritance.
72 So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart
and guided them with skillful hands.




Chapter 79


1 O God, the nations have come into your inheritance;
they have defiled your holy temple;
they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the heavens,
the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts of the earth.
3 They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem,
and there was no one to bury them.
4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors,
a mockery and derision to those around us.


5 How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever?
Will your jealousy burn like fire?
6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you,
and on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
7 For they have devoured Jacob
and laid waste his habitation.


8 Do not remember our former iniquities;
let your compassion come quickly to meet us,
for we are brought very low.
9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name;
deliver us and atone for our sins, for your name’s sake.
10 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”
Let the avenging of the blood of your servants that has been shed
be known among the nations before our eyes.


11 Let the groaning of the prisoner come before you;
according to the greatness of your power, preserve those doomed to die.
12 Return sevenfold into the lap of our neighbors
the reproach with which they have reproached you, O Lord.
13 But we, your people and the sheep of your pasture,
will give thanks to you forever;
from generation to generation we will recount your praise.




Chapter 80


1 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
you who lead Joseph like a flock.
You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth
2 before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh.
Stir up your strength
and come to save us.


3 Restore us, O God,
and cause your face to shine, that we may be saved.


4 O LORD God of hosts,
how long will you be angry with the prayer of your people?
5 You have fed them with the bread of tears
and given them tears to drink in full measure.
6 You make us an object of contention to our neighbors,
and our enemies laugh among themselves.


7 Restore us, O God of hosts,
and cause your face to shine, that we may be saved.


8 You brought a vine out of Egypt;
you drove out the nations and planted it.
9 You cleared the ground for it,
and it took deep root and filled the land.
10 The mountains were covered with its shade,
and the mighty cedars with its branches.
11 It sent out its branches to the sea
and its shoots to the River.


12 Why have you broken down its walls,
so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?
13 The boar from the forest ravages it,
and all that move in the field feed on it.


14 O God of hosts, return, we pray!
Look down from heaven, and see,
and take care of this vine,
15 even the shoot your right hand has planted,
and the son whom you have made strong for yourself.
16 It is burned with fire; it is cut down;
they perish at the rebuke of your face.


17 Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand,
the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself.
18 Then we shall not turn back from you;
give us life, and we will call upon your name.


19 Restore us, O LORD God of hosts;
cause your face to shine, that we may be saved.




Chapter 81


1 Sing aloud to God our strength;
shout for joy to the God of Jacob.
2 Raise a song; sound the tambourine,
the sweet lyre with the harp.
3 Blow the trumpet at the new moon,
at the full moon, on our feast day.


4 For it is a statute for Israel,
a judgment of the God of Jacob.
5 He established it as a decree in Joseph
when he went out over the land of Egypt.
I heard a language I did not know:


6 “I relieved his shoulder of the burden;
his hands were freed from the basket.
7 In distress you called, and I delivered you;
I answered you in the secret place of thunder;
I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah


8 Hear, O my people, and I will admonish you;
O Israel, if you would but listen to me!
9 There shall be no strange god among you;
you shall not bow down to a foreign god.
10 I am the LORD your God,
who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.


11 But my people did not listen to my voice;
Israel would not submit to me.
12 So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart,
to walk in their own counsels.


13 Oh that my people would listen to me,
that Israel would walk in my ways!
14 I would soon subdue their enemies
and turn my hand against their adversaries.
15 Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him,
and their time of punishment would last forever.
16 But he would feed him with the finest of the wheat,
and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.




Chapter 82


1 God stands in the divine assembly;
in the midst of the gods he renders judgment.


2 “How long will you judge unjustly
and show partiality to the wicked? Selah
3 Give justice to the weak and the fatherless;
uphold the rights of the afflicted and the destitute.
4 Rescue the weak and the needy;
deliver them from the hand of the wicked.”


5 They have neither knowledge nor understanding;
they walk about in darkness;
all the foundations of the earth are shaken.


6 I said, “You are gods,
sons of the Most High, all of you;
7 nevertheless, like man you shall die,
and fall like any prince.”


8 Arise, O God, judge the earth,
for you shall inherit all the nations.




Chapter 83


1 O God, do not keep silent;
do not hold your peace or be still, O God.


2 Look how your enemies make an uproar;
those who hate you have lifted up their heads.
3 They devise cunning plots against your people;
they conspire against your treasured ones.
4 They say, “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation;
let the name of Israel be remembered no more!”
5 For with one mind they conspire together;
against you they make a conspiracy.


6 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
Moab and the Hagrites,
7 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
8 even Assyria has joined them;
they have become the arm of the sons of Lot. Selah


9 Do to them as to Midian,
as to Sisera and Jabin at the wadi Kishon,
10 who were destroyed at En-dor,
who became dung for the ground.
11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
12 who said, “Let us take possession
for ourselves of the pastures of God.”


13 O my God, make them like whirling dust,
like chaff before the wind.
14 As fire consumes the forest,
as flame sets the mountains ablaze,
15 so pursue them with your storm
and terrify them with your tempest.
16 Fill their faces with shame,
that they may seek your name, O LORD.
17 Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever;
let them perish in disgrace,
18 that they may know that you alone,
whose name is the LORD,
are Most High over all the earth.




Chapter 84


1 How lovely are your dwelling places,
O LORD of hosts!
2 My soul longs—indeed, it faints—for the courts of the LORD;
my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
3 Even the sparrow has found a home,
and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young—
at your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King and my God.
4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house;
they are ever praising you. Selah


5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in you,
in whose heart are the highways to Zion.
6 As they pass through the Valley of Baca,
they make it a place of springs;
the early rain also covers it with blessings.
7 They go from strength to strength;
each one appears before God in Zion.
8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer;
give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah


9 Look upon our shield, O God,
and look upon the face of your anointed.
10 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere.
I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God
than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
11 For the LORD God is a sun and a shield;
the LORD gives grace and glory;
no good thing does he withhold
from those who walk uprightly.
12 O LORD of hosts,
blessed is the man who trusts in you.




Chapter 85


1 You showed favor to your land, O LORD;
you restored the fortunes of Jacob.
2 You forgave the iniquity of your people;
you covered all their sin. Selah
3 You withdrew all your wrath;
you turned from your burning anger.
4 Restore us, O God of our salvation,
and put away your indignation toward us.


5 Will you be angry with us forever?
Will you prolong your anger from generation to generation?
6 Will you not revive us again,
that your people may rejoice in you?
7 Show us your steadfast love, O LORD,
and grant us your salvation.
8 Let me hear what God the LORD will speak,
for he will speak peace to his people, to his saints—
but let them not return to folly.


9 Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him,
that glory may dwell in our land.
10 Steadfast love and faithfulness meet;
righteousness and peace kiss each other.
11 Faithfulness springs up from the earth,
and righteousness looks down from heaven.
12 Indeed, the LORD will give what is good,
and our land will yield its produce.
13 Righteousness will go before him
and will make his footsteps a pathway.




Chapter 86


1 Incline your ear, O LORD, and answer me,
for I am afflicted and needy.
2 Preserve my life, for I am faithful;
you are my God—save your servant who trusts in you.
3 Be gracious to me, O Lord,
for I cry to you all day long.
4 Gladden the soul of your servant,
for unto you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.


5 For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving,
abounding in steadfast love to all who call on you.
6 Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer;
listen to the voice of my supplications.
7 In the day of my trouble I call on you,
for you will answer me.
8 There is none like you among the gods, O Lord,
nor are there any works like yours.


9 All the nations you have made shall come and bow down before you, O Lord,
and shall glorify your name.
10 For you are great and do wondrous deeds;
and you alone are God.
11 Teach me your way, O LORD, that I may walk in your truth;
train my heart to fear your name.
12 I will give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with all my heart,
and I will glorify your name forever.


13 For great is your steadfast love toward me;
you have delivered my soul from the depths of the grave.
14 O God, arrogant men have risen up against me,
a band of violent men seeks my life,
and they do not set you before them.
15 But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious,
slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.
16 Turn to me and be gracious to me;
give your strength to your servant,
and save the son of your maidservant.
17 Show me a sign for good,
so that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame,
because you, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.




Chapter 87


1 His foundation is on the holy mountains.
2 The LORD loves the gates of Zion
more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
3 Glorious things are spoken of you,
O city of God.
4 “I will mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know me;
even Philistia and Tyre, along with Cush will say ‘This one was born there.’”


5 And of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one were born in her,”
and the Most High himself will establish her.
6 The LORD will record, when he registers the peoples,
“This one was born there.”
7 Singers and flute players alike say,
“All my springs are in you.”




Chapter 88


1 O LORD, God of my salvation,
I cry out before you day and night.
2 Let my prayer come before you;
incline your ear to my cry.
3 For my soul is full of troubles,
and my life draws near to the grave.
4 I am counted among those who go down to the pit;
I am like a man without strength,
5 abandoned among the dead,
like the slain who lie in the grave,
whom you remember no more,
for they are cut off from your hand.


6 You have placed me in the lowest pit,
in dark places, in the depths.
7 Your wrath lies heavy upon me,
and you have afflicted me with all your waves. Selah
8 You have put my companions far from me;
you have made me an abomination to them.
I am shut in and cannot escape;
9 my eye grows dim with sorrow.
I call upon you, O LORD, every day;
I spread out my hands to you.


10 Will you work wonders for the dead?
Will the departed rise up to praise you? Selah
11 Is your loyal love declared in the grave,
your faithfulness in the place of destruction?
12 Are your wonders known in the darkness,
or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?


13 But I, O LORD, cry to you for help;
in the morning my prayer comes before you.
14 Why, O LORD, do you reject my life?
Why do you hide your face from me?
15 I am afflicted and close to death from my youth;
I suffer your terrors—I am in despair.
16 Your fierce wrath has swept over me;
your terrors have destroyed me.
17 They surround me like a flood all day long;
they close in on me altogether.
18 You have removed lover and friend far from me;
the darkness is my companion.




Chapter 89


1 I will sing of the steadfast love of the LORD forever;
with my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.
2 For I said, “Steadfast love will be built up forever;
in the heavens you will establish your faithfulness.”


3 “I have made a covenant with my chosen one;
I have sworn to David my servant:
4 ‘I will establish your offspring forever,
and build your throne for all generations.’” Selah


5 The heavens praise your wonders, O LORD,
your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
6 For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD?
Who is like the LORD among the sons of God,
7 a God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones,
and awesome above all who are around him?


8 O LORD God of hosts, who is mighty like you, O LORD?
Your faithfulness surrounds you.
9 You rule the raging of the sea;
when its waves rise, you still them.
10 You crushed Rahab like a corpse;
with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.


11 The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours;
the world and all that is in it, you founded them.
12 The north and the south, you created them;
Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name.
13 You have a mighty arm;
strong is your hand, exalted is your right hand.


14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne;
steadfast love and faithfulness go before your face.
15 Blessed are the people who know the festal shout,
who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face,
16 who rejoice in your name all day long,
and in your righteousness they are exalted.
17 For you are the glory of their strength,
and by your favor our horn is lifted up.
18 For our shield belongs to the LORD,
and our king to the Holy One of Israel.


19 Then you spoke in a vision to your faithful one and said:
“I have set a crown on one who is mighty;
I have exalted one chosen from the people.
20 I have found David my servant;
with my holy oil I have anointed him,
21 so that my hand shall be established with him;
my arm also shall strengthen him.


22 The enemy shall not outwit him;
the son of wickedness shall not humble him.
23 I will crush his foes before him
and strike down those who hate him.
24 My faithfulness and my steadfast love shall be with him,
and in my name his horn shall be exalted.
25 I will set his hand on the sea
and his right hand on the rivers.
26 He shall cry to me, ‘You are my Father,
my God, and the Rock of my salvation.’
27 And I will make him the firstborn,
the highest of the kings of the earth.


28 My steadfast love I will keep for him forever,
and my covenant shall stand firm for him.
29 I will establish his offspring forever
and his throne as the days of the heavens.


30 If his sons forsake my law
and do not walk according to my rules,
31 if they violate my statutes
and do not keep my commandments,
32 then I will punish their transgression with the rod
and their iniquity with stripes;


33 but I will not remove from him my steadfast love
or be false to my faithfulness.
34 I will not violate my covenant
or alter the word that went forth from my lips.


35 Once for all I have sworn by my holiness;
I will not lie to David.
36 His offspring shall endure forever,
his throne as long as the sun before me.
37 Like the moon it shall be established forever,
a faithful witness in the skies.” Selah


38 But you have cast off and rejected;
you are full of wrath against your anointed.
39 You have renounced the covenant with your servant;
you have defiled his crown in the dust.
40 You have broken down all his walls;
you have brought his strongholds to ruin.
41 All who pass by plunder him;
he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
42 You have exalted the right hand of his foes;
you have made all his enemies rejoice.
43 You have also turned back the edge of his sword,
and you have not made him stand in battle.


44 You have ended his splendor
and cast his throne to the ground.
45 You have shortened the days of his youth;
you have covered him with shame. Selah


46 How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever?
How long will your wrath burn like fire?
47 Remember how short my time is!
For what futility have you created all the sons of man?
48 What man can live and never see death?
Who can deliver his life from the power of the grave? Selah


49 Lord, where is your steadfast love of old,
which you swore to David in your faithfulness?
50 Remember, O Lord, the reproach of your servants—
how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the many nations,
51 with which your enemies mock, O LORD,
with which they mock the footsteps of your anointed.


52 Blessed be the LORD forever!
Amen and Amen.




Chapter 90


1 Lord, you have been our dwelling place
in all generations.


2 Before the mountains were born,
or you brought forth the earth and the world,
from everlasting to everlasting you are God.


3 You turn man back to dust
and say, “Return, sons of man.”
4 For a thousand years in your sight
are like yesterday when it passes,
or like a watch in the night.


5 You sweep them away like a flood; they are like a dream,
like grass that is renewed in the morning.
6 In the morning it flourishes and is renewed;
in the evening it fades and withers.


7 For we are consumed by your anger,
and by your wrath we are dismayed.
8 You have set our iniquities before you,
our secret sins in the light of your presence.


9 For all our days pass away under your wrath;
we bring our years to an end like a sigh.
10 The days of our years are seventy,
or if by strength, eighty;
yet their pride is but toil and trouble;
they are soon gone, and we fly away.


11 Who considers the power of your anger,
and your wrath according to the fear that is due you?


12 So teach us to number our days
that we may gain a heart of wisdom.


13 Return, O LORD! How long?
Have compassion on your servants.
14 Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love,
that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.


15 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,
for as many years as we have seen evil.
16 Let your work be shown to your servants,
and your majesty to their children.


17 Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us,
and establish the work of our hands upon us;
yes, establish the work of our hands.




Chapter 91


1 He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
2 I will say of the LORD, “My refuge and my fortress,
my God, in whom I trust.”


3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler
and from the deadly pestilence.
4 He will cover you with his feathers,
and under his wings you will take refuge;
His faithfulness is a shield and buckler.


5 You will not fear the terror of the night,
nor the arrow that flies by day,
6 nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness,
nor the destruction that lays waste at noonday.


7 A thousand may fall at your side,
and ten thousand at your right hand,
but it will not come near you.
8 You will only look with your eyes
and see the recompense of the wicked.


9 For you have made the LORD your refuge,
the Most High your dwelling place.
10 No evil shall befall you,
no plague shall draw near your tent.


11 For he will command his angels concerning you
to guard you in all your ways.
12 On their hands they will lift you up,
so you do not strike your foot against a stone.
13 You will tread upon the lion and the cobra;
the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.


14 “Because he has set his love upon me, I will deliver him;
I will set him on high, because he knows my name.
15 He will call upon me, and I will answer him;
I will be with him in trouble,
I will rescue him and honor him.
16 With long life I will satisfy him
and show him my salvation.”




Chapter 92


1 It is good to give thanks to the LORD,
and to sing praises to your name, O Most High,
2 to declare your steadfast love in the morning,
and your faithfulness by night,
3 with the ten-stringed lute and the harp,
with the melody of the lyre.


4 For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work;
at the deeds of your hands I sing for joy.
5 How great are your works, O LORD!
Your thoughts are very deep.


6 A brutish man does not know,
nor does a fool understand this:
7 though the wicked sprout like grass
and all evildoers flourish,
they will be destroyed forever.
8 But you, O LORD, are in heaven forever.


9 For I see your enemies, O LORD,
only look how your enemies will perish;
all evildoers will be scattered.


10 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox;
you have anointed me with fresh oil.
11 My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies;
my ears have heard of the doom of the evildoers who rise up against me.


12 The righteous will flourish like the palm tree
and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
13 Planted in the house of the LORD,
they will flourish in the courts of our God.
14 They will still bear fruit in old age;
they will be full of sap and fresh,
15 declaring that the LORD is upright;
He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.




Chapter 93


1 The LORD reigns; He is clothed with majesty;
the LORD is clothed; He has girded Himself with strength;
indeed, the world is established; it shall not be moved.
2 Your throne is established from of old;
You are from everlasting.
3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD,
the floods have lifted up their voice;
the floods lift up their pounding waves.
4 More than the voices of many waters,
more than the mighty breakers of the sea,
the LORD on high is mighty.
5 Your testimonies are very sure;
holiness befits Your house,
O LORD, forevermore.




Chapter 94


1 O LORD, God of vengeance,
God of vengeance, shine forth.
2 Rise up, O Judge of the earth;
repay the proud what they deserve.


3 How long shall the wicked, O LORD,
how long shall the wicked exult?
4 They pour out arrogant words;
all the evildoers boast of themselves.
5 They crush Your people, O LORD,
and afflict Your heritage.
6 They kill the widow and the sojourner,
and murder the fatherless.


7 And they say, “The LORD does not see;
the God of Jacob does not understand.”
8 Understand, you senseless among the people;
and you fools, when will you become wise?


9 He who planted the ear, does He not hear?
He who formed the eye, does He not see?
10 He who disciplines nations, will He not punish,
He who teaches man knowledge?
11 The LORD knows the thoughts of man,
that they are but a breath.


12 Blessed is the man whom You discipline, O LORD,
and teach out of Your law,
13 to give him rest from days of trouble,
until a pit is dug for the wicked.
14 For the LORD will not forsake His people;
He will not abandon His heritage.
15 For judgment will again be righteous,
and all the upright in heart will follow it.


16 Who will rise up for me against the wicked?
Who will stand for me against evildoers?
17 If the LORD had not been my help,
my soul would soon have dwelt in silence.
18 When I said, “My foot is slipping,”
Your steadfast love, O LORD, supported me.
19 When my anxious thoughts multiplied within me,
Your consolations delighted my soul.


20 Can a throne of destruction be allied with You,
one that frames mischief by statute?
21 They band together against the life of the righteous,
and condemn the innocent to death.
22 But the LORD has been my stronghold,
and my God the rock of my refuge.
23 And He will repay them for their iniquity,
and will destroy them for their evil;
the LORD our God will destroy them.




Chapter 95


1 Oh come, let us sing to the LORD;
let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
2 Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving;
let us make a joyful noise to Him with songs of praise.


3 For the LORD is a great God,
and a great King above all gods.
4 In His hand are the depths of the earth;
the heights of the mountains are His also.


5 The sea is His, for He made it,
and His hands formed the dry land.
6 Oh come, let us worship and bow down;
let us kneel before the LORD our Maker.


7 For He is our God,
and we are the people of His pasture
and the sheep of His hand.
Today, if you hear His voice,
8 do not harden your heart, as at Meribah,
as on the day at Massah in the wilderness,
9 when your fathers tested Me,
they tried Me, though they had seen My work.


10 For forty years I loathed that generation
and said, “They are a people who go astray in their heart,
and they have not known My ways.”
11 Therefore I swore in My wrath,
“They shall not enter My rest.”




Chapter 96


1 Sing to the LORD a new song;
sing to the LORD, all the earth.
2 Sing to the LORD, bless His name;
proclaim His salvation from day to day.
3 Declare His glory among the nations,
His marvelous works among all the peoples.


4 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised;
He is to be feared above all gods.
5 For all the gods of the nations are idols,
but the LORD made the heavens.
6 Splendor and majesty are before Him;
strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.


7 Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations,
ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
8 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name;
bring an offering, and come into His courts.
9 Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness;
tremble before Him, all the earth.


10 Say among the nations, “The LORD reigns!
Yes, the world is established; it shall not be moved;
He will judge the peoples with equity.”
11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;
let the sea roar, and all that fills it.
12 Let the field exult, and everything in it;
then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy
13 before the LORD, for He comes,
for He comes to judge the earth.
He will judge the world in righteousness,
and the peoples in His truth.




Chapter 97


1 The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice;
let the many coastlands be glad.
2 Clouds and thick darkness are around Him;
righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.
3 Fire goes before Him
and burns up His adversaries all around.
4 His lightnings light up the world;
the earth sees and trembles.


5 The mountains melt like wax before the LORD,
before the Lord of all the earth.
6 The heavens declare His righteousness,
and all the peoples see His glory.
7 All who serve carved images are put to shame,
those who boast in idols;
worship Him, all you gods.
8 Zion hears and is glad,
and the daughters of Judah rejoice,
because of Your judgments, O LORD.


9 For You, O LORD, are Most High over all the earth;
You are exalted far above all gods.
10 O you who love the LORD, hate evil!
He preserves the lives of His saints;
He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
11 Light is sown for the righteous,
and joy for the upright in heart.
12 Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous,
and give thanks to His holy name.




Chapter 98


1 Sing to the LORD a new song,
for He has done marvelous things;
His right hand and His holy arm
have worked salvation for Him.
2 The LORD has made known His salvation;
He has revealed His righteousness in the sight of the nations.
3 He has remembered His steadfast love and faithfulness
to the house of Israel.
All the ends of the earth have seen
the salvation of our God.


4 Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth;
break forth into joyful song and sing praises.
5 Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre,
with the lyre and the sound of melody.
6 With trumpets and the sound of the horn,
make a joyful noise before the King, the LORD.


7 Let the sea roar, and all that fills it,
the world and those who dwell in it.
8 Let the rivers clap their hands;
let the mountains sing together for joy
9 before the LORD, for He comes to judge the earth.
He will judge the world with righteousness,
and the peoples with equity.




Chapter 99


1 The LORD reigns; let the nations tremble.
He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake.
2 The LORD is great in Zion;
He is exalted over all the nations.


3 Let them praise Your great and awesome name.
Holy is He.
4 The strength of the King loves justice.
You have established equity;
You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.


5 Exalt the LORD our God;
worship at His footstool.
Holy is He.
6 Moses and Aaron were among His priests,
and Samuel also among those who called upon His name.
They called to the LORD, and He answered them.


7 In a pillar of cloud He spoke to them;
they kept His testimonies
and the statute that He gave them.
8 O LORD our God, You answered them;
a forgiving God were You to them,
but an avenger of their deeds.


9 Exalt the LORD our God,
and worship at His holy mountain;
for the LORD our God is holy.




Chapter 100


1 Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth.
2 Serve the LORD with gladness;
come before Him with joyful singing.
3 Know that the LORD, He is God.
It is He who made us, and not we ourselves;
we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.
4 Enter His gates with thanksgiving,
and His courts with praise.
Give thanks to Him, bless His name.
5 For the LORD is good;
His steadfast love endures forever,
and His faithfulness to all generations.




Chapter 101


1 I will sing of steadfast love and justice;
to You, O LORD, I will make music.
2 I will ponder the way that is blameless.
Oh, when will You come to me?
I will walk with integrity of heart within my house.
3 I will not set before my eyes
anything that is worthless.
I hate the work of those who fall away;
it shall not cling to me.
4 A perverse heart shall be far from me;
I will know nothing of evil.
5 Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret,
him I will put to silence;
whoever has haughty eyes and an arrogant heart,
him I will not endure.
6 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land,
that they may dwell with me;
he who walks in the way that is blameless,
he shall minister to me.
7 No one who practices deceit
shall dwell in my house;
no one who utters lies
shall continue before my eyes.
8 Morning by morning I will destroy
all the wicked of the land,
cutting off all evildoers
from the city of the LORD.




Chapter 102


1 Hear my prayer, O LORD,
and let my cry come to You.
2 Do not hide Your face from me
in the day of my distress.
Incline Your ear to me;
in the day when I call, answer me speedily.
3 For my days pass away like smoke,
and my bones burn like a furnace.


4 My heart is struck down like grass and withers;
I forget to eat my bread.
5 Because of my loud groaning
my bones cling to my flesh.


6 I am like a desert owl of the wilderness;
I am like an owl of the waste places.
7 I lie awake;
I am like a lonely bird on a housetop.


8 All day long my enemies taunt me;
those who deride me use my name for a curse.
9 For I eat ashes like bread
and mingle my drink with tears,
10 because of Your indignation and wrath;
for You have lifted me up and cast me down.


11 My days are like a lengthening shadow;
and I wither away like grass.
12 But You, O LORD, are enthroned forever;
Your name endures to all generations.


13 You will arise and have compassion on Zion;
for it is the time to show favor to her;
the appointed time has come.
14 For Your servants hold her stones dear
and have pity on her dust.


15 The nations will fear the name of the LORD,
and all the kings of the earth Your glory.
16 For the LORD builds up Zion;
He appears in His glory.
17 He regards the prayer of the destitute
and does not despise their prayer.


18 Let this be written for a generation to come,
so that a people yet to be created may praise the LORD,
19 that He looked down from His holy height,
from heaven the LORD looked at the earth,
20 to hear the groaning of the prisoner,
to set free those doomed to die,
21 that they may declare in Zion the name of the LORD,
and in Jerusalem His praise,
22 when peoples gather together,
and kingdoms, to serve the LORD.


23 He has broken my strength in midcourse;
He has shortened my days.
24 I say, “O my God,
do not take me away in the midst of my days—
Your years endure throughout all generations.”
25 Of old You laid the foundation of the earth,
and the heavens are the work of Your hands.
26 They will perish, but You remain;
they will all wear out like a garment.
You will change them like a robe,
and they will pass away.
27 But You are the same,
and Your years have no end.
28 The children of Your servants shall dwell secure;
their offspring shall be established before You.




Chapter 103


1 Bless the LORD, O my soul,
and all that is within me, bless His holy name.
2 Bless the LORD, O my soul,
and do not forget all His benefits,
3 who forgives all your iniquity,
who heals all your diseases,
4 who redeems your life from the pit,
who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,
5 who satisfies you with good
so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.


6 The LORD works righteousness
and justice for all who are oppressed.
7 He made known His ways to Moses,
His acts to the children of Israel.
8 The LORD is merciful and gracious,
slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
9 He will not always contend,
nor will He keep His anger forever.


10 He does not deal with us according to our sins,
nor repay us according to our iniquities.
11 For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
so great is His steadfast love toward those who fear Him.
12 As far as the east is from the west,
so far does He remove our transgressions from us.
13 As a father has compassion on his children,
so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him.


14 For He knows our frame;
He remembers that we are dust.
15 As for man, his days are like grass;
he flourishes like a flower of the field;
16 for the wind passes over it, and it is gone,
and its place knows it no more.


17 But the steadfast love of the LORD
is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear Him,
and His righteousness to their children’s children,
18 to those who keep His covenant
and remember to do His commandments.


19 The LORD has established His throne in the heavens,
and His kingdom rules over all.
20 Bless the LORD, you His angels,
mighty in strength, who do His word,
obeying the voice of His word.
21 Bless the LORD, all His hosts,
His ministers, who do His will.
22 Bless the LORD, all His works,
in all places of His dominion.
Bless the LORD, O my soul.




Chapter 104


1 Bless the LORD, O my soul.
O LORD my God, You are very great;
You are clothed with splendor and majesty,
2 covering Yourself with light as with a garment,
stretching out the heavens like a tent.


3 He lays the beams of His chambers on the waters;
He makes the clouds His chariot;
He rides on the wings of the wind.
4 He makes His messengers winds,
His ministers a flaming fire.


5 He set the earth on its foundations,
so that it should never be moved.
6 You covered it with the deep as with a garment;
the waters stood above the mountains.
7 At Your rebuke they fled;
at the sound of Your thunder they took to flight.
8 The mountains rose, the valleys sank down
to the place that You appointed for them.
9 You set a boundary that they may not pass,
so that they might not again cover the earth.


10 You make springs gush forth in the valleys;
they flow between the hills;
11 they give drink to every beast of the field;
the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
12 Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell;
they sing among the branches.


13 From Your lofty abode You water the mountains;
the earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your work.
14 You cause the grass to grow for the cattle,
and plants for man to cultivate,
that he may bring forth food from the earth,
15 and wine to gladden the heart of man,
oil to make his face shine,
and bread to strengthen man’s heart.


16 The trees of the LORD are well watered,
the cedars of Lebanon that He planted.
17 In them the birds build their nests;
the stork has her home in the fir trees.
18 The high mountains are for the wild goats;
the cliffs are a refuge for the rock badgers.


19 He made the moon to mark the seasons;
the sun knows its time for setting.
20 You make darkness, and it is night,
when all the beasts of the forest creep about.


21 The young lions roar for their prey,
seeking their food from God.
22 When the sun rises, they withdraw
and lie down in their dens.
23 Man goes out to his work
and to his labor until the evening.


24 O LORD, how manifold are Your works!
In wisdom You have made them all;
the earth is full of Your creatures.
25 Here is the sea, great and wide,
which teems with creatures innumerable,
living things both small and great.
26 There go the ships,
and Leviathan, which You formed to play in it.


27 These all look to You,
to give them their food in due season.
28 When You give it to them, they gather it up;
when You open Your hand, they are filled with good things.
29 When You hide Your face, they are dismayed;
when You take away their breath, they die
and return to their dust.
30 When You send forth Your Spirit, they are created,
and You renew the face of the ground.


31 May the glory of the LORD endure forever;
may the LORD rejoice in His works,
32 who looks on the earth and it trembles,
who touches the mountains and they smoke.


33 I will sing to the LORD as long as I live;
I will sing praise to my God while I have being.
34 May my meditation be pleasing to Him,
for I rejoice in the LORD.


35 Let sinners be consumed from the earth,
and let the wicked be no more.
Bless the LORD, O my soul.
Praise the LORD.




Chapter 105


1 Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name;
make known His deeds among the peoples.
2 Sing to Him, sing praises to Him;
tell of all His wondrous works.
3 Glory in His holy name;
let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
4 Seek the LORD and His strength;
seek His face continually.


5 Remember the wondrous works that He has done,
His miracles, and the judgments He uttered,
6 O offspring of Abraham His servant,
children of Jacob, His chosen ones.
7 He is the LORD our God;
His judgments are in all the earth.
8 He remembers His covenant forever,
the word that He commanded, for a thousand generations,
9 the covenant that He made with Abraham,
His sworn promise to Isaac,
10 which He confirmed to Jacob as a statute,
to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
11 saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,
as your portion for an inheritance.”


12 When they were few in number,
of little account, and sojourners in it,
13 wandering from nation to nation,
from one kingdom to another people,
14 He allowed no man to oppress them;
He rebuked kings on their account,
15 saying, “Do not touch My anointed ones,
do My prophets no harm.”


16 When He summoned a famine on the land
and broke all supply of bread,
17 He had sent a man ahead of them,
Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
18 His feet were hurt with fetters;
his neck was put in a collar of iron;
19 until what he had said came to pass,
the word of the LORD tested him.


20 The king sent and released him;
the ruler of the peoples set him free;
21 he made him lord of his house
and ruler of all his possessions,
22 to bind his princes at his pleasure
and to teach his elders wisdom.


23 Then Israel came to Egypt;
Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
24 And the LORD made His people very fruitful
and made them stronger than their foes.
25 He turned their hearts to hate His people,
to deal craftily with His servants.


26 He sent Moses His servant,
and Aaron, whom He had chosen.
27 They performed His signs among them,
and miracles in the land of Ham.
28 He sent darkness, and made the land dark;
and they did not rebel against His words.
29 He turned their waters into blood
and caused their fish to die.
30 Their land swarmed with frogs,
even in the chambers of their kings.
31 He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,
and gnats throughout their land.
32 He gave them hail for rain,
and fiery bolts in their land.
33 He struck down their vines and fig trees
and shattered the trees of their territory.
34 He spoke, and the locusts came,
young locusts without number,
35 which devoured all the vegetation in their land
and ate up the fruit of their ground.
36 He struck down all the firstborn in their land,
the firstfruits of all their strength.


37 Then He brought out Israel with silver and gold,
and there was none among His tribes who stumbled.
38 Egypt was glad when they departed,
for dread of them had fallen upon them.
39 He spread a cloud for a covering,
and fire to give light by night.
40 They asked, and He brought quail,
and He gave them bread from heaven in abundance.
41 He opened the rock, and water gushed out;
it flowed through the desert like a river.
42 For He remembered His holy promise,
and Abraham His servant.


43 So He brought His people out with joy,
His chosen ones with singing.
44 And He gave them the lands of the nations,
and they inherited the fruit of the peoples’ labor,
45 that they might keep His statutes
and observe His laws.
Praise the LORD.




Chapter 106


1 Praise the LORD.
Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good,
for His steadfast love endures forever.


2 Who can utter the mighty deeds of the LORD,
or declare all His praise?


3 Blessed are those who observe justice,
who do righteousness at all times.


4 Remember me, O LORD, when You show favor to Your people;
help me when You save them,
5 that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones,
that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation,
that I may glory with Your inheritance.


6 We have sinned, both we and our fathers;
we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
7 Our fathers, when they were in Egypt,
did not consider Your wondrous works;
they did not remember the abundance of Your steadfast love,
but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.
8 Yet He saved them for His name’s sake,
that He might make known His mighty power.


9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry,
and He led them through the deep as through a desert.
10 So He saved them from the hand of the foe
and redeemed them from the power of the enemy.
11 And the waters covered their adversaries;
not one of them was left.
12 Then they believed His words;
they sang His praise.


13 But they soon forgot His works;
they did not wait for His counsel.
14 They had a wanton craving in the wilderness,
and put God to the test in the desert.
15 He gave them what they asked,
but sent a wasting disease among them.


16 When men in the camp were jealous of Moses
and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD,
17 the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
and covered the company of Abiram.
18 Fire also broke out in their company;
the flame burned up the wicked.


19 They made a calf in Horeb
and worshiped a metal image.
20 They exchanged the glory of God
for the image of an ox that eats grass.
21 They forgot God, their Savior,
who had done great things in Egypt,
22 wondrous works in the land of Ham,
and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
23 Therefore He said He would destroy them—
had not Moses, His chosen one,
stood in the breach before Him,
to turn away His wrath from destroying them.


24 Then they despised the pleasant land,
having no faith in His promise.
25 They murmured in their tents,
and did not obey the voice of the LORD.
26 Therefore He lifted His hand
and swore to them
that He would make them fall in the wilderness,
27 and would make their offspring fall among the nations,
scattering them among the lands.


28 Then they yoked themselves to Baal of Peor,
and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;
29 they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds,
and a plague broke out among them.
30 Then Phinehas stood up and intervened,
and the plague was stayed.
31 And that was counted to him as righteousness
from generation to generation forever.


32 They angered Him at the waters of Meribah,
and it went ill with Moses on their account,
33 for they made his spirit bitter,
and he spoke rashly with his lips.
34 They did not destroy the peoples,
as the LORD commanded them,
35 but they mixed with the nations
and learned to do as they did.
36 They served their idols,
which became a snare to them.
37 They sacrificed their sons
and their daughters to the demons;
38 they poured out innocent blood,
the blood of their sons and daughters,
whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,
and the land was polluted with blood.
39 Thus they became unclean by their acts,
and played the whore in their deeds.
40 Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against His people,
and He abhorred His inheritance.


41 He gave them into the hand of the nations,
so that those who hated them ruled over them.
42 Their enemies oppressed them,
and they were brought into subjection under their power.
43 Many times He delivered them,
but they were rebellious in their purposes
and were brought low through their iniquity.
44 Nevertheless, He looked upon their distress,
when He heard their cry.


45 For their sake He remembered His covenant,
and relented according to the abundance of His steadfast love.
46 He caused them to be pitied
by all those who held them captive.
47 Save us, O LORD our God,
and gather us from among the nations,
that we may give thanks to Your holy name
and glory in Your praise.
48 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
from everlasting to everlasting.
And let all the people say, “Amen!”
Praise the LORD.




Chapter 107


1 Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good,
for His steadfast love endures forever.
2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so,
whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,
3 and gathered in from the lands,
from the east and from the west,
from the north and from the sea.
4 They wandered in the wilderness, in a desert way;
they found no city to dwell in.
5 Hungry and thirsty,
their soul fainted within them.
6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
and He delivered them from their distresses.
7 He led them by a straight way,
till they reached a city to dwell in.
8 Let them thank the LORD for His steadfast love,
for His wondrous works to the sons of man.
9 For He satisfies the longing soul,
and the hungry soul He fills with good things.


10 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
prisoners in affliction and in irons,
11 for they had rebelled against the words of God,
and spurned the counsel of the Most High.
12 So He humbled their heart with labor;
they stumbled, and there was none to help.
13 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
and He delivered them from their distresses.
14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
and broke their bonds apart.
15 Let them thank the LORD for His steadfast love,
for His wondrous works to the sons of man.
16 For He shatters the doors of bronze
and cuts in two the bars of iron.


17 Fools, through their sinful ways,
and because of their iniquities, were afflicted.
18 Their soul loathed any kind of food,
and they drew near to the gates of death.
19 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
and He delivered them from their distresses.
20 He sent out His word and healed them,
and delivered them from their destruction.
21 Let them thank the LORD for His steadfast love,
for His wondrous works to the sons of man.
22 And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving,
and tell of His deeds with songs of joy.


23 Those who went down to the sea in ships,
doing business on the mighty waters,
24 they saw the deeds of the LORD,
His wondrous works in the deep.
25 For He spoke and raised the stormy wind,
which lifted up the waves of the sea.
26 They mounted up to heaven; they went down to the depths;
their courage melted away in their calamity.
27 They reeled and staggered like drunken men,
and were at their wits’ end.
28 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
and He delivered them from their distresses.
29 He made the storm be still,
and the waves of the sea were hushed.
30 Then they were glad that the waters were quiet,
and He brought them to their desired haven.
31 Let them thank the LORD for His steadfast love,
for His wondrous works to the sons of man.
32 Let them extol Him in the congregation of the people,
and praise Him in the assembly of the elders.


33 He turns rivers into a desert,
springs of water into thirsty ground,
34 a fruitful land into a salty waste,
because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.
35 He turns a desert into pools of water,
a parched land into springs of water.
36 And there He makes the hungry dwell,
and they establish a city to dwell in.
37 They sow fields and plant vineyards,
and get a fruitful yield.
38 By His blessing they multiply greatly,
and He does not let their cattle diminish.
39 When they are diminished and brought low
through oppression, evil, and sorrow,
40 He pours contempt on princes
and makes them wander in trackless wastes;
41 but He raises up the needy out of affliction
and makes their families like flocks.
42 The upright see it and are glad,
and all wickedness shuts its mouth.
43 Whoever is wise, let him attend to these things;
let them consider the steadfast love of the LORD.




Chapter 108


1 My heart is steadfast, O God;
I will sing, I will make melody with all my being.
2 Awake, harp and lyre!
I will awaken the dawn.


3 I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the nations;
I will sing praises to You among the peoples.
4 For great above the heavens is Your steadfast love;
Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.


5 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,
and let Your glory be over all the earth.
6 That Your beloved ones may be delivered,
give salvation by Your right hand and answer me.


7 God has spoken in His holiness:
“I will exult, I will divide up Shechem
and portion out the Valley of Succoth.
8 Gilead is Mine; Manasseh is Mine;
Ephraim is the helmet of My head;
Judah is My scepter.
9 Moab is My washbasin;
upon Edom I cast My shoe;
over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
10 Who will bring me to the fortified city?
Who will lead me to Edom?


11 Have You not rejected us, O God?
You do not go forth, O God, with our armies.
12 Give us help against the foe,
for vain is the salvation of man.
13 With God we shall do valiantly;
it is He who will tread down our foes.




Chapter 109


1 O God of my praise, do not be silent.
2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful
have opened against me;
they have spoken to me with a lying tongue.
3 They encircle me with words of hatred,
and attack me without cause.


4 In return for my love they accuse me,
but I am all prayer.
5 So they repay me evil for good,
and hatred for my love.


6 Appoint a wicked man over him,
and let an accuser stand at his right hand.
7 When he is judged, let him come out guilty;
and let his prayer become sin.
8 Let his days be few;
let another take his office.
9 Let his children be fatherless,
and his wife a widow.
10 Let his children wander about and beg,
let them seek sustenance far from their ruined homes.


11 Let the creditor seize all that he has;
let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.
12 Let there be none to extend kindness to him,
nor any to be gracious to his fatherless children.
13 Let his posterity be cut off;
in the generation to come let their name be blotted out.
14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD,
and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.


15 Let them be before the LORD continually,
that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
16 Because he did not remember to show kindness,
but pursued the afflicted and poor man,
and the brokenhearted, to put him to death.


17 He loved cursing, and it came upon him;
he did not delight in blessing, and it was far from him.
18 He clothed himself with cursing as his garment,
and it came into his body like water,
and like oil into his bones.


19 Let it be to him as the garment he wraps around him,
and as a belt he always wears.
20 Let this be the LORD’s repayment to my accusers,
and to those who speak evil against my life.


21 But You, O LORD my Lord,
act on my behalf for Your name’s sake;
because Your steadfast love is good, deliver me.
22 For I am afflicted and needy,
and my heart is wounded within me.


23 I fade away like a shadow at evening;
I am shaken off like a locust.
24 My knees are weak from fasting,
and my flesh grows lean with no fat.


25 I have become a reproach to them;
when they see me, they shake their heads.
26 Help me, O LORD my God;
save me according to Your steadfast love,
27 that they may know that this is Your hand;
that You, O LORD, have done it.
28 Let them curse, but You bless;
when they rise up, let them be put to shame,
but Your servant will rejoice.
29 Let my accusers be clothed with dishonor;
let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a cloak.


30 With my mouth I will give great thanks to the LORD;
I will praise Him in the midst of the multitude.
31 For He stands at the right hand of the needy,
to save him from those who condemn his soul to death.




Chapter 110


1 The LORD says to my lord:
“Sit at My right hand,
until I make your enemies your footstool.”
2 The LORD will stretch forth the scepter of Your strength from Zion,
saying, “Rule in the midst of Your enemies.”


3 Your people will offer themselves freely on the day of Your power,
in holy garments;
from the womb of the dawn,
the dew of Your youth is Yours.
4 The LORD has sworn
and will not change His mind,
“You are a priest forever
after the order of Melchizedek.”


5 The Lord is at Your right hand;
He will shatter kings on the day of His wrath.
6 He will judge among the nations, filling them with corpses;
He will shatter the head over the wide earth.
7 He will drink from the brook by the way;
therefore He will lift up His head.




Chapter 111


1 Praise the LORD.
I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart,
in the council of the upright, and in the congregation.


2 Great are the works of the LORD,
studied by all who delight in them.
3 Splendid and majestic is His work,
and His righteousness endures forever.


4 He has caused His wonders to be remembered;
the LORD is gracious and merciful.
5 He provides food for those who fear Him;
He remembers His covenant forever.


6 He has shown His people the power of His works,
in giving them the inheritance of the nations.
7 The works of His hands are faithful and just;
all His precepts are trustworthy.
8 They are established forever and ever,
to be performed with faithfulness and uprightness.


9 He sent redemption to His people;
He has commanded His covenant forever.
Holy and awesome is His name.
10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom;
all who practice them have good understanding.
His praise endures forever.




Chapter 112


1 Praise the LORD!
Blessed is the man who fears the LORD,
who greatly delights in His commandments.
2 His offspring will be mighty in the land;
the generation of the upright will be blessed.
3 Wealth and riches are in his house,
and his righteousness endures forever.
4 Light rises in the darkness for the upright;
He is gracious, compassionate, and righteous.
5 It is well with the man who deals generously and lends;
who conducts his affairs with justice.
6 For the righteous will never be shaken;
he will be remembered forever.
7 He is not afraid of bad news;
his heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.
8 His heart is secure; he will not be afraid,
until he looks in triumph on his adversaries.
9 He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor;
his righteousness endures forever;
his horn will be exalted in honor.
10 The wicked man sees it and is angry;
he gnashes his teeth and melts away;
the desire of the wicked will perish.




Chapter 113


1 Praise the LORD!
Praise, O servants of the LORD,
praise the name of the LORD!
2 Blessed be the name of the LORD
from this time forth and forevermore!
3 From the rising of the sun to its setting,
the name of the LORD is to be praised!


4 The LORD is high above all nations,
and His glory above the heavens.
5 Who is like the LORD our God,
who is seated on high,
6 who looks far down
on the heavens and the earth?


7 He raises the poor from the dust
and lifts the needy from the ash heap,
8 to make them sit with princes,
with the princes of His people.
9 He gives the barren woman a home,
making her the joyous mother of children.
Praise the LORD!




Chapter 114


1 When Israel went out from Egypt,
the house of Jacob from a people of strange speech,
2 Judah became His sanctuary,
Israel His dominion.


3 The sea saw and fled;
the Jordan turned back.
4 The mountains skipped like rams,
the hills like lambs.


5 What ails you, O sea, that you flee?
O Jordan, that you turn back?
6 O mountains, that you skip like rams?
O hills, like lambs?


7 Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord,
at the presence of the God of Jacob,
8 who turns the rock into a pool of water,
the flint into a spring of water.




Chapter 115


1 Not to us, O LORD, not to us,
but to Your name give glory,
because of Your steadfast love,
because of Your faithfulness.


2 Why should the nations say,
“Where now is their God?”
3 Our God is in the heavens;
He does whatever He pleases.
4 Their idols are silver and gold,
the work of human hands.
5 They have mouths, but do not speak;
eyes, but do not see.
6 They have ears, but do not hear;
noses, but do not smell.
7 They have hands, but do not feel;
feet, but do not walk;
they make no sound in their throat.
8 Those who make them will become like them,
everyone who trusts in them.


9 O Israel, trust in the LORD;
He is their help and their shield.
10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD;
He is their help and their shield.
11 You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD;
He is their help and their shield.


12 The LORD has remembered us; He will bless us;
He will bless the house of Israel;
He will bless the house of Aaron.
13 He will bless those who fear the LORD,
the small together with the great.


14 May the LORD give you increase,
you and your children.
15 May you be blessed by the LORD,
the Maker of heaven and earth.


16 The heavens are the heavens of the LORD,
but the earth He has given to the sons of man.
17 The dead do not praise the LORD,
nor do any who go down into silence.
18 But we will bless the LORD
from this time forth and forever.
Hallelujah.




Chapter 116


1 I love the LORD, for He has heard my voice
and my pleas for mercy.
2 Because He has inclined His ear to me,
I will call on Him as long as I live.


3 The cords of death encompassed me,
and the terrors of the grave found me;
I found distress and sorrow.
4 Then I called on the name of the LORD:
“O LORD, I pray, deliver my life!”


5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous;
our God is compassionate.
6 The LORD preserves the simple;
I was brought low, and He saved me.
7 Return, my soul, to your rest,
for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.


8 For You have delivered my life from death,
my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.
9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.


10 I believed, even when I said,
“I am greatly afflicted.”
11 I said in my alarm,
“All men are liars.”


12 What shall I render to the LORD
for all His benefits toward me?
13 I will lift up the cup of salvation
and call on the name of the LORD.
14 I will pay my vows to the LORD
in the presence of all His people.


15 Precious in the sight of the LORD
is the death of His faithful ones.
16 O LORD, I am indeed Your servant;
I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant;
You have loosed my bonds.
17 I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving
and call on the name of the LORD.
18 I will pay my vows to the LORD
in the presence of all His people,
19 in the courts of the house of the LORD,
in your midst, O Jerusalem.
Hallelujah.




Chapter 117


1 Praise the LORD, all nations; extol Him, all peoples.
2 For His steadfast love prevails over us,
and the faithfulness of the LORD endures forever.
Hallelujah.




Chapter 118


1 Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good;
for His steadfast love endures forever.


2 Let Israel say,
“His steadfast love endures forever.”
3 Let the house of Aaron say,
“His steadfast love endures forever.”
4 Let those who fear the LORD say,
“His steadfast love endures forever.”


5 Out of distress I called upon the LORD;
the LORD answered me and set me in a spacious place.
6 The LORD is with me;
I will not fear. What can man do to me?
7 The LORD is with me, as my helper;
therefore I will look in triumph on those who hate me.


8 It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man.
9 It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes.


10 All nations surrounded me;
in the name of the LORD I cut them off.
11 They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me;
in the name of the LORD I cut them off.
12 They surrounded me like bees;
they were extinguished like a fire of thorns;
in the name of the LORD I cut them off.
13 You pushed me hard to make me fall,
but the LORD helped me.


14 The LORD is my strength and my song;
He has become my salvation.
15 A sound of joyful shouting and salvation is in the tents of the righteous;
the right hand of the LORD does valiantly.
16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted;
the right hand of the LORD does valiantly.
17 I shall not die, but live,
and declare the works of the LORD.
18 The LORD has disciplined me severely,
but He has not given me over to death.


19 Open to me the gates of righteousness;
I will enter through them, I will give thanks to the LORD.
20 This is the gate of the LORD;
the righteous shall enter through it.
21 I give You thanks, for You have answered me
and have become my salvation.


22 The stone the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone.
23 This is the LORD’s doing;
it is marvelous in our eyes.
24 This is the day the LORD has made;
let us rejoice and be glad in it.


25 O LORD, save now, I pray;
O LORD, grant success, I pray.
26 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD;
we bless you from the house of the LORD.
27 The LORD is God, and He has given us light;
bind the festal sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar.


28 You are my God, and I will give You thanks;
You are my God, I will exalt You.


29 Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good;
for His steadfast love endures forever.




Chapter 119


1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way,
who walk in the law of the LORD.
2 Blessed are those who keep His testimonies,
who seek Him with all their heart.
3 They also do no iniquity;
they walk in His ways.
4 You have commanded Your precepts,
that they be kept diligently.
5 Oh, that my ways were established
to keep Your statutes!
6 Then I would not be ashamed
when I regard all Your commandments.
7 I will give You thanks with an upright heart
when I learn Your righteous judgments.
8 I will keep Your statutes;
do not utterly forsake me.


9 How can a young man keep his way pure?
By guarding it according to Your word.
10 With all my heart I have sought You;
let me not stray from Your commandments.
11 I have treasured Your word in my heart,
that I might not sin against You.
12 Blessed are You, O LORD;
teach me Your statutes.
13 With my lips I have declared
all the judgments of Your mouth.
14 I rejoice in the way of Your testimonies
as much as in all riches.
15 I will meditate on Your precepts
and regard Your ways.
16 I will delight in Your statutes;
I will not forget Your word.


17 Deal bountifully with Your servant,
that I may live and keep Your word.
18 Open my eyes, that I may behold
wondrous things from Your law.
19 I am a sojourner on the earth;
do not hide Your commandments from me.
20 My soul is consumed with longing
for Your judgments at all times.
21 You rebuke the proud, the cursed,
who wander from Your commandments.
22 Remove from me scorn and contempt,
for I have kept Your testimonies.
23 Even though princes sit and speak against me,
Your servant meditates on Your statutes.
24 Your testimonies are my delight,
they are my counselors.


25 My soul clings to the dust;
revive me according to Your word.
26 I have declared my ways, and You answered me;
teach me Your statutes.
27 Make me understand the way of Your precepts,
that I may meditate on Your wondrous works.
28 My soul weeps because of grief;
strengthen me according to Your word.
29 Remove from me the way of falsehood,
and graciously grant me Your law.
30 I have chosen the way of faithfulness;
I have set Your judgments before me.
31 I cling to Your testimonies, O LORD;
do not let me be put to shame.
32 I will run in the way of Your commandments,
for You enlarge my heart.


33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of Your statutes,
and I will keep it to the end.
34 Give me understanding, that I may keep Your law
and observe it with my whole heart.
35 Make me walk in the path of Your commandments,
for in it I delight.
36 Incline my heart to Your testimonies,
and not to dishonest gain.
37 Turn my eyes away from worthless things,
and revive me in Your ways.
38 Establish Your word to Your servant,
which leads to the fear of You.
39 Turn away my reproach which I dread,
for Your judgments are good.
40 Behold, I long for Your precepts;
revive me in Your righteousness.
41 Let Your steadfast love come to me, O LORD, Your salvation according to Your word.
42 So I will have an answer for him who reproaches me, for I trust in Your word.
43 Do not take the word of truth utterly from my mouth, for I wait for Your judgments.
44 So I will keep Your law continually, forever and ever.
45 And I will walk in liberty, for I seek Your precepts.
46 I will speak of Your testimonies before kings and will not be ashamed.
47 I will delight in Your commandments, which I love.
48 I will lift up my hands to Your commandments, which I love, and I will meditate on Your statutes.


49 Remember the word to Your servant, in which You have made me hope.
50 This is my comfort in my affliction, that Your word has revived me.
51 The arrogant utterly deride me, but I do not turn aside from Your law.
52 I remember Your judgments of old, O LORD, and I take comfort.
53 Rage seizes me because of the wicked, who forsake Your law.
54 Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my sojourning.
55 I remember Your name in the night, O LORD, and keep Your law.
56 This has been mine, that I have kept Your precepts.


57 The LORD is my portion; I have promised to keep Your words.
58 I entreat Your favor with all my heart; be gracious to me according to Your word.
59 I have considered my ways and turned my feet to Your testimonies.
60 I hasten and do not delay to keep Your commandments.
61 The cords of the wicked surround me, but I have not forgotten Your law.
62 At midnight I rise to give thanks to You because of Your righteous judgments.
63 I am a companion of all who fear You and of those who keep Your precepts.
64 The earth is full of Your steadfast love, O LORD; teach me Your statutes.


65 You have dealt well with Your servant, O LORD, according to Your word.
66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in Your commandments.
67 Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep Your word.
68 You are good and do good; teach me Your statutes.
69 The arrogant smear me with lies, but I keep Your precepts with all my heart.
70 Their heart is unfeeling like fat, but I delight in Your law.
71 It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn Your statutes.
72 The law of Your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.


73 Your hands made me and fashioned me; give me understanding that I may learn Your commandments.
74 Those who fear You shall see me and rejoice, because I hope in Your word.
75 I know, O LORD, that Your judgments are righteous, and that in faithfulness You have afflicted me.
76 Let Your steadfast love now comfort me, according to Your promise to Your servant.
77 Let Your compassion come to me, that I may live, for Your law is my delight.
78 Let the arrogant be ashamed, for they have wronged me with falsehood; I will meditate on Your precepts.
79 Let those who fear You turn to me, and those who know Your testimonies.
80 Let my heart be blameless in Your statutes, that I may not be put to shame.


81 My soul longs for Your salvation; I hope in Your word.
82 My eyes fail for Your promise, saying, “When will You comfort me?”
83 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, yet I do not forget Your statutes.
84 How many are the days of Your servant? When will You execute judgment on those who persecute me?
85 The proud have dug pits for me, those who do not live according to Your law.
86 All Your commandments are faithful; they persecute me with falsehood—help me!
87 They almost consumed me on the earth, but I have not forsaken Your precepts.
88 Revive me according to Your steadfast love, that I may keep the testimony of Your mouth.


89 Forever, O LORD, Your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.
90 Your faithfulness endures to all generations; You established the earth, and it stands.
91 They stand this day according to Your ordinances, for all things are Your servants.
92 If Your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.
93 I will never forget Your precepts, for by them You have given me life.
94 I am Yours; save me, for I have sought Your precepts.
95 The wicked lie in wait to destroy me, but I consider Your testimonies.
96 I have seen a limit to all perfection, but Your commandment is exceedingly broad.


97 Oh, how I love Your law! It is my meditation all the day.
98 Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for they are ever with me.
99 I have more insight than all my teachers, for Your testimonies are my meditation.
100 I understand more than the aged, because I keep Your precepts.
101 I have restrained my feet from every evil way, that I may keep Your word.
102 I have not turned aside from Your judgments, for You Yourself have taught me.
103 How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
104 Through Your precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way.


105 Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.
106 I have sworn and confirmed to keep Your righteous judgments.
107 I am afflicted very much; revive me, O LORD, according to Your word.
108 Accept, O LORD, the freewill offerings of my mouth, and teach me Your judgments.
109 My life is continually in my hand, yet I do not forget Your law.
110 The wicked have set a snare for me, yet I have not strayed from Your precepts.
111 Your testimonies are my heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart.
112 I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes forever, to the end.


113 I hate the double-minded, but I love Your law.
114 You are my hiding place and my shield; I hope in Your word.
115 Depart from me, evildoers, that I may keep the commandments of my God.
116 Uphold me according to Your word, that I may live, and do not let me be ashamed of my hope.
117 Hold me up, that I may be safe and have regard for Your statutes continually.
118 You reject all who stray from Your statutes, for their deceit is falsehood.
119 You remove all the wicked of the earth like dross; therefore I love Your testimonies.
120 My flesh trembles for fear of You, and I am afraid of Your judgments.


121 I have done what is just and right; do not leave me to my oppressors.
122 Guarantee the welfare of Your servant; let not the proud oppress me.
123 My eyes fail for Your salvation and for the fulfillment of Your righteous promise.
124 Deal with Your servant according to Your steadfast love, and teach me Your statutes.
125 I am Your servant; give me understanding, that I may know Your testimonies.
126 It is time for the LORD to act, for they have broken Your law.
127 Therefore I love Your commandments above gold, yes, above fine gold.
128 Therefore I regard all Your precepts as right in every way; I hate every false path.


129 Your testimonies are wonderful; therefore my soul keeps them.
130 The unfolding of Your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.
131 I open my mouth and pant, because I long for Your commandments.
132 Turn to me and be gracious to me, as is Your way with those who love Your name.
133 Establish my steps by Your word, and let no iniquity have dominion over me.
134 Redeem me from the oppression of man, that I may keep Your precepts.
135 Make Your face shine upon Your servant, and teach me Your statutes.
136 Streams of tears flow from my eyes, because men do not keep Your law.


137 Righteous are You, O LORD, and upright are Your judgments.
138 You have commanded Your testimonies in righteousness and great faithfulness.
139 My zeal consumes me, because my foes forget Your words.
140 Your word is very pure, and Your servant loves it.
141 I am small and despised, yet I do not forget Your precepts.
142 Your righteousness is everlasting, and Your law is truth.
143 Trouble and distress have come upon me, yet Your commandments are my delight.
144 The righteousness of Your testimonies is everlasting; give me understanding, that I may live.


145 I call with my whole heart; answer me, O LORD. I will keep Your statutes.
146 I call to You; save me, that I may observe Your testimonies.
147 I rise before dawn and cry for help; I hope in Your word.
148 My eyes are awake before the watches of the night, that I may meditate on Your promise.
149 Hear my voice according to Your steadfast love; O LORD, revive me according to Your justice.
150 Those who pursue wickedness draw near; they are far from Your law.
151 You are near, O LORD, and all Your commandments are truth.
152 Long have I known from Your testimonies that You have established them forever.


153 Look upon my affliction and deliver me, for I do not forget Your law.
154 Plead my cause and redeem me; revive me according to Your promise.
155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek Your statutes.
156 Great are Your mercies, O LORD; revive me according to Your ordinances.
157 Many are my persecutors and my foes, yet I do not turn from Your testimonies.
158 I look upon the faithless with loathing, because they do not keep Your word.
159 Consider how I love Your precepts; revive me, O LORD, according to Your steadfast love.
160 The sum of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous ordinances endures forever.


161 Princes persecute me without cause, but my heart stands in awe of Your word.
162 I rejoice at Your word as one who finds great spoil.
163 I hate and abhor falsehood, but I love Your law.
164 Seven times a day I praise You because of Your righteous judgments.
165 Great peace have those who love Your law, and nothing causes them to stumble.
166 I hope for Your salvation, O LORD, and I do Your commandments.
167 My soul keeps Your testimonies, and I love them exceedingly.
168 I keep Your precepts and Your testimonies, for all my ways are before You.


169 Let my cry come near before You, O LORD; give me understanding according to Your word.
170 Let my supplication come before You; deliver me according to Your promise.
171 My lips will pour forth praise, for You teach me Your statutes.
172 My tongue will sing of Your word, for all Your commandments are righteous.
173 Let Your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen Your precepts.
174 I long for Your salvation, O LORD, and Your law is my delight.
175 Let my soul live and praise You, and let Your ordinances help me.
176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Your servant, for I do not forget Your commandments.




Chapter 120


1 In my distress I called to the LORD,
 and He answered me.
2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips,
 from a deceitful tongue.
3 What shall be given to you,
 and what more shall be done to you, deceitful tongue?
4 Sharp arrows of the warrior,
 with burning coals of the broom tree.


5 Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech,
 that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
6 Too long has my soul had its dwelling
 with those who hate peace.
7 I am for peace,
 but when I speak, they are for war.




Chapter 121


1 I lift up my eyes to the mountains—
 from where will my help come?
2 My help comes from the LORD,
 the Maker of heaven and earth.


3 He will not allow your foot to slip;
 your Keeper will not slumber.
4 Behold, He who keeps Israel
 will neither slumber nor sleep.


5 The LORD is your Keeper;
 the LORD is your shade at your right hand.
6 The sun will not strike you by day,
 nor the moon by night.


7 The LORD will keep you from all evil;
 He will keep your soul.
8 The LORD will keep your going out and your coming in
 from this time forth and forever.


***
Chapter 122


1 I rejoiced when they said to me,
 “Let us go to the house of the LORD.”
2 Our feet have been standing
 within your gates, O Jerusalem.


3 Jerusalem, built as a city
 that is joined together as one,
4 to which the tribes go up,
 the tribes of the LORD,
 as a statute for Israel
 to give thanks to the name of the LORD.
5 For there thrones for judgment were set,
 the thrones of the house of David.


6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
 “May those who love you be secure.
7 May there be peace within your walls,
 prosperity within your palaces.”
8 For the sake of my brothers and my companions,
 I will now say, “Peace be within you.”
9 For the sake of the house of the LORD our God,
 I will seek your good.




Chapter 123


1 To you I lift up my eyes,
 you who are enthroned in the heavens.
2 As the eyes of a servant look to the hand of his master,
 as the eyes of a maidservant to the hand of her mistress,
 so our eyes look to the LORD our God,
 until he shows us favor.


3 Show us favor, O LORD, show us favor,
 for we have had our fill of contempt.
4 Our soul has had its fill
 of the mockery of the self-assured,
 of the contempt of the proud.




Chapter 124


1 “If the LORD had not been for us,”
 let Israel now say,
2 “If the LORD had not been for us
 when men rose up against us,
3 then they would have swallowed us alive,
 when their anger burned against us;
4 then the waters would have swept us away,
 a torrent would have passed over us;
5 then over us would have passed
 the raging waters.”


6 Blessed be the LORD,
 who has not given us as prey to their teeth.
7 Our soul has escaped like a bird
 out of the snare of the fowlers;
 the snare is broken, and we have escaped.


8 Our help is in the name of the LORD,
 the Maker of heaven and earth.




Chapter 125


1 Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion,
 which cannot be moved but abides forever.
2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
 so the LORD surrounds his people now and forever.
3 The scepter of the wicked shall not rest
 over the allotted portion of the righteous;
 lest the righteous extend their hands to iniquity.
4 Do good, O LORD, to those who are good,
 to the upright in heart.
5 But as for those who turn aside to crooked ways,
 the LORD will lead them away with evildoers.
 Peace be upon Israel.




Chapter 126


1 When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion,
 we were like men who dream.
2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
 and our tongue with shouts of joy;
 then they said among the nations,
 “The LORD has done great things for them.”
3 The LORD has done great things for us;
 we rejoiced.


4 Restore our fortunes, O LORD,
 like streams in the Negev.
5 Those who sow with tears
 shall reap with shouts of joy.
6 He goes along weeping,
 carrying the bag of seed;
 he shall surely come with shouts of joy,
 carrying his sheaves.




Chapter 127


1 Unless the LORD builds the house,
 its builders labor in vain;
 unless the LORD watches over the city,
 the watchman stays awake in vain.
2 It is in vain that you rise early,
 that you sit up late,
 eating the bread of toil;
 for he gives sleep to his beloved.
3 Sons are an inheritance from the LORD,
 the fruit of the womb a reward.
4 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,
 so are the sons of one’s youth.
5 Blessed is the man whose quiver is filled with them;
 he shall not be put to shame
 when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.




Chapter 128


1 Blessed is every man who fears the LORD,
 who walks in his ways.
2 You shall eat the labor of your hands;
 you shall be blessed, and it shall be well with you.
3 Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine
 within your house;
 your sons like olive shoots
 around your table.
4 Yes, in this way shall the man be blessed
 who fears the LORD.
5 May the LORD bless you from Zion,
 that you may see the good of Jerusalem
 all the days of your life;
6 and that you may see your sons’ sons.
 Peace upon Israel.




Chapter 129


1 “Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth”—
 let Israel now say—
2 “Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth,
 yet they have not prevailed against me.
3 The plowmen plowed upon my back;
 they made their furrows long.”
4 The LORD is righteous;
 he has cut the cords of the wicked.
5 Let all who hate Zion
 be put to shame and turned backward.
6 Let them be like grass on the housetops,
 which withers before it is pulled up,
7 with which the reaper does not fill his hand,
 nor the binder of sheaves his arms;
8 and none who pass by say,
 “The blessing of the LORD be upon you;
 we bless you in the name of the LORD.”




Chapter 130


1  From the depths I call to you, O LORD;
  2  Lord, hear my voice;
    let your ears be attentive
    to my plea for mercy.


3  If you should mark iniquities, Lord,
  Lord, who could stand?
4  But with you there is forgiveness,
  so that you may be feared.


5  I wait for the LORD—my soul waits—
  and in his word I hope;
6  my soul waits for the Lord
  more than watchmen for the morning,
  more than watchmen for the morning.


7  O Israel, wait for the LORD,
  for with the LORD is steadfast love,
  and with him is abundant redemption.
8  And he will redeem Israel
  from all his iniquities.




Chapter 131


1 LORD, my heart is not proud,
 nor are my eyes lifted high,
 nor have I walked in great matters
 or in things too wondrous for me.
2 Surely I have composed and quieted my soul,
 like a weaned child with his mother;
 like a weaned child upon me is my soul.


3 Let Israel wait for the LORD
 from now until forever.




Chapter 132


1 LORD, remember for David
 all his hardship—
2 how he swore to the LORD,
 vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
3 “I will not enter the tent of my house;
 I will not go up upon the couch of my bed;
4 I will not give sleep to my eyes,
 slumber to my eyelids,
5 until I find a place for the LORD,
 a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”


6 Look, we heard of it in Ephrathah;
 we found it in the fields of the forest.
7 Let us go into his dwelling-place;
 let us bow down at his footstool.


8 Rise, LORD, to your resting-place,
 you and the ark of your strength.
9 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness,
 and let your faithful ones shout for joy.
10 For the sake of David your servant,
 do not turn away the face of your anointed.


11 The LORD swore to David in truth—
 he will not turn from it—
 “From the fruit of your body I will set one upon your throne.
12 If your sons keep my covenant
 and my testimonies that I teach them,
 their sons also will sit upon your throne forever.”


13 For the LORD has chosen Zion;
 he has desired it for his dwelling:
14 “This is my resting-place forever;
 here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
15 I will bless its provisions abundantly;
 I will satisfy its needy with bread.
16 I will clothe its priests with salvation,
 and its faithful ones will shout loudly for joy.
17 There I will cause a horn for David to spring up;
 I have set in place a lamp for my anointed.
18 His enemies I will clothe with shame,
 but upon him his crown will shine.”




Chapter 133


1 How good and how pleasant it is
 for brothers to dwell together in unity.
2 It is like the precious oil on the head,
 running down upon the beard,
 running down upon Aaron’s beard,
 running down over the collar of his robes.
3 It is like the dew of Hermon
 coming down upon the mountains of Zion,
 for there the LORD commanded the blessing —
 life forever.


Chapter 134


1 Come! Praise the LORD, all you servants of the LORD,
 who stand by night in the house of the LORD.
2 Lift up your hands in holiness
 and bless the LORD.
3 May the LORD bless you from Zion,
 the Maker of heaven and earth.




Chapter 135


1 Praise the LORD. Praise the name of the LORD;
 praise Him, you servants of the LORD,
2 you who stand in the house of the LORD,
 in the courts of the house of our God.
3 Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good;
 sing to His name, for it is pleasant.
4 For the LORD has chosen Jacob for Himself,
 Israel as His treasured possession.
5 I know that the LORD is great,
 and our Lord is above all gods.
6 Whatever the LORD desires He does,
 in heaven and on earth,
 in the seas and all the depths.
7 He brings up clouds from the ends of the earth;
 He makes lightning for the rain;
 He brings the wind out of His storehouses.
8 He struck the firstborn of Egypt,
 both of man and of beast.
9 He sent signs and wonders into your midst, Egypt,
 against Pharaoh and all his servants.
10 He struck down many nations
 and killed mighty kings,
11 Sihon king of the Amorites,
 and Og king of Bashan,
 and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
12 He gave their land as a heritage,
 a heritage to Israel His people.
13 Your name, LORD, endures forever;
 Your remembrance, LORD, through all generations.
14 For the LORD will judge His people
 and will have compassion on His servants.
15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
 the work of human hands.
16 They have mouths but do not speak;
 they have eyes but do not see;
17 they have ears but do not hear,
 nor is there breath in their mouths.
18 Those who make them become like them,
 all who trust in them.
19 House of Israel, bless the LORD;
 house of Aaron, bless the LORD;
20 house of Levi, bless the LORD;
 you who fear the LORD, bless the LORD.
21 Bless the LORD from Zion,
 He who dwells in Jerusalem.
 Praise the LORD.

 for His loyal love endures forever.

 for His loyal love endures forever.
21 And gave their land as a heritage,
 for His loyal love endures forever.
22 A heritage to Israel His servant,
 for His loyal love endures forever.
23 Who remembered us in our low estate,
 for His loyal love endures forever.
24 And rescued us from our adversaries,
 for His loyal love endures forever.
25 Who gives food to all flesh,
 for His loyal love endures forever.
26 Give thanks to the God of heaven,
 for His loyal love endures forever.




Chapter 137


1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down,
 we also wept when we remembered Zion.
2 On the willows in its midst
 we hung up our lyres.
3 For there our captors demanded songs of us,
 and our tormentors asked for joy, saying,
 “Sing for us one of the songs of Zion.”
4 How can we sing the song of the LORD
 on foreign soil?
5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
 may my right hand forget its skill.
6 May my tongue cling to my palate
 if I do not remember you,
 if I do not set Jerusalem
 above my highest joy.
7 Remember, LORD, against the sons of Edom
 the day of Jerusalem,
 when they said, “Tear it down,
 tear it down to its foundations!”
8 Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,
 blessed is he who repays you
 for what you have done to us.
9 Blessed is he who seizes your little ones
 and dashes them against the rock.


Chapter 138


1 I will give you thanks with all my heart;
 before the gods I will sing your praise.
2 I will bow toward your holy temple
 and give thanks to your name for your loyal love and your faithfulness,
 for you have exalted your word above every name.
3 On the day I called, you answered me;
 you made me bold with strength in my soul.
4 All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, LORD,
 for they have heard the words of your mouth.
5 And they will sing of the ways of the LORD,
 for great is the glory of the LORD.
6 For though the LORD is exalted,
 he sees the lowly,
 but the lofty he knows from afar.
7 Though I walk in the midst of distress, you preserve my life;
 you stretch out your hand against the anger of my enemies,
 and your right hand saves me.
8 The LORD will complete what concerns me;
 your loyal love, LORD, is everlasting—
 do not abandon the work of your hands.




Chapter 139


1 LORD, you have searched me and known me.
2 You know my sitting down and my rising up;
 you discern my thoughts from afar.
3 You measure out my path and my lying down,
 and you are acquainted with all my ways.
4 For there is not a word on my tongue,
 but you, LORD, know it completely.
5 You hem me in behind and before,
 and you lay your hand upon me.
6 Such knowledge is too extraordinary for me;
 it is too high—I cannot reach it.


7 Where can I go from your Spirit?
 Or where can I flee from your presence?
8 If I ascend to the heavens, you are there;
 if I make my bed in the grave, you are there.
9 If I lift up the wings of the dawn,
 if I dwell at the farthest end of the sea,
10 even there your hand will lead me,
 and your right hand will take hold of me.
11 And if I say, “Surely darkness will cover me,”
 then the night becomes light around me.
12 Even darkness is not dark to you,
 and the night shines like the day;
 darkness and light are alike to you.


13 For you formed my inward parts;
 you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
14 I will give you thanks, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
 your works are wonderful—my soul knows this very well.
15 My frame was not hidden from you
 when I was made in secret,
 woven in the depths of the earth.
16 Your eyes saw my unformed substance,
 and in your book all of them were written—
 the days that were fashioned for me,
 when none of them yet existed.
17 How precious to me are your thoughts, O God;
 how vast is their sum!
18 If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand;
 when I awake, I am still with you.


19 O that you would slay the wicked, O God—
 and men of blood, depart from me!
20 They speak of you with evil intent;
 your adversaries take your name in vain.
21 Do I not hate those who hate you, LORD?
 And do I not loathe those who rise up against you?
22 I hate them with complete hatred;
 I count them as my enemies.


23 Search me, O God, and know my heart;
 test me and know my anxious thoughts.
24 And see if any harmful way is in me,
 and lead me in the everlasting way.


Chapter 140


1 Deliver me, O LORD, from an evil man; preserve me from a violent man.
2 Who think up evil in their heart all day; war is in their hearts when they dwell.
3 Their tongue is sharp as a serpent’s; the venom of a viper lies under their lips. Selah
4 Keep me, LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from violent men who have purposed to make my feet slip.
5 The arrogant have set a trap for me; with ropes they spread a net by the path; they have hidden snares for me. Selah
6 I said to the LORD, “You are my God; listen to the voice of my supplication, LORD.”
7 O LORD God, the strength of my salvation, you cover my head in the day of battle.
8 Do not grant, LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not let their evil plan succeed, or they will be exalted. Selah
9 Let the mischief of their lips cover those who surround me.
10 Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be thrown into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
11 A slanderer shall not be established in the land; the violent and wicked man shall be hunted with thrust upon thrust.
12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the needy.
13 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name; the upright will dwell in your presence.


Chapter 141


1 LORD, I call to you—hurry to me;
give ear to my voice when I call to you.
2 Let my prayer be set before you like incense,
the lifting up of my hands like the evening offering.
3 Set a guard, LORD, over my mouth;
keep watch at the door of my lips.
4 Do not let my heart incline to an evil thing,
to practice wicked deeds with wicked men;
and let me not eat of their delicacies.
5 Let a righteous man strike me—it is kindness;
let him rebuke me—it is oil on my head; let my head not refuse it.
Yet my prayer is still against their evil deeds.
6 When their judges are thrown down beside rocky cliffs,
they will hear my words, for they are pleasant.
7 As when one plows and breaks up the earth,
so our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave.
8 But my eyes are toward you, O LORD, my Lord;
in you I seek refuge—do not leave my soul exposed.
9 Keep me from the trap they have set for me,
from the snares of workers of wickedness.
10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets together, while I pass by safely.


Chapter 142


1 With my voice I cry out to the LORD;
with my voice I plead for mercy from the LORD.
2 I pour out my complaint before him;
I lay out my distress before him.
3 When my spirit grows faint within me,
you yourself know my path.
In the way where I walk
they have hidden a trap for me.
4 Look to my right and see—
there is no one who acknowledges me;
refuge has vanished from me;
no one seeks my soul.


5 I cry to you, LORD;
I say, “You are my refuge,
my portion in the land of the living.”
6 Listen to my cry,
for I am brought very low;
rescue me from those who pursue me,
for they are too strong for me.
7 Bring my soul out of the prison,
that I may give thanks to your name;
the righteous will gather around me,
for you will deal generously with me.




Chapter 143


1 Hear my prayer, O LORD; give ear to my cry for mercy;
  in your faithfulness answer me, in your righteousness.
2 Do not enter into judgment with your servant,
  for no man living is righteous before you.
3 For the enemy has pursued my soul;
  he has crushed my life to the ground;
  he has made me dwell in darkness
    like those long dead.
4 And my spirit grows faint within me;
  within me my heart is desolate.
5 I remember the days of old;
  I meditate on all your works;
  I ponder the work of your hands.
6 I stretch out my hands to you;
  my soul thirsts for you like a parched land.
7 Answer me quickly, O LORD;
  my spirit fails.
Do not hide your face from me,
  lest I become like those descending to the grave.
8 Let me hear your steadfast love in the morning,
  for in you I trust.
Make known to me the way I should walk,
  for to you I lift up my soul.
9 Deliver me from my enemies, O LORD;
  I flee to you for refuge.
10 Teach me to do your will,
  for you are my God.
Let your good Spirit lead me
  on level ground.
11 For your name’s sake, O LORD, let me live;
  in your righteousness bring my soul out of distress.
12 And in your steadfast love cut off my enemies
  and destroy all who afflict my soul,
  for I am your servant.


Chapter 144


1 Blessed be the LORD, my rock,
  who trains my hands for war,
  my fingers for battle;
2 my steadfast love and my fortress,
  my stronghold and my deliverer,
  my shield, in whom I take refuge,
  who subdues my foes beneath me.


3 O LORD, what is man that you regard him,
  or the son of man that you take account of him?
4 Man is like a breath;
  his days are like a passing shadow.


5 O LORD, bend your heavens and come down;
  touch the mountains that they may smoke.
6 Flash forth lightning and scatter them;
  shoot your arrows and rout them.
7 Stretch out your hands from on high;
  rescue me and deliver me
  from great waters,
  from the hand of foreigners,
8 whose mouth speaks falsehood,
  and whose right hand is a right hand of deceit.


9 I will sing a new song to you, O God;
  on a harp of ten strings I will make melody to you,
10 who gives salvation to kings,
  who rescues David his servant
  from the deadly sword.
11 Rescue me and deliver me
  from the hand of foreigners,
  whose mouth speaks falsehood
  and whose right hand is a right hand of deceit.


12 May our sons be like plants grown up in their youth,
  our daughters like corner pillars
  crafted for the structure of a palace;
13 may our storehouses be full,
  yielding all kinds of produce;
may our flocks increase by thousands,
  by tens of thousands in our fields;
14 may our cattle be heavy with young;
  may there be no breach, no going out,
  and no cry of distress in our streets.
15 Blessed are the people to whom such things belong;
  blessed are the people whose God is the LORD.




Chapter 145


1 I will exalt you, my God, the King,
  and I will bless your name forever and ever.
2 Every day I will bless you,
  and I will praise your name forever and ever.
3 Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised,
  and his greatness is unsearchable.
4 One generation will praise your works to the next,
  and will declare your mighty acts.
5 On the glorious splendor of your majesty
  and on your wondrous works I will meditate.
6 And they will speak of the might of your awesome deeds,
  and I will recount your greatness.
7 They will pour forth the memory of your abundant goodness,
  and will sing aloud of your righteousness.
8 The LORD is gracious and compassionate,
  slow to anger and great in steadfast love.
9 The LORD is good to all,
  and his compassion is over all his works.
10 All your works will give thanks to you, O LORD,
  and your saints will bless you.
11 They will speak of the glory of your kingdom,
  and will talk of your might,
12 to make known to the sons of man his mighty deeds,
  and the glorious splendor of his kingdom.
13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
  and your dominion endures through all generations.
The LORD is faithful in all his words,
  and kind in all his works.
14 The LORD upholds all who fall,
  and raises up all who are bowed down.
15 The eyes of all look to you,
  and you give them their food in its season.
16 You open your hand
  and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways,
  and kind in all his works.
18 The LORD is near to all who call on him,
  to all who call on him in truth.
19 He fulfills the desire of those who fear him;
  he hears their cry and saves them.
20 The LORD guards all who love him,
  but all the wicked he will destroy.
21 My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD,
  and all flesh will bless his holy name
  forever and ever.




Chapter 146


1 Praise the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
2 I will praise the LORD while I live;
  I will sing praises to my God while I exist.
3 Do not trust in princes,
  in a son of man in whom there is no salvation.
4 His spirit departs, he returns to the ground;
  on that very day his plans vanish.
5 Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob,
  whose hope is in the LORD his God,
6 who made heaven and earth,
  the sea and all that is in them;
  who keeps faith forever;
7 who executes justice for the oppressed,
  who gives bread to the hungry.
The LORD sets prisoners free;
8 the LORD opens the eyes of the blind;
  the LORD raises up those who are bowed down;
  the LORD loves the righteous.
9 The LORD guards the sojourners;
  he upholds the fatherless and the widow,
  but he overthrows the way of the wicked.
10 The LORD will reign forever—
  your God, O Zion, to all generations.
Praise the LORD.




Chapter 147


1 Praise the LORD, for it is good to sing praises to our God;
  for it is pleasant, and praise is fitting.
2 The LORD builds Jerusalem;
  he gathers the outcasts of Israel.
3 He heals the brokenhearted
  and binds up their wounds.
4 He counts the number of the stars;
  he gives names to all of them.
5 Great is our Lord and abundant in power;
  his understanding is without measure.
6 The LORD lifts up the afflicted;
  he casts the wicked down to the ground.


7 Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving;
  make melody to our God with the lyre.
8 He covers the sky with clouds;
  he prepares rain for the earth;
  he makes grass grow on the mountains.
9 He gives food to the beasts,
  and to the young ravens when they cry.
10 He does not delight in the strength of the horse;
  he takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
11 The LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him,
  in those who hope in his steadfast love.


12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem;
  praise your God, O Zion.
13 For he strengthens the bars of your gates;
  he blesses your sons within you.
14 He makes peace in your borders;
  he satisfies you with the finest of wheat.
15 He sends out his command to the earth;
  his word runs swiftly.
16 He gives snow like wool;
  he scatters frost like ashes.
17 He casts forth his ice like crumbs;
  who can stand before his cold?
18 He sends out his word and melts them;
  he makes his wind blow, and the waters flow.
19 He declares his word to Jacob,
  his statutes and his judgments to Israel.
20 He has not dealt thus with any nation;
  and as for his judgments, they do not know them.
Praise the LORD.




Chapter 148


1 Praise the LORD. Praise the LORD from the heavens;
  praise him in the heights.
2 Praise him, all his angels;
  praise him, all his hosts.
3 Praise him, sun and moon;
  praise him, all stars of light.
4 Praise him, you highest heavens,
  and you waters above the heavens.
5 Let them praise the name of the LORD,
  for he commanded and they were created.
6 And he established them forever and ever;
  he gave a decree, and it will not pass away.
7 Praise the LORD from the earth,
  you sea monsters and all deeps;
8 fire and hail, snow and mist,
  stormy wind executing his word;
9 mountains and all hills,
  fruit trees and all cedars;
10 beasts and all cattle,
  creeping things and winged birds;
11 kings of the earth and all nations,
  princes and all judges of the earth;
12 young men and also young women,
  old men and youths;
13 let them praise the name of the LORD,
  for his name alone is exalted;
  his majesty is above earth and heaven.
14 And he has raised up a horn for his people,
  a praise for all his saints,
  for the sons of Israel, a people near to him.
Praise the LORD.




Chapter 149


1 Praise the LORD. Sing to the LORD a new song,
  his praise in the assembly of the faithful.
2 Let Israel rejoice in his Maker;
  let the sons of Zion be glad in their King.
3 Let them praise his name with dancing;
  let them make melody to him with tambourine and lyre.
4 For the LORD takes pleasure in his people;
  he adorns the afflicted with salvation.
5 Let the faithful exult in glory;
  let them sing aloud on their beds.
6 Let the high praises of God be in their throats,
  and a two-edged sword in their hands,
7 to execute vengeance on the nations,
  and punishments on the peoples,
8 to bind their kings with chains,
  and their nobles with shackles of iron,
9 to execute on them the written judgment—
  this is honor for all his faithful ones.
Praise the LORD.




Chapter 150


1 Praise the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary;
  praise him in his mighty expanse.
2 Praise him for his mighty deeds;
  praise him according to his abundant greatness.
3 Praise him with the blast of the horn;
  praise him with harp and lyre.
4 Praise him with tambourine and dancing;
  praise him with strings and flute.
5 Praise him with sounding cymbals;
  praise him with cymbals of loud acclaim.
6 Let everything that has breath praise the LORD.
Praise the LORD.﻿Proverbs


Chapter 1


1 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:


2 To know wisdom and instruction, to discern the sayings of understanding,  
3 to receive instruction in wise behavior, righteousness, justice, and integrity,  
4 to give prudence to the naïve, knowledge and discretion to the youth—  
5 let the wise man hear and increase in learning, and let the man of understanding acquire guidance—  
6 to understand a proverb and a figure, the words of the wise and their riddles.


7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.


8 Hear, my son, your father’s instruction, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching,  
9 for they are a garland of grace on your head and necklaces about your neck.


10 My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.  
11 If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without cause;  
12 let us swallow them alive like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;  
13 we will find all sorts of precious possessions, we will fill our houses with spoil;  
14 cast your lot among us; let us all have one purse”—  
15 my son, do not walk in the way with them; restrain your foot from their path,  
16 for their feet run to evil, and they hasten to shed blood.


17 Surely, in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird,  
18 but they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives.  
19 Such are the ways of everyone who gains by violence; it takes away the life of its possessors.


20 Wisdom cries out in the street; she lifts her voice in the public square.  
21 At the head of the noisy streets she calls out; at the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her sayings:  
22 “How long, O naïve ones, will you love simplicity? And how long will scoffers delight in their scoffing, and fools hate knowledge?  
23 Turn at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.


24 Because I called and you refused, I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention,  
25 and you neglected all my counsel and did not want my reproof,  
26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your dread comes,  
27 when your dread comes like a storm, and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.


28 Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but will not find me.  
29 Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,  
30 they would not accept my counsel; they spurned all my reproof—  
31 so they shall eat the fruit of their way and be filled with their own devices.  
32 For the waywardness of the naïve will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.  
33 But he who listens to me will dwell securely and will be at ease, without dread of evil.




Chapter 2


1 My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments within you,
2 making your ear attentive to wisdom, inclining your heart to understanding,
3 yes, if you call out for discernment, raise your voice for understanding.


4 If you seek her like silver and search for her as for hidden treasures,
5 then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.


6 For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding;
7 He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk in integrity,
8 guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of His saints.


9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity—every good path;
10 for wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
11 discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you.


12 It will deliver you from the way of evil, from men who speak perverse things,
13 who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,
14 who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perversity of the wicked,
15 whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways;


16 Stay away from the strange woman, from the foreign woman with her smooth words,
17 who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;
18 for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed.
19 None who go to her return, nor do they attain the paths of life.


20 So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.
21 For the upright will dwell in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;
22 but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be uprooted from it.




Chapter 3


1 My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,
2 for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.


3 Do not let kindness and truth forsake you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart,
4 so you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.


5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.
6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.
7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.
8 It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.


9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce,
10 then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.


11 My son, do not despise the discipline of the LORD, and do not loathe His reproof,
12 for the LORD loves those whom He reproves, as a father the son in whom he delights.


13 Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding,
14 for her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her yield than fine gold.
15 She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.
16 Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.
17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
18 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.


19 The LORD founded the earth by wisdom; He established the heavens by understanding.
20 By His knowledge the deeps were split, and the clouds produce dew.


21 My son, do not let them escape from your sight; keep sound wisdom and discretion,
22 and they will be life to your soul and adornment to your neck.
23 Then you will walk securely on your way, and your foot will not stumble.
24 If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
25 Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the storm of the wicked when it comes,
26 for the LORD will be your confidence and will guard your foot from being caught.


27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
28 Do not say to your neighbor, “Go and come again; tomorrow I will give it”—when you have it with you.
29 Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you.
30 Do not contend with a man for no reason, if he has done you no harm.
31 Do not envy a violent man, and do not choose any of his ways,
32 for the devious man is an abomination to the LORD, but His secret counsel is with the upright.


33 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked, but He blesses the dwelling of the righteous.
34 He mocks the mockers, but gives grace to the humble.
35 The wise will inherit honor, but fools display dishonor.




Chapter 4


1 Hear, O sons, the instruction of a father, and pay attention, that you may gain understanding,
2 for I give you good teaching; do not forsake my instruction.


3 When I was a son to my father, tender and the only one in the sight of my mother,
4 he taught me and said to me, “Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments and live.
5 Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.
6 Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.


7 The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and with all your ability, get understanding.
8 Prize her, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.
9 She will place on your head a garland of grace; she will bestow on you a crown of beauty.”


10 Hear, my son, and receive my words, and the years of your life will be many.
11 I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in paths of uprightness.
12 When you walk, your step will not be hindered, and if you run, you will not stumble.
13 Hold fast to instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.


14 Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of evil men.
15 Avoid it; do not pass by it; turn away from it and pass on.
16 For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble.
17 For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.


18 The road the righteous travel is like the light of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until full day.
19 The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what they stumble over.


20 My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.
21 Do not let them depart from your eyes; keep them in the midst of your heart.
22 For they are life to those who find them and healing to all their flesh.


23 Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life.
24 Put away from yourself crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you.
25 Let your eyes look directly ahead, and let your gaze be straight before you.
26 Make the path of your foot level, and all your ways will be established.
27 Do not turn to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.




Chapter 5


1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding,
2 that you may guard discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.


3 For the lips of the strange woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,
4 but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword.
5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lay hold of the grave.
6 She does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.


7 Now then, my sons, listen to me, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.
8 Keep your path far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,
9 lest you give your vigor to others and your years to the cruel one;
10 lest strangers be filled with your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner,
11 and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and your body are consumed,
12 and you say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!
13 I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.
14 I was almost in utter ruin in the midst of the assembly and congregation.”


15 Drink water from your own cistern, and running water from your own well.
16 Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?
17 Let them be yours alone and not for strangers with you.
18 Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,
19 a loving doe, a graceful gazelle—let her breasts satisfy you at all times; be intoxicated always in her love.
20 Why, my son, should you be intoxicated with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?


21 For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the LORD, and He watches all his paths.
22 The iniquities of the wicked will ensnare him, and he will be held fast in the cords of his sin.
23 He will die for lack of discipline, and in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.




Chapter 6


1 My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger,
2 if you are snared by the words of your mouth, caught by the words of your mouth,
3 then do this, my son, and deliver yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor:
Go, humble yourself, and urge your neighbor;
4 give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.


5 Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
6 Go to the ant, O sluggard; observe her ways and be wise,
7 who, having no chief, officer, or ruler,
8 prepares her food in the summer and gathers her provision in the harvest.
9 How long will you lie down, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?
10 “A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,”
11 and your poverty will come like a prowler, and your want like an armed man.


12 A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,
13 winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, signaling with his fingers;
14 perversity is in his heart; he continually devises evil; he spreads strife.
15 Therefore his calamity will come suddenly; in a moment he will be broken without remedy.


16 There are six things that the LORD hates, even seven that are an abomination to Him:
17 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
18 a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run swiftly to evil,
19 a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who spreads strife among brothers.


20 My son, keep your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
21 Bind them continually on your heart; tie them around your neck.
22 When you walk, it will lead you; when you lie down, it will watch over you; and when you awake, it will speak with you.
23 For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,
24 to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the foreign woman.


25 Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelids.
26 For on account of a prostitute one is reduced to a loaf of bread, and a man’s wife hunts down a precious life.
27 Can a man carry fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
28 Or can a man walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?
29 So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; whoever touches her will not go unpunished.


30 People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry;
31 but if he is found, he must repay sevenfold; he must give all the substance of his house.
32 He who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.
33 Wounds and dishonor he will get, and his reproach will not be wiped away.
34 For jealousy enrages a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance;
35 he will not accept any ransom, nor will he be appeased though you multiply gifts.




Chapter 7


1 My son, hold fast to my words and store up my commands within you.
2 Keep my commands so that you may live, and treasure my teaching like the gem of your eye.
3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.
4 Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your close companion,
5 to guard you from the adulterous woman, from the seductive stranger with her smooth words.


6 For I looked out through the lattice of my window,
7 and I saw among the naive—I noticed among the young men—a youth lacking sense.
8 He was passing along the street near her corner, walking toward her house,
9 in the twilight, as evening fell, in the dark of night and shadows.
10 Then a woman came toward him, dressed like a prostitute, with a cunning heart.
11 She was loud and defiant; her feet never stayed at home.
12 Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurked at every corner.
13 She grabbed him and kissed him; with a brazen face, she said to him,
14 “I had to offer peace offerings; today I fulfilled my vows.
15 That’s why I came out to meet you, to seek you eagerly—and I’ve found you!
16 I’ve spread my bed with coverings, with colored linens from Egypt.
17 I’ve perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
18 Come, let’s drink deeply of love until morning; let’s delight ourselves with passion.
19 For my husband isn’t home; he’s gone on a long journey.
20 He took a bag of money with him; he won’t return until the full moon.”


21 With her many persuasions, she seduced him; with her smooth talk, she led him astray.
22 He followed her at once, like an ox going to the slaughter, or like a stag caught in a trap,
23 until an arrow pierces its liver—like a bird rushing into a snare, unaware that it will cost him his life.


24 Now, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to the words of my mouth.
25 Don’t let your heart turn aside to her ways; don’t stray into her paths.
26 For she has brought down many victims; her slain are a vast throng.
27 Her house is the road to the grave, descending to the chambers of death.




Chapter 8


1 Does not Wisdom call out, and Understanding raise her voice?  
2 On the heights, beside the road, at the crossroads she takes her stand.  
3 Beside the gates, at the entrance to the city, at the access points she cries aloud:  
4 “To you, O men, I call out, and my voice is to the sons of man.  
5 Understand shrewdness, O simple ones; and you fools, have an understanding heart.  
6 Listen, for I will speak noble things, and the opening of my lips will reveal uprightness.  
7 For my mouth will utter truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  
8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; none of them are twisted or crooked.  
9 They are all clear to the discerning and right to those who find knowledge.  
10 Receive my instruction and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.  
11 For Wisdom is better than jewels, and all desirable things cannot compare with her.


12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.  
13 The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverse speech I hate.  
14 Counsel and sound wisdom are mine; I am understanding, I have might.  
15 By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just.  
16 By me princes govern, and nobles—all who judge rightly.  
17 I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me.  
18 Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness.  
19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield better than choice silver.  
20 I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice,  
21 to give wealth to those who love me and to fill their treasuries.


22 The Lord created me at the beginning of His way, before His deeds of old.  
23 From everlasting I was established, from the beginning, from before the earth began.  
24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no springs abounding with water.  
25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth—  
26 before He made the earth and its fields, or the first dust of the world.  
27 When He established the heavens, I was there; when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep;  
28 when He made firm the skies above; when the fountains of the deep surged forth;  
29 when He set limits for the sea so the waters would not transgress His command; when He marked out the foundations of the earth—  
30 then I was beside Him, like a master craftsman, and I was His delight day by day, rejoicing always before Him,  
31 rejoicing in the inhabited world, and delighting in the sons of man.


32 So now, sons, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways.  
33 Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it.  
34 Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.  
35 For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord.  
36 But he who sins against me injures his own soul; all who hate me love death.




Chapter 9


1 Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out her seven pillars.  
2 She has slaughtered her beasts, she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.  
3 She has sent out her maidens; she calls from the heights of the city,  
4 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” To him who lacks sense she says,  
5 “Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed.  
6 Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight.”


7 He who corrects a scoffer gets abuse for himself, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.  
8 Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you.  
9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will become still wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.


10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.  
11 For by me your days will be multiplied, and years of life will be added to you.  
12 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; but if you scoff, you alone will bear it.


13 The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive and knows nothing.  
14 She sits at the door of her house, she takes a seat on the high places of the city,  
15 calling to those who pass by, who go straight on their way,  
16 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” And to him who lacks sense she says,  
17 “Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.”  
18 But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of the grave.




Chapter 10


1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son makes a glad father,  
but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother.
2 Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit,  
but righteousness delivers from death.
3 The LORD does not let the righteous go hungry,  
but He thwarts the craving of the wicked.
4 A slack hand causes poverty,  
but the hand of the diligent makes rich.
5 He who gathers in summer is a prudent son,  
but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who brings shame.
6 Blessings are on the head of the righteous,  
but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing,  
but the name of the wicked will rot.
8 The wise of heart will receive commandments,  
but a babbling fool will come to ruin.
9 Whoever walks in integrity walks securely,  
but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.
10 Whoever winks the eye causes trouble,  
and a babbling fool will come to ruin.
11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,  
but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
12 Hatred stirs up strife,  
but love covers all offenses.
13 On the lips of him who has understanding, wisdom is found,  
but a rod is for the back of him who lacks sense.
14 The wise lay up knowledge,  
but the mouth of a fool brings ruin near.
15 The rich man’s wealth is his strong city;  
the poverty of the poor is their ruin.
16 The wage of the righteous leads to life,  
the gain of the wicked to sin.
17 Whoever heeds instruction is on the path to life,  
but he who rejects reproof leads others astray.
18 The one who conceals hatred has lying lips,  
and whoever utters slander is a fool.
19 When words are many, transgression is not lacking,  
but whoever restrains his lips is prudent.
20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver;  
the heart of the wicked is of little worth.
21 The lips of the righteous feed many,  
but fools die for lack of sense.
22 The blessing of the LORD makes rich,  
and He adds no sorrow with it.
23 Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool,  
but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding.
24 What the wicked dreads will come upon him,  
but the desire of the righteous will be granted.
25 When the tempest passes, the wicked is no more,  
but the righteous is established forever.
26 Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,  
so is the sluggard to those who send him.
27 The fear of the LORD prolongs life,  
but the years of the wicked will be short.
28 The hope of the righteous ends in gladness,  
but the expectation of the wicked comes to nothing.
29 The way of the LORD is a stronghold to the upright,  
but destruction to evildoers.
30 The righteous will never be removed,  
but the wicked will not dwell in the land.
31 The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom,  
but the perverse tongue will be cut off.
32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable,  
but the mouth of the wicked, what is perverse.




Chapter 11


1 A false balance is an abomination to the LORD,
 but a just weight is His delight.
2 When pride comes, then comes disgrace,
 but with the humble is wisdom.
3 The integrity of the upright guides them,
 but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them.


4 Riches do not profit in the day of wrath,
 but righteousness delivers from death.
5 The righteousness of the blameless makes his way straight,
 but the wicked falls by his own wickedness.
6 The righteousness of the upright delivers them,
 but the treacherous are taken captive by their lust.


7 When the wicked dies, his hope perishes,
 and the expectation of strength perishes too.
8 The righteous is delivered from trouble,
 and the wicked takes his place.
9 With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor,
 but by knowledge the righteous are delivered.


10 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices,
 and when the wicked perish, there is jubilation.
11 By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,
 but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
12 Whoever belittles his neighbor lacks sense,
 but a man of understanding remains silent.


13 He who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets,
 but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a matter hidden.
14 Where there is no guidance, a people falls,
 but in an abundance of counselors there is deliverance.
15 Whoever is surety for a stranger will surely suffer harm,
 but he who hates striking hands in pledge is secure.


16 A gracious woman obtains honor,
 and violent men obtain riches.
17 A man who is kind benefits himself,
 but a cruel man brings trouble on his own flesh.
18 The wicked earns deceptive wages,
 but one who sows righteousness gets a true reward.


19 Whoever is steadfast in righteousness will live,
 but he who pursues evil will bring about his own death.
20 Those of crooked heart are an abomination to the LORD,
 but those of blameless ways are His delight.
21 Be assured, the evil man will not go unpunished,
 but the descendents of the righteous will be delivered.


22 Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout
 is a beautiful woman without discretion.
23 The desire of the righteous ends only in good,
 but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
24 One gives freely, yet grows all the richer;
 another withholds what is right, and only suffers want.


25 A generous soul will be enriched,
 and he who waters will himself be watered.
26 The people curse him who holds back grain,
 but blessing is on the head of him who sells it.
27 He who diligently seeks good seeks favor,
 but evil comes to him who searches for it.


28 He who trusts in his riches will fall,
 but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf.
29 Whoever troubles his own household will inherit the wind,
 and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart.
30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,
 and he who wins souls is wise.
31 If the righteous is repaid on earth,
 how much more the wicked and the sinner!




Chapter 12


1 Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,
but he who hates reproof is stupid.
2 A good man obtains favor from the LORD,
but a man of wicked devices he condemns.
3 A man is not established by wickedness,
but the root of the righteous will not be moved.
4 A virtuous wife is the crown of her husband,
but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones.
5 The thoughts of the righteous are just,
but the counsels of the wicked are deceitful.
6 The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood,
but the mouth of the upright delivers them.
7 The wicked are overthrown and are no more,
but the house of the righteous will stand.
8 A man is praised according to his insight,
but one with a perverse heart will be despised.
9 Better is a man who is lightly esteemed and has a servant
than one who honors himself and lacks bread.
10 A righteous man regards the life of his animal,
but the compassion of the wicked is cruel.
11 He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,
but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense.
12 The wicked covets the plunder of evildoers,
but the root of the righteous yields fruit.
13 In the transgression of the lips there is a snare for the evil man,
but the righteous will escape from trouble.
14 From the fruit of a man’s mouth he is satisfied with good,
and the work of a man’s hands returns to him.
15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,
but a wise man listens to counsel.
16 A fool’s vexation is known at once,
but a prudent man overlooks an insult.
17 He who speaks truth declares righteousness,
but a false witness deceit.
18 There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts,
but the tongue of the wise brings healing.
19 Truthful lips endure forever,
but a lying tongue lasts but a moment.
20 Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil,
but those who plan peace have joy.
21 No harm befalls the righteous,
but the wicked are filled with trouble.
22 Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD,
but those who act faithfully are his delight.
23 A prudent man conceals knowledge,
but the heart of fools proclaims folly.
24 The hand of the diligent will rule,
but the slothful will be put to forced labor.
25 Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,
but a good word makes it glad.
26 The righteous chooses his friends carefully,
but the way of the wicked leads them astray.
27 The slothful man does not roast his prey,
but the possessions of the diligent are precious.
28 In the path of righteousness is life,
and in its pathway there is no death.




Chapter 13


1 A wise son accepts his father’s discipline,
but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.
2 From the fruit of a man’s mouth he eats what is good,
but the appetite of the treacherous is for violence.
3 He who guards his mouth preserves his life,
but he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.


4 The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing,
but the soul of the diligent is richly supplied.
5 A righteous man hates falsehood,
but a wicked man brings shame and disgrace.
6 Righteousness guards the way of the blameless,
but wickedness overthrows the sinner.


7 One pretends to be rich, yet has nothing;
another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.
8 The ransom of a man’s life is his wealth,
but a poor man hears no threat.
9 The light of the righteous rejoices,
but the lamp of the wicked goes out.


10 By pride comes only strife,
but with the humble is wisdom.
11 Wealth gained hastily will dwindle,
but he who gathers little by little will increase it.
12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life.


13 He who despises the word brings destruction on himself,
but he who respects the commandments will be rewarded.
14 The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life,
to turn one away from the snares of death.
15 Good sense wins favor,
but the way of the treacherous is their ruin.


16 Every prudent man acts with knowledge,
but a fool flaunts his folly.
17 A wicked messenger falls into trouble,
but a faithful envoy brings healing.
18 Poverty and shame come to him who ignores instruction,
but he who regards reproof will be honored.


19 A desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul,
but to turn away from evil is an abomination to fools.
20 He who walks with the wise becomes wise,
but a companion of fools will suffer harm.
21 Misfortune pursues sinners,
but the righteous are rewarded with good.


22 A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,
but the sinner’s wealth is laid up for the righteous.
23 The fallow ground of the poor yields much food,
but it is swept away through injustice.
24 He who spares the rod hates his son,
but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him.
25 The righteous eats to the satisfaction of his soul,
but the belly of the wicked will lack.




Chapter 14


1 A wise woman builds her house,
but the foolish tears it down with her own hands.
2 He who walks in uprightness fears the LORD,
but he who is devious in his ways despises Him.
3 In the mouth of a fool is a rod for his back,
but the lips of the wise protect them.
4 Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean,
but abundant harvest comes by the strength of the ox.
5 A faithful witness does not lie,
but a false witness breathes out lies.
6 A scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none,
but knowledge comes easily to one who understands.
7 Leave the presence of a foolish man,
for there you do not find lips of knowledge.
8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way,
but the folly of fools is deceit.
9 Fools mock guilt,
but among the upright there is goodwill.
10 The heart knows its own bitterness,
and no stranger shares in its joy.
11 The house of the wicked will be destroyed,
but the tent of the upright will flourish.
12 There is a way that seems right to a man,
but its end is the way of death.
13 Even in laughter the heart may ache,
and the end of joy may be sorrow.
14 The backslider in heart will be filled with his own ways,
but a good man will be satisfied from above.
15 The simple believes every word,
but the prudent gives thought to his steps.
16 A wise man fears and turns away from evil,
but the fool is arrogant and careless.
17 A quick-tempered man acts foolishly,
and a man of evil devices is hated.
18 The simple inherit folly,
but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
19 The evil bow down before the good,
and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
20 The poor is hated even by his neighbor,
but the rich has many friends.
21 He who despises his neighbor sins,
but he who shows kindness to the afflicted is blessed.
22 Do they not go astray who devise evil?
But lovingkindness and truth belong to those who plan good.
23 In all labor there is profit,
but mere talk leads only to poverty.
24 The crown of the wise is their riches,
but the folly of fools is only folly.
25 A truthful witness saves lives,
but one who breathes lies is deceitful.
26 In the fear of the LORD there is strong confidence,
and his children will have a refuge.
27 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life,
to turn away from the snares of death.
28 In a multitude of people is the king's glory,
but in the lack of people is the downfall of a prince.
29 He who is slow to anger has great understanding,
but he who is quick-tempered exalts folly.
30 A tranquil heart is life to the body,
but envy is rottenness to the bones.
31 He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker,
but he who honors Him shows kindness to the needy.
32 The wicked is overthrown by his own wrongdoing,
but the righteous has a refuge in his death.
33 Wisdom rests in the heart of him who has understanding,
but what is in the inner parts of fools is made known.
34 Righteousness exalts a nation,
but sin is a reproach to any people.
35 The king’s favor is toward a wise servant,
but his wrath is against him who causes shame.




Chapter 15


1 A soft answer turns away wrath,
but a harsh word stirs up anger.
2 The tongue of the wise makes knowledge attractive,
but the mouth of fools pours out folly.
3 The eyes of the LORD are in every place,
watching the evil and the good.


4 A healing tongue is a tree of life,
but perverseness in it breaks the spirit.
5 A fool despises his father's discipline,
but he who heeds correction is prudent.
6 In the house of the righteous there is much treasure,
but in the income of the wicked is trouble.


7 The lips of the wise spread knowledge,
but the hearts of fools are not upright.
8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD,
but the prayer of the upright is his delight.
9 The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD,
but he loves one who pursues righteousness.


10 Severe discipline is for him who forsakes the path,
and he who hates correction will die.
11 The grave and destruction lie open before the LORD,
how much more the hearts of the sons of man!
12 A scoffer does not love one who corrects him;
he will not go to the wise.


13 A glad heart makes a cheerful face,
but by sorrow of heart the spirit is crushed.
14 The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge,
but the mouth of fools feeds on folly.


15 All the days of the afflicted are evil,
but a cheerful heart has a continual feast.
16 Better is a little with the fear of the LORD
than great treasure with turmoil.
17 Better is a dish of vegetables where love is
than a fattened ox with hatred.


18 A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,
but he who is slow to anger quiets contention.
19 The way of the sluggard is like a hedge of thorns,
but the path of the upright is a highway.


20 A wise son makes a glad father,
but a foolish man despises his mother.
21 Folly is a joy to one who lacks sense,
but a man of understanding walks straight.


22 Without counsel plans fail,
but with many advisers they succeed.
23 A man has joy in an apt answer,
and how good is a word in its season!


24 The path of life leads upward for the wise,
that he may turn away from the grave below.
25 The LORD will tear down the house of the proud,
but he will establish the boundary of the widow.


26 Evil plans are an abomination to the LORD,
but gracious words are pure.
27 He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house,
but he who hates bribes will live.


28 The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer,
but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.
29 The LORD is far from the wicked,
but he hears the prayer of the righteous.


30 Bright eyes gladden the heart,
and good news strengthens the bones.
31 The ear that listens to life-giving reproof
will dwell among the wise.
32 He who ignores discipline despises himself,
but he who listens to correction gains understanding.


33 The fear of the LORD is instruction in wisdom,
and humility comes before honor.




Chapter 16


1 The plans of the heart belong to man,
but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.
2 All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes,
but the LORD weighs the spirit.
3 Commit your works to the LORD,
and your plans will be established.


4 The LORD has made everything for its purpose,
even the wicked for the day of trouble.
5 Everyone who is arrogant in heart is an abomination to the LORD;
be assured, he will not go unpunished.
6 By loyal love and truth is iniquity atoned for,
and by the fear of the LORD one turns away from evil.
7 When a man's ways please the LORD,
he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
8 Better is a little with righteousness
than great revenues with injustice.


9 The heart of man plans his way,
but the LORD establishes his steps.
10 A divine verdict is on the lips of a king;
his mouth must not be unfaithful in judgment.
11 Honest scales and balances belong to the LORD;
all the weights in the bag are his work.
12 It is an abomination for kings to do evil,
for the throne is made secure by righteousness.
13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings,
and he who speaks uprightly is loved.
14 The wrath of a king is a messenger of death,
but a wise man will appease it.
15 In the light of the king’s face there is life,
and his favor is like a cloud of the spring rain.


16 How much better to get wisdom than gold,
and to choose understanding rather than silver!
17 The highway of the upright turns aside from evil;
he who guards his way preserves his soul.
18 Pride goes before destruction,
and a haughty spirit before a fall.
19 Better to be of a humble spirit with the lowly
than to divide the spoil with the proud.


20 He who gives attention to the word will find good,
and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD.
21 The wise in heart will be called discerning,
and sweetness of speech increases learning.
22 Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,
but the discipline of fools is folly.
23 The heart of the wise makes his mouth prudent,
and adds learning to his lips.
24 Pleasant words are a honeycomb,
sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.


25 There is a way that seems right to a man,
but its end is the way of death.
26 A worker’s appetite works for him,
for his hunger urges him on.
27 A worthless man plots evil,
and his speech is like a scorching fire.
28 A perverse man spreads strife,
and a whisperer separates close friends.


29 A man of violence entices his neighbor
and leads him in a way that is not good.
30 He who winks his eyes devises perverse things;
he who purses his lips brings evil to pass.
31 Gray hair is a crown of glory;
it is gained in the way of righteousness.
32 He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty,
and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.
33 The lot is cast into the lap,
but every decision is from the LORD.




Chapter 17


1 Better a dry morsel with quiet
than a house full of feasting with strife.
2 A servant who acts wisely will rule over a disgraceful son,
and will share in the inheritance among brothers.
3 The crucible is for silver and the furnace for gold,
but the LORD tests hearts.
4 An evildoer listens to wicked lips,
a liar pays attention to a destructive tongue.
5 He who mocks the poor insults his Maker;
he who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished.
6 Grandchildren are the crown of old men,
and the glory of children is their fathers.
7 Fine speech is not fitting for a fool—
much less lying lips for a ruler.
8 A bribe is like a charm in the eyes of its giver;
wherever he turns, he succeeds.
9 He who covers an offense promotes love,
but he who repeats a matter separates close friends.
10 A rebuke sinks deeper into a discerning man
than a hundred blows into a fool.
11 An evil man seeks only rebellion,
and a cruel messenger will be sent against him.
12 Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs
than a fool in his folly.
13 He who returns evil for good—
evil will not depart from his house.
14 The beginning of strife is like letting out water,
so abandon the quarrel before it breaks out.
15 He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous—
both are an abomination to the LORD.
16 Why should a fool have money in his hand to buy wisdom,
when he has no heart for it?
17 A friend loves at all times,
and a brother is born for adversity.
18 A man lacking sense strikes hands in pledge
and puts up security for his neighbor.
19 He who loves transgression loves strife;
he who builds a high gate seeks destruction.
20 A crooked heart finds no good,
and a perverse tongue falls into trouble.
21 He who begets a fool does so to his sorrow,
and the father of a fool has no joy.
22 A joyful heart is good medicine,
but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
23 A wicked man takes a bribe in secret
to pervert the paths of justice.
24 Wisdom is before the face of the discerning,
but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.
25 A foolish son is grief to his father
and bitterness to her who bore him.
26 It is not good to punish the righteous,
nor to strike nobles for their integrity.
27 He who restrains his words has knowledge,
and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding.
28 Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is considered wise;
when he shuts his lips, he is deemed intelligent.




Chapter 18


1 He who isolates himself seeks his own desire;
he breaks out against all sound judgment.
2 A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,
but only in expressing his own opinion.
3 When wickedness comes, contempt also comes,
and with dishonor comes disgrace.
4 The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters;
the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.
5 It is not good to be partial to the wicked
or to deprive the righteous of justice.
6 A fool’s lips bring strife,
and his mouth invites a beating.
7 A fool’s mouth is his ruin,
and his lips are a snare to his soul.
8 The words of a whisperer are like tasty morsels;
they go down into the innermost parts of the body.
9 Whoever is slack in his work
is a brother to him who destroys.
10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower;
the righteous man runs into it and is safe.
11 A rich man’s wealth is his strong city,
and like a high wall in his own imagination.
12 Before destruction a man’s heart is haughty,
but humility comes before honor.
13 If one gives an answer before he hears,
it is his folly and shame.
14 A man’s spirit will endure sickness,
but a crushed spirit who can bear?
15 The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge,
and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
16 A man’s gift makes room for him
and brings him before the great.
17 The first to plead his case seems right,
until another comes and examines him.
18 The lot puts an end to disputes
and decides between powerful contenders.
19 A brother offended is more unyielding than a strong city,
and quarreling is like the bars of a fortress.
20 From the fruit of a man’s mouth his stomach is satisfied;
he is satisfied by the yield of his lips.
21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
and those who love it will eat its fruit.
22 He who finds a wife finds a good thing
and obtains favor from the LORD.
23 The poor man speaks with entreaties,
but the rich man answers roughly.
24 A man of many companions may come to ruin,
but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.




Chapter 19


1 Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity
than one who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.
2 Also, it is not good for a soul to be without knowledge,
and he who hurries with his feet misses the way.
3 A man’s own folly subverts his way,
yet his heart rages against the LORD.
4 Wealth adds many friends,
but the poor man is separated from his friend.
5 A false witness will not go unpunished,
and he who breathes lies will not escape.
6 Many seek the favor of a nobleman,
and every man is a friend to him who gives gifts.
7 All the brothers of a poor man hate him;
how much more do his friends keep far from him!
He pursues them with words, but they are gone.
8 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul;
he who keeps understanding will find good.
9 A false witness will not go unpunished,
and he who breathes lies will perish.
10 Luxury is not fitting for a fool,
much less for a slave to rule over princes.
11 A man’s discretion makes him slow to anger,
and it is his glory to overlook an offense.
12 The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion,
but his favor is like dew upon the grass.
13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father,
and a contentious wife is like a constant dripping.
14 House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers,
but a prudent wife is from the LORD.
15 Laziness casts into a deep sleep,
and the idle soul will suffer hunger.
16 He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul;
he who despises his ways will die.
17 He who shows kindness to the poor lends to the LORD,
and He will repay him for his deed.
18 Discipline your son while there is hope,
but do not set your heart on causing his death.
19 A man of great wrath will bear the penalty;
for if you rescue him, you will have to do it again.
20 Listen to counsel and receive instruction,
that you may be wise in your latter days.
21 Many are the plans in a man’s heart,
but the counsel of the LORD will stand.
22 The charm of a man is his kindness,
and it is better to be poor than a liar.
23 The fear of the LORD leads to life;
then one rests satisfied, untouched by evil.
24 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish,
and will not even bring it back to his mouth.
25 Strike a scoffer, and the simple will become prudent;
reprove one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.
26 He who plunders his father and drives away his mother
is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.
27 Cease, my son, to hear instruction
that causes you to stray from the words of knowledge.
28 A worthless witness mocks at justice,
and the mouth of the wicked swallows iniquity.
29 Judgments are prepared for scoffers,
and blows for the backs of fools.




Chapter 20


1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler,
and whoever is led astray by it is not wise.
2 The terror of a king is like the growl of a lion;
whoever provokes him to anger sins against his own life.
3 It is an honor for a man to avoid strife,
but every fool is quick to quarrel.
4 The sluggard does not plow in autumn;
he will seek at harvest and have nothing.
5 The purpose in a man’s heart is like deep water,
but a man of understanding will draw it out.
6 Many a man proclaims his own steadfast love,
but a faithful man who can find?
7 The righteous man walks in his integrity;
blessed are his children after him.
8 A king who sits on the throne of judgment
winnows all evil with his eyes.
9 Who can say, “I have made my heart pure;
I am clean from my sin”?
10 Unequal weights and unequal measures
are both alike an abomination to the LORD.
11 Even a child makes himself known by his deeds,
whether his conduct is pure and right.
12 The hearing ear and the seeing eye,
the LORD has made them both.
13 Do not love sleep, lest you come to poverty;
open your eyes, and you will have plenty of bread.
14 “Bad, bad,” says the buyer;
but when he goes his way, then he boasts.
15 There is gold, and an abundance of jewels,
but the lips of knowledge are a precious vessel.
16 Take a man’s garment when he has put up security for a stranger,
and hold it in pledge when it is for foreigners.
17 Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man,
but afterward his mouth will be full of gravel.
18 Plans are established by counsel;
by wise guidance wage war.
19 He who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets;
therefore do not associate with one who opens his lips.
20 Whoever curses his father or his mother,
his lamp will be put out in utter darkness.
21 An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning
will not be blessed in the end.
22 Do not say, “I will repay evil”;
wait for the LORD, and He will save you.
23 Unequal weights are an abomination to the LORD,
and false scales are not good.
24 A man’s steps are from the LORD;
how then can man understand his way?
25 It is a snare to say rashly, “It is holy,”
and to reflect only after making vows.
26 A wise king winnows the wicked
and drives the wheel over them.
27 The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD,
searching all the innermost parts.
28 Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king,
and by steadfast love his throne is upheld.
29 The glory of young men is their strength,
but the splendor of old men is their gray hair.
30 Blows that wound cleanse away evil;
strokes make clean the innermost parts.




Chapter 21


1 The king’s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD;
He turns it wherever He will.
2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,
but the LORD weighs the hearts.
3 To do righteousness and justice
is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
4 Haughty eyes and a proud heart—
the lamp of the wicked—is sin.
5 The plans of the diligent surely lead to abundance,
but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.
6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
is a fleeting vapor, a snare of death.
7 The violence of the wicked will sweep them away,
because they refuse to do what is just.
8 The way of a guilty man is crooked,
but the conduct of the pure is upright.
9 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop
than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife.
10 The soul of the wicked desires evil;
his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.
11 When a scoffer is punished, the simple become wise;
when the wise is instructed, he gains knowledge.
12 The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked;
He brings the wicked to ruin.
13 Whoever shuts his ear to the cry of the poor
will himself call and not be answered.
14 A gift in secret averts anger,
and a bribe in the bosom, strong wrath.
15 It is a joy to the righteous to do justice,
but terror to evildoers.
16 The man who wanders from the way of understanding
will rest in the assembly of the dead.
17 He who loves pleasure will be a poor man;
he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.
18 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous,
and the treacherous for the upright.
19 It is better to dwell in a desert land
than with a quarrelsome and fretful woman.
20 Precious treasure and oil are in the dwelling of the wise,
but a foolish man devours it.
21 He who pursues righteousness and steadfast love
will find life, righteousness, and honor.
22 A wise man scales the city of the mighty
and brings down the stronghold in which they trust.
23 Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue
keeps himself out of trouble.
24 “Scoffer” is the name of the arrogant, haughty man
who acts with arrogant pride.
25 The desire of the sluggard kills him,
for his hands refuse to labor.
26 All day long he craves and craves,
but the righteous gives and does not hold back.
27 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination—
how much more when he brings it with evil intent.
28 A false witness will perish,
but the man who listens will speak with knowledge.
29 A wicked man puts on a bold face,
but the upright gives thought to his ways.
30 No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel
can avail against the LORD.
31 The horse is made ready for the day of battle,
but the victory belongs to the LORD.




Chapter 22


1 A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth,
and favor is better than silver and gold.
2 The rich and the poor meet together;
the LORD is the Maker of them all.
3 The prudent sees danger and hides himself,
but the simple go on and suffer for it.
4 The reward for humility and the fear of the LORD
is riches and honor and life.
5 Thorns and snares are in the path of the crooked;
whoever guards his soul will keep far from them.
6 Train up a child in the way he should go;
even when he is old he will not turn from it.
7 The rich rules over the poor,
and the borrower is servant to the lender.
8 Whoever sows injustice will reap trouble,
and the rod of his fury will fail.
9 He who has a generous eye will be blessed,
for he shares his bread with the poor.
10 Drive out the scoffer, and strife will go out;
quarreling and abuse will cease.
11 He who loves purity of heart,
and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his friend.
12 The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge,
but He overthrows the words of the treacherous.
13 The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!
I shall be killed in the streets!”
14 The mouth of forbidden women is a deep pit;
he with whom the LORD is angry will fall into it.
15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,
but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.
16 Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth,
or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.
17 Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise,
and apply your heart to my knowledge.
18 For it will be pleasant if you keep them within you,
if all of them are ready on your lips.
19 That your trust may be in the LORD,
I make them known to you today, even to you.
20 Have I not written for you thirty sayings
of counsel and knowledge,
21 to make you know what is right and true,
that you may give a true answer to those who send you?
22 Do not rob the poor, because he is poor,
or crush the afflicted at the gate;
23 for the LORD will plead their cause
and rob of life those who rob them.
24 Make no friendship with a man given to anger,
nor go with a wrathful man,
25 lest you learn his ways
and entangle yourself in a snare.
26 Be not one of those who give pledges,
who put up security for debts.
27 If you have nothing with which to pay,
why should your bed be taken from under you?
28 Do not move the ancient landmark
that your fathers have set.
29 Do you see a man skillful in his work?
He will stand before kings;
he will not stand before obscure men.




Chapter 23


1 When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider carefully what is before you,
2 and put a knife to your throat if you are a man given to appetite.
3 Do not crave his delicacies, for they are deceptive food.


4 Do not toil to become rich; cease from your own understanding.
5 When your eyes look on it, it is gone, for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away like an eagle toward heaven.


6 Do not eat the bread of a stingy man, nor desire his delicacies,
7 for as he calculates within himself, so he is. “Eat and drink,” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
8 You will vomit the morsel you have eaten and waste your pleasant words.


9 Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.


10 Do not move the ancient boundary, and do not enter the fields of the fatherless,
11 for their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause against you.


12 Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.


13 Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him with the rod, he will not die.
14 You shall strike him with the rod and deliver his life from the grave.


15 My son, if your heart is wise, my heart too will rejoice;
16 my inmost being will exult when your lips speak what is right.


17 Do not let your heart envy sinners, but live in the fear of the LORD all day long.
18 For surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.


19 Hear, my son, and be wise, and direct your heart in the way.
20 Do not be among heavy drinkers of wine or among gluttonous eaters of meat,
21 for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe one with rags.


22 Listen to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old.
23 Buy truth and do not sell it—wisdom and instruction and understanding.


24 The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; he who fathers a wise son will delight in him.
25 Let your father and your mother be glad; let her who bore you rejoice.


26 My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes delight in my ways.
27 For a prostitute is a deep pit, and a wayward woman is a narrow well.
28 She lies in wait like a robber and increases the faithless among men.


29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?
30 Those who linger long over wine, those who go to seek mixed wine.
31 Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly.
32 In the end it bites like a serpent and stings like a viper.
33 Your eyes will see strange things, and your heart will utter perverse things.
34 You will be like one lying down in the midst of the sea, or like one lying on the top of a mast.
35 “They struck me,” you will say, “but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I will seek it again.”


***
Chapter 24


1 Do not envy men of evil, nor desire to be with them;
2 for violence is in their heart, and their lips speak of trouble.
3 By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established;
4 and by knowledge its rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant wealth.
5 A wise man is strong; and a man of knowledge increases power.
6 For by wise counsel you wage your war, and in the multitude of advisers there is safety.
7 Wisdom is as precious stones to a fool; in the gate he will not open his mouth.
8 He who devises evil is called a man of schemes.
9 The devising of foolishness is sin, and the scorner is an abomination to man.
10 If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small indeed.
11 Rescue those being led away to death; and those staggering to be slain, hold back.
12 For if you say, “We did not know this,” does He not weigh the hearts? And He who guards your soul knows; and He will repay man according to his work.
13 Eat honey, my son, for it is good; and the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.
14 So know wisdom for your soul; if you have found it, then there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.


15 Do not lurk, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; do not plunder his resting-place.
16 For a righteous man may fall seven times, and rise again; but the wicked stumble in calamity.
17 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles,
18 lest the LORD see, and it displease Him, and He turn His wrath away from him.


19 Do not fret because of evildoers, and do not envy the wicked;
20 for there will be no future for evil men; the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
21 My son, fear the LORD and the king; do not mingle with those given to change.
22 For their calamity will rise suddenly, and who knows the disaster of both of them?


23 These also are sayings of the wise: to show partiality in judgment is not good.
24 He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous”—peoples will curse him, nations will be angry with him.
25 But to those who correct him there will be delight; and a good blessing will come upon them.
26 Let lips kiss him who gives a right answer.


27 Prepare your work outside, and make it ready in the field for yourself; then afterwards build your house.
28 Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause; and do not deceive with your lips.
29 Do not say, “As he did to me, so will I do to him; I will repay the man according to his work.”


30 I passed by the field of a lazy man, and by the vineyard of a man without sense;
31 and lo, it was all overgrown with thorns; its surface was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down.
32 Then I looked, and considered; I saw, and received instruction.
33 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest;
34 and poverty will come on you like a robber, and want like an armed man.




Chapter 25


1 These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied.


2 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
 and the glory of kings to search a matter out.
3 The heavens for height, and the earth for depth,
 and the heart of kings is unsearchable.
4 Remove dross from silver,
 and a vessel comes forth for the smith.
5 Remove the wicked from before the king,
 and his throne will be established in righteousness.
6 Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king,
 and do not stand in the place of great men;
7 for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”
 than that you be brought low before a noble.


8 Do not go out hastily to contend,
 lest you do not know what to do in the end
 when your neighbor humiliates you.
9 Argue your case with your neighbor,
 but do not reveal another man’s secret,
10 lest he who hears shame you,
 and your bad report never turn away.


11 A word fitly spoken
 is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
12 Like a ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
 is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.
13 Like the cold of snow in harvest
 is a faithful messenger to those who send him,
 for he restores the life of his masters.
14 A man who boasts of a gift he does not give
 is like clouds and wind without rain.


15 By patience a ruler may be persuaded,
 and a soft tongue breaks a bone.
16 If you find honey, eat only what is enough for you,
 lest you be filled with it and vomit it.
17 Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,
 lest he be weary of you and hate you.


18 A man who bears false witness against his neighbor
 is a club, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
19 Trust in an unfaithful man in time of trouble
 is a broken tooth and a slipping foot.
20 One who removes a garment in cold weather,
 and vinegar on soda,
 is he who sings songs to a heavy heart.


21 If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat;
 and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;
22 for you will heap coals on his head,
 and the LORD will reward you.


23 The north wind brings forth rain,
 and a backbiting tongue an angry face.
24 It is better to live on the corner of a roof
 than with a quarrelsome woman in a house together.


25 Like cold water to a weary soul
 is good news from a distant land.
26 A righteous man who gives way before the wicked
 is a muddied spring and a polluted fountain.
27 It is not good to eat much honey,
 nor to seek out one’s own glory.
28 A man without self-control
 is a city broken down, without walls.




Chapter 26


1 Like snow in summer and rain in harvest,
 so honor is not fitting for a fool.
2 Like a fluttering sparrow, like a flying swallow,
 so a curse without cause does not come.


3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,
 and a rod for the back of fools.
4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
 lest you also become like him.
5 Answer a fool according to his folly,
 lest he be wise in his own eyes.


6 He who sends a message by the hand of a fool
 cuts off his own feet and drinks violence.
7 The legs of the lame hang useless;
 so is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
8 Like one who binds a stone in a sling
 is he who gives honor to a fool.
9 Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard
 is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
10 A master may form all things,
 but he who hires a fool hires passers-by.
11 As a dog returns to its vomit,
 so a fool repeats his folly.
12 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?
 There is more hope for a fool than for him.


13 The sluggard says, “A lion is in the road;
 a lion is in the streets.”
14 A door turns on its hinges,
 and a sluggard on his bed.
15 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
 he is weary of bringing it back to his mouth.
16 A sluggard is wiser in his own eyes
 than seven men who answer sensibly.


17 He who seizes a dog by the ears
 is a man passing by who gets involved in another’s quarrel.
18 Like a madman who throws firebrands,
 arrows, and death,
19 is the man who deceives his neighbor
 and says, “I was only joking.”


20 Where there is no wood, the fire goes out;
 and where there is no whisperer, contention quiets.
21 As charcoal to embers and wood to fire,
 so is a contentious man to kindle strife.
22 The words of a whisperer are like tasty morsels;
 they go down into the innermost parts.


23 Like silver glaze on earthenware
 are fervent lips with an evil heart.
24 He who hates disguises himself with his lips,
 but stores up deceit within him.
25 When he makes his voice gracious, do not trust him,
 for seven abominations are in his heart.
26 Though his hatred is covered by deceit,
 his wickedness will be revealed in the assembly.
27 He who digs a pit will fall into it,
 and he who rolls a stone, it will return upon him.
28 A lying tongue hates its crushed victims,
 and a flattering mouth brings ruin.




Chapter 27


1 Do not boast about tomorrow,
 for you do not know what a day will bring.


2 Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth;
 a stranger, and not your own lips.
3 A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty,
 but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.
4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming,
 but who can stand before jealousy?


5 Better is open rebuke
 than hidden love.
6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend,
 but profuse are the kisses of an enemy.
7 A full soul tramples honeycomb,
 but to a hungry soul everything bitter is sweet.
8 Like a bird wandering from its nest
 is a man wandering from his place.
9 Oil and perfume gladden the heart,
 and the sweetness of a friend comes from earnest counsel.
10 Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend,
 and do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity;
 better is a neighbor who is near
 than a brother who is far away.


11 Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,
 so that I may answer him who taunts me.
12 A prudent man sees danger and hides himself,
 but the simple pass on and suffer for it.


13 Take his garment who is surety for a stranger,
 and take a pledge from him for a foreign woman.
14 He who blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning—
 it will be counted as a curse to him.
15 A continual dripping on a rainy day
 and a quarrelsome woman are alike;
16 he who restrains her restrains the wind,
 and grasps oil with his right hand.


17 Iron sharpens iron,
 and a man sharpens the face of his friend.
18 He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
 and he who guards his master will be honored.
19 As water reflects a face,
 so a man’s heart reflects the man.
20 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied,
 and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.
21 The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold,
 and a man is tested by the praise he receives.
22 Though you crush a fool in a mortar
 with a pestle along with grain,
 his folly will not depart from him.


23 Know well the condition of your flock;
 set your heart to your herds,
24 for wealth is not forever,
 nor does a crown endure to all generations.
25 When the grass disappears and new growth is seen,
 and the herbs of the mountains are gathered,
26 lambs will provide your clothing,
 and goats the price of a field;
27 and there will be goats’ milk enough for your food,
 for the food of your household,
 and sustenance for your maidens.




Chapter 28


1 The wicked flee when no man pursues,
 but the righteous are as bold as a lion.


2 Because of the transgression of a land its princes are many,
 but by a man of understanding and knowledge it endures.
3 A poor man who oppresses the lowly
 is a sweeping rain that leaves no food.
4 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,
 but those who keep the law contend with them.
5 Evil men do not understand justice,
 but those who seek the LORD understand everything.


6 Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity
 than a perverse man who is rich.
7 He who keeps the law is a wise son,
 but he who keeps company with gluttons disgraces his father.
8 He who increases his wealth by interest and profit
 gathers it for him who shows grace to the poor.
9 He who turns his ear away from hearing the law—
 even his prayer is an abomination.


10 He who misleads the upright into an evil path
 will fall into his own pit,
 but the blameless will inherit good.
11 A rich man is wise in his own eyes,
 but a discerning poor man searches him out.


12 When the righteous triumph, there is great glory,
 but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
13 He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
 but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.
14 Happy is the man who is always cautious,
 but he who hardens his heart will fall into trouble.


15 A roaring lion and a charging bear
 is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
16 A prince lacking understanding is a great oppressor,
 but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days.
17 A man burdened with the blood of another
 will flee to the pit; let no man support him.
18 He who walks blamelessly will be delivered,
 but he who is crooked in his ways will fall at once.


19 He who works his land will have plenty of bread,
 but he who pursues worthless things will have plenty of poverty.
20 A faithful man will abound with blessings,
 but he who hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.
21 To show partiality is not good,
 yet for a piece of bread a man will do wrong.
22 A man with an evil eye hastens after wealth,
 and does not know that want will come upon him.
23 He who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor
 than he who flatters with the tongue.


24 He who robs his father or his mother and says, “It is no transgression,”
 is a companion to a destroyer.
25 A greedy man stirs up strife,
 but he who trusts in the LORD will prosper.
26 He who trusts in his own heart is a fool,
 but he who walks in wisdom will escape.
27 He who gives to the poor will lack nothing,
 but he who hides his eyes will receive many curses.


28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;
 but when they perish, the righteous increase.




Chapter 29


1 A man who stiffens his neck after many rebukes
will suddenly be broken without remedy.
2 When the righteous increase, a nation rejoices,
but when a wicked man rules, a nation groans.
3 A man who loves wisdom gladdens his father,
but one who keeps company with prostitutes wastes wealth.
4 By justice a king establishes a land,
but a man who takes bribes tears it down.
5 A man who flatters his neighbor
spreads a net for his feet.
6 In the transgression of a wicked man there is a snare,
but a righteous man sings and rejoices.
7 A righteous man cares for the cause of the poor,
but a wicked man understands nothing.
8 Scoffers set a city on fire,
but the wise turn away wrath.
9 When a wise man disputes with a fool,
the fool rages or laughs, and there is no rest.
10 Men of blood hate one who is blameless,
but the upright seek his life to protect it.
11 A fool gives full vent to his spirit,
but a wise man quietly holds it back.
12 If a ruler listens to lies,
all his servants become wicked.
13 The poor man and the oppressor meet together;
the LORD gives light to the eyes of both.
14 If a king judges the poor with truth,
his throne will be established forever.
15 A rod and reproof give wisdom,
but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.
16 When the wicked increase, transgression increases,
but the righteous will look on their downfall.
17 Discipline your son, and he will give you rest;
he will give delight to your soul.
18 Where there is no vision, a man casts off restraint,
but he who keeps the law is blessed.
19 A servant will not be corrected by words,
for he understands, yet he will not respond.
20 Do you see a man hasty in his words?
There is more hope for a fool than for him.
21 If a man pampers his servant from youth,
in the end that servant will act as a son.
22 A man of anger stirs up strife,
and a hot-tempered man commits many transgressions.
23 A man’s pride brings him low,
but a man of lowly spirit will obtain honor.
24 Whoever shares with a thief hates his own life;
he hears the oath to testify but says nothing.
25 The fear of man lays a snare,
but whoever trusts in the LORD is set secure.
26 Many seek the face of a ruler,
but a man’s justice comes from the LORD.
27 A wicked man is an abomination to the righteous,
and he who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.




Chapter 30


1 The words of Agur son of Jakeh—the utterance:
The man declares to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:


2 Surely I am more brutish than any man,
and I do not have a man’s understanding.
3 I have not learned wisdom,
nor do I know the knowledge of the Holy One.


4 Who has gone up to heaven and come down?
Who has gathered the wind in his fists?
Who has wrapped the waters in a garment?
Who has established all the ends of the earth?
What is his name, and what is his son’s name? You know.


5 Every word of God is refined;
he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
6 Do not add to his words
lest he reprove you and you be found a liar.


7 Two things I ask of you;
do not withhold them from me before I die:
8 Remove falsehood and lying far from me;
give me neither poverty nor riches—
feed me with the food allotted to me,
9 lest I become full and deny you and say, “Who is the LORD?”
or lest I become poor and steal
and profane the name of my God.


10 Do not slander a servant to his master,
lest he curse you and you be found guilty.


11 There is a generation that curses its father
and does not bless its mother.
12 There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes
yet is not washed from its filth.
13 There is a generation—how lofty are their eyes,
and their eyelids are lifted high.


14 There is a generation whose teeth are swords
and whose jaw teeth are knives,
to devour the afflicted from the earth
and the needy from among men.


15 The leech has two daughters: “Give” and “Give.”
Three things are never satisfied;
four never say, “Enough”:
16 the grave, and the barren womb,
the earth that is never filled with water,
and fire that never says, “Enough.”


17 The eye that mocks a father
and scorns obedience to a mother—
the ravens of the valley will pluck it out,
and the young eagles will eat it.


18 Three things are too wondrous for me,
and four I do not understand:
19 the way of an eagle in the sky,
the way of a serpent on a rock,
the way of a ship in the heart of the sea,
and the way of a man with a young woman.


20 This is the way of an adulterous woman:
she eats and wipes her mouth
and says, “I have done no wrong.”


21 Under three things the earth trembles,
and under four it cannot bear up:
22 under a servant when he becomes king,
and a fool when he is satisfied with food,
23 under a hated woman when she is married,
and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress.


24 Four things on the earth are small,
but they are exceedingly wise:
25 the ants are a people not strong,
yet they prepare their food in the summer;
26 the rock badgers are not a mighty people,
yet they make their house in the cliffs;
27 the locusts have no king,
yet they all march in ranks;
28 the lizard you can grasp with your hands,
yet it is in kings’ palaces.


29 Three things have a stately stride,
and four are stately in their walk:
30 the lion, mighty among beasts,
who does not turn back from anything;


31 the strutting rooster, or the he-goat,
and a king when his army is with him.


32 If you have been foolish in exalting yourself,
or if you have devised evil, put your hand to your mouth.
33 For pressing milk produces curds,
and pressing the nose produces blood,
and pressing anger produces strife.




Chapter 31


1 The words of Lemuel, king—the utterance
that his mother taught him:


2 What, my son?
And what, son of my womb?
And what, son of my vows?
3 Do not give your strength to women,
nor your ways to those who destroy kings.


4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
it is not for kings to drink wine,
nor for rulers to crave strong drink,
5 lest he drink and forget what is decreed,
and pervert the justice of any of the afflicted.


6 Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,
and wine to those bitter of soul;
7 let him drink and forget his poverty,
and let him remember his misery no more.


8 Open your mouth for the mute,
for the rights of all who are passing away.
9 Open your mouth, judge righteously,
and defend the poor and needy.


10 A woman of valor, who can find her?
Her worth is far beyond rubies.
11 The heart of her husband trusts in her,
and he will have no lack of gain.
12 She does him good and not harm
all the days of her life.


13 She seeks wool and flax
and works with willing hands.
14 She is like the merchant ships;
she brings her food from afar.
15 She rises while it is still night
and gives food to her household
and a portion to her maidservants.


16 She considers a field and buys it;
from the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
17 She girds her waist with strength
and makes her arms strong.
18 She perceives that her merchandise is good;
her lamp does not go out at night.
19 She stretches out her hands to the distaff,
and her palms grasp the spindle.


20 She opens her hand to the poor
and reaches out her hands to the needy.
21 She is not afraid for her household because of snow,
for all her household are clothed in scarlet.
22 She makes coverings for herself;
her clothing is fine linen and purple.


23 Her husband is known in the gates,
when he sits among the elders of the land.
24 She makes linen garments and sells them
and supplies sashes to the merchant.


25 Strength and splendor are her clothing,
and she laughs at the days to come.
26 She opens her mouth with wisdom,
and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
27 She watches over the ways of her household
and does not eat the bread of idleness.


28 Her children rise up and call her blessed;
her husband also, and he praises her:
29 “Many daughters have done valorously,
but you surpass them all.”


30 Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,
but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.
31 Give her the fruit of her hands,
and let her works praise her in the gates.﻿Ecclesiastes


Chapter 1


1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
2 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.
3 What profit does man have in all his labor which he does under the sun?


4 A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth stands forever.
5 The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises.
6 The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. Round and round goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns.
7 All the rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers go, there they return again.
8 All things are wearisome—man cannot express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.


9 What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.
10 Is there anything of which one might say, “See, this is new”? It has already been done in the ages which passed before us.
11 There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be remembrance of later things that are to come among those who will come after.


12 I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
13 And I gave my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven. It is a grievous task God has given to the sons of man to be afflicted with.
14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and I see that all is vanity and a chasing after the wind.
15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.


16 I said in my heart, “Behold, I have grown great and have become wise more than all who were before me over Jerusalem, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”
17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly—I perceived that this also is a chasing after wind.
18 For in much wisdom is much grief, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.




Chapter 2


1 I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.” But I saw that this also was vanity.
2 I said of laughter, “It is madness,” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?”
3 I searched with my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine—my heart still guiding me with wisdom—and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the sons of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.


4 I undertook great works. I built houses for myself. I planted vineyards for myself.
5 I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
6 I made myself pools of water from which to water a forest of growing trees.
7 I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, more than all who were before me in Jerusalem.
8 I also gathered for myself silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I got for myself male singers and female singers, and the delights of the sons of man—many concubines.


9 So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem, and still my wisdom remained with me.
10 And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my reward for all my toil.
11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done and the labor I had spent in doing it, and I saw that all was vanity and a chasing after the wind, and that there was no profit under the sun.


12 Then I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.
13 Then I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.
14 The wise man has eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. Yet I perceived that the same fate happens to all of them.
15 Then I said in my heart, “What happens to the fool will happen to me too. Why, then, have I been excessively wise?” And I said in my heart, “This also is vanity.”
16 For of the wise, as of the fool, there is no lasting remembrance, since in the days to come all will be forgotten. And how the wise man dies just like the fool!
17 So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all is vanity and a chasing after the wind.


18 And I hated all of the work at which I had labored under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will come after me.
19 And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the works in which I have labored and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
20 So I turned about and gave up my heart to despair over all the works in which I had labored under the sun.
21 For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom and knowledge and skill, yet he must leave it as an inheritance to one who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.


22 For what has man from all his labor and from the striving of his heart with which he labors under the sun?
23 For all his days are full of pain, and his occupation is grief. Even at night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.


24 There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and find enjoyment in his labor. This also, I have seen, is from the hand of God.
25 For who can eat and who can have enjoyment apart from Him?
26 For to the man who pleases Him, God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner He gives the task of gathering and collecting, only to give it to the one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after the wind.




Chapter 3


1 For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:
2 a time to be born and a time to die;
a time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted;
3 a time to kill and a time to heal;
a time to break down and a time to build up;
4 a time to weep and a time to laugh;
a time to mourn and a time to dance;
5 a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together;
a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;
6 a time to seek and a time to lose;
a time to keep and a time to cast away;
7 a time to tear and a time to sew;
a time to keep silent and a time to speak;
8 a time to love and a time to hate;
a time for war and a time for peace.


9 What gain does the worker have from his toil?
10 I have seen the task that God has given to the sons of man to be afflicted with.
11 He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out what God has done from beginning to end.


12 I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good as long as they live.
13 And also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor—this is the gift of God.


14 I know that whatever God does shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken from it. God has done it, so that men should fear before Him.
15 That which is has already been, and what is to be has already been, and God seeks what is pursued.


16 Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, wickedness was there, and in the place of righteousness, wickedness was there.
17 I said in my heart, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work.”


18 I said in my heart concerning the sons of man, “God is testing them, that they may see that they themselves are but beasts.”
19 For what happens to the sons of man and what happens to the beast is the same. As the one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beast, for all is vanity.
20 All go to one place. All are from the dust, and all return to the dust.
21 Who knows whether the breath of man goes upward and the breath of the beast goes downward to the earth?


22 So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for that is his portion. For who can bring him to see what will be after him?




Chapter 4


1 Then I turned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they have no comforter. On the side of their oppressors there is power, and they have no comforter.
2 And I praised the dead who had already died more than the living who are still alive.
3 But better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.


4 Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man's rivalry with his neighbor. This also is vanity and a chasing after the wind.
5 The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.
6 Better is a handful with rest than two handfuls with toil and a chasing after the wind.


7 I also saw this vanity under the sun:
8 There is one who is alone, without a companion—he has neither son nor brother—yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?” This also is vanity and an unhappy business.


9 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.
10 For if they fall, one will lift up his companion. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has no one to lift him up.
11 Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?
12 And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him—a threefold cord is not quickly broken.


13 Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to take advice.
14 For out of prison he came forth to reign, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.
15 Then I saw all the living who walk under the sun with a younger man, a usurper, trying to stand in his place.
16 There was no end to all the people, to all before them, yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after the wind.




Chapter 5


1 Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil.
2 Do not be quick with your mouth, and do not let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God. For God is in heaven and you are on earth; therefore let your words be few.
3 For a dream comes with much busyness, and a fool’s voice with many words.


4 When you vow a vow to God, do not delay to pay it, for He has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow.
5 It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.
6 Do not let your mouth lead your flesh into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?
7 For when dreams increase and there is an abundance of words, there is vanity. Better to fear God.


8 If you see the poor oppressed, while justice and righteousness are violated in the provinces, do not be astonished at the matter, for a high official is overseen by a still higher official, and there are yet higher ones over them.
9 But the profit of the land is in everything—a king is served by the field.


10 He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver, nor he who loves abundance with increase. This also is vanity.
11 When goods increase, they profit those who consume them. But what advantage is it to their owner except to look at them with his eyes?
12 Sweet is the sleep of the laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich does not let him sleep.


13 There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches kept by their owner to his harm,
14 and those riches perish in a bad venture. And he fathers a son, but he has nothing in his hand.
15 As he came from his mother’s womb, so shall he go again, as naked as he came. He shall take nothing from his labor that he can carry in his hand.
16 This also is a grievous evil: exactly as he came, so shall he go. And what profit does he have who toils for the wind?
17 Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness, with great vexation, sickness, and anger.


18 What I have seen to be good and fitting, is for a man to eat and drink and to enjoy the good in all his labor in which he toils under the sun during the few days of his life that God has given him—for this is his portion.
19 Moreover, everyone to whom God has given riches and wealth and the power to enjoy them, and to take his portion and rejoice in his labor—this is a gift of God.
20 For he will not often remember the days of his life, because God keeps him occupied with the joy of his heart.




Chapter 6


1 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavily on man:
2 a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God does not allow him to enjoy it. Instead, a stranger enjoys it. This is vanity; it is a grievous evil.


3 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better than he.
4 For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered.
5 Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds more rest than he.
6 Even if he lives a thousand years twice over, yet does not enjoy good—do not all go to the same place?


7 All the labor of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied.
8 For what advantage does the wise man have over the fool? And what does the poor man gain when he knows how to conduct himself properly before those who are alive?
9 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite. This also is vanity and a chasing after the wind.


10 Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to dispute with one stronger than him.
11 The more words, the more vanity, and what benefit does main gain from it?
12 For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell man what will come to be after him under the sun?




Chapter 7


1 A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of one’s death, than the day of one’s birth.
2 It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for this is how every man will end up, and then the living will take notice of their own mortality.
3 Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness of face the heart is made glad.
4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.


5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools.
6 For like the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of fools. This also is vanity.
7 Surely oppression makes a wise man foolish, and a bribe corrupts the heart.


8 Better is the end of a thing than its beginning, and the one who is patient in spirit is better than the one who is proud in spirit.
9 Do not be quick to become angry in your heart, for anger lodges in the heart of fools.
10 Do not say, “Why were the former days better than these?” For asking this does not come from wisdom.


11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance, and it is an advantage to those who see the sun.
12 For wisdom is a defense as money is a defense, but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.


13 Consider the work of God: who can make straight what He has made crooked?
14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.


15 I have seen everything in my vain days: there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness.
16 Do not be excessively righteous, and do not make yourself overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself?
17 Do not be excessively wicked, and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time?
18 It is good that you take hold of this, and also from that do not withhold your hand, for he who fears God will come forth from both of them.


19 Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.
20 Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.


21 Do not take to heart all the words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant cursing you.
22 For your heart knows that many times you yourself have cursed others.


23 All this I have tested by wisdom. I said, “I will be wise,” but it was far from me.
24 That which is far off and exceedingly deep—who can find it out?
25 I turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness of madness.


26 And I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her.
27 Look! This is what I have found, says the Preacher, adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things—
28 which my soul has still sought but not found: one man among a thousand I have found, but a woman among all these I have not found.
29 And yet, this alone I have found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.




Chapter 8


1 Who is like the wise man, and who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is softened.


2 I say: Keep the command of the king, and do so because of your oath to God.
3 Do not be hasty to leave his presence. Do not stand for an evil matter, for he does whatever he pleases.
4 For the word of the king is supreme, and who can say to him, “What are you doing?”
5 He who obeys a command will know no evil thing, and the wise heart will know the right time and the just way.
6 For there is a time and a method for every matter, even when a man's concerns lie heavy upon him.
7 For he does not know what will be, for who can tell him how it will be?
8 No man has power over the spirit to restrain the spirit, neither does he have power over the day of death. There is no discharge in war, and wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it.


9 All this I have seen, as I applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun, when man has power over another man to do him harm.


10 Then I saw the wicked buried—those who used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had done so. This also is vanity.
11 Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the sons of man is fully set in them to do evil.
12 Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his days, yet I know that it will be well with those who obey God, because they worship before Him.
13 But it will not be well with the wicked, and he shall not prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not worship before God.


14 There is a vanity that takes place on the earth: there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.


15 So I commended joy, for there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his labor through the days of his life that God gives him under the sun.


16 When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done on the earth—how neither day nor night do one's eyes see sleep—
17 then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, he cannot find it out.




Chapter 9


1 For I have taken all this to heart, even to examine all this: that the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hatred, man does not know; everything lies before Him.
2 It is the same for all: there is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked, for the good and for the clean and for the unclean, for the one who offers sacrifice and for the one who does not offer. As is the good man, so is the sinner; as is the one who swears an oath, so is the one who fears to swear.
3 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun: that one fate comes to all. Also the heart of the sons of man is full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.


4 But there is hope for one who is joined with all the living—for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
5 For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.
6 Their love and their hatred and their envy have already perished, and they no longer have a portion in anything that is done under the sun.


7 Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved your works.
8 Let your garments always be white, and do not let oil be lacking on your head.
9 Enjoy life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life that He has given you under the sun, all your vain days—for that is your portion in life and in your labor in which you toil under the sun.
10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom in the grave, where you are going.


11 Again I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the mighty, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to the knowledgeable, but time and chance happen to them all.
12 For man does not know his time. Like fish caught in an evil net, and like birds caught in a snare, so the sons of man are ensnared in a time of calamity when it suddenly falls upon them.


13 I also have seen this wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me:
14 There was a small city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and surrounded it and built great siegeworks against it.
15 But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he delivered the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
16 Then I said, “Wisdom is better than might,” yet the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heeded.
17 The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.




Chapter 10


1 Dead flies cause the perfumer’s ointment to stink and ferment; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
2 The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left.
3 Even when the fool walks on the road, his sense is lacking, and his words show everyone that he is a fool.


4 If the spirit of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place, for calmness lays great offenses to rest.
5 There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error that proceeds from a ruler:
6 folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place.
7 I have seen slaves on horses and princes walking like slaves on the ground.


8 He who digs a pit will fall into it, and he who breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent.
9 He who quarries stones may be hurt by them, and he who splits logs may be endangered by them.
10 If the iron is blunt and one does not sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one succeed.
11 If the serpent bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the charmer.


12 The words of a wise man’s mouth bring favor, but the lips of a fool consume him.
13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is wicked madness.
14 A fool multiplies words, though no man knows what will be—and who can tell him what will be after him?
15 The labor of fools wearies them, for they do not know the way to the city.


16 Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning!
17 Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes feast at the proper time—for strength and not for drunkenness!


18 Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through idle hands the house leaks.
19 Bread is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life, and money answers everything.
20 Even in your thoughts do not curse the king, and in your bedroom do not curse the rich, for a bird of the air may carry your voice, or some winged creature may report the matter.




Chapter 11


1 Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days.
2 Give a portion to seven, or even to eight, for you do not know what disaster may happen on the earth.


3 If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth; and if a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.
4 He who watches the wind will not sow, and he who looks at the clouds will not reap.
5 As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
6 In the morning sow your seed, and at evening do not withhold your hand, for you do not know which will prosper—this or that—or whether both alike will be good.


7 Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.
8 So if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all, but let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. All that comes is vanity.


9 Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.
10 Therefore remove vexation from your heart, and put away pain from your body, for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.




Chapter 12


1 Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;
2 before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;
3 in the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look through the windows are darkened;
4 and the doors on the street are shut, as the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low;
5 they are afraid also of what is high, and terrors are in the way; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along, and desire fails, because man is going to his eternal home, and the mourners go about in the street—
6 before the silver cord is snapped, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the cistern,
7 and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.


8 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity.


9 In addition to being wise, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge. He pondered and searched out and arranged many proverbs with care.
10 The Preacher sought to find words of delight, and uprightly he wrote words of truth.
11 The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings—they are given by one Shepherd.
12 My son, beware of anything beyond these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.


13 The end of the matter, all has been heard: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.
14 For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.﻿Song of Solomon


Chapter 1


1 The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.


2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! 
For your love is better than wine.
3 Your oils have a pleasing fragrance;
your name is poured-out oil;
therefore the maidens love you.
4 Draw me after you—let us run!
The king has brought me into his chambers.


We will rejoice and be glad in you;
we will praise your love more than wine.
Rightly do they love you.


5 I am black but beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem,
like the tents of Kedar,
like the curtains of Solomon.
6 Do not gaze at me because I am dark,
because the sun has scorched me.
My mother’s sons were angry with me;
they made me keeper of the vineyards,
but my own vineyard I have not kept.


7 Tell me, you whom my soul loves,
where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon;
for why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions?


8 If you do not know, most beautiful among women,
go forth in the footsteps of the flock and pasture your young goats beside the shepherds’ tents.


9 To a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots I compare you, my darling.
10 Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,
your neck with strings of beads.
11 We will make for you ornaments of gold with studs of silver.


12 While the king was at his table,
my perfume gave forth its fragrance.
13 My beloved is to me a pouch of myrrh
that lies all night between my breasts.
14 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En-Gedi.


15 Behold, you are beautiful, my darling;
behold, you are beautiful;
your eyes are like doves.


16 Behold, you are handsome, my beloved, indeed pleasant.
Our couch is luxuriant.
17 The beams of our house are cedars;
our rafters, cypresses.




Chapter 2


1 I am a rose of Sharon,
a lily of the valleys.


2 Like a lily among thorns,
so is my darling among the daughters.


3 Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,
so is my beloved among the young men.
In his shade I delighted to sit,
and his fruit was sweet to my taste.


4 He brought me into the house of wine,
and his banner over me was love.
5 Sustain me with raisin cakes,
refresh me with apples,
for I am sick with love.
6 His left hand is under my head,
and his right hand embraces me.
7 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
by the gazelles or by the does of the field,
that you not arouse or awaken love until it pleases.


8 The voice of my beloved!
Behold, he is coming,
leaping on the mountains,
bounding over the hills.
9 My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.
Behold, he is standing behind our wall,
looking through the windows,
peering through the lattice.


10 My beloved responded and said to me,
“Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.
11 For the winter has passed;
the rain is over and gone.
12 The blossoms have appeared in the land,
the time of singing has come,
and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
13 The fig tree ripens its figs,
and the vines in blossom give forth fragrance.
Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.”


14 O my dove, in the clefts of the rock,
in the hiding place of the cliff,
let me see your face, let me hear your voice;
for your voice is sweet, and your appearance is lovely.


15 Catch the foxes for us,
the little foxes that are ruining the vineyards,
for our vineyards are in blossom.


16 My beloved is mine and I am his;
he pastures his flock among the lilies.
17 Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved;
be like a gazelle or a young stag on the cleft mountains.




Chapter 3


1 On my bed by night I sought him whom my soul loves;
I sought him but did not find him.
2 I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares;
I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him but did not find him.
3 The watchmen who go about the city found me:
“Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”
4 Scarcely had I passed them when I found him whom my soul loves.
I held him and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house,
into the chamber of her who conceived me.


5 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
by the gazelles or the does of the field,
not to stir up or awaken love until it pleases.


6 Who is this coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke,
perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
with all the fragrant powders of the merchant?
7 Behold, it is Solomon’s litter!
Around it are sixty mighty men,
of the mighty men of Israel,
8 all of them armed with swords and expert in war,
each with his sword at his thigh, against fear in the night.
9 King Solomon made himself a carriage from the wood of Lebanon.
10 He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple;
its interior was inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.


11 Go out, O daughters of Zion, and look upon King Solomon,
with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding,
on the day of the gladness of his heart.




Chapter 4


1 Behold, you are beautiful, my darling;
behold, you are beautiful.
Your eyes are doves behind your veil.
Your hair is like a flock of goats
that descend from Mount Gilead.
2 Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes
that have come up from the washing,
all of which bear twins,
and none among them has lost her young.
3 Your lips are like a scarlet thread,
and your mouth is lovely.
Your cheeks behind your veil are like halves of a pomegranate.
4 Your neck is like the tower of David,
built in rows of stone;
on it hang a thousand shields,
all of them shields of warriors.
5 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle,
that graze among the lilies.


6 Until the day breathes and the shadows flee,
I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.
7 You are altogether beautiful, my darling;
there is no blemish in you.


8 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride;
come with me from Lebanon.
Depart from the peak of Amana,
from the summit of Senir and Hermon,
from the dens of lions,
from the mountains of leopards.


9 You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride;
you have captured my heart with one glance of your eyes,
with one jewel of your necklace.
10 How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!
How much better is your love than wine,
and the fragrance of your oils than all spices!
11 Your lips drip nectar, my bride;
honey and milk are under your tongue;
the scent of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon.


12 A locked garden is my sister, my bride,
a locked spring, a sealed fountain.
13 Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates
with choice fruits, henna with nard,
14 nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,
with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes,
with all the chief spices—
15 a garden spring, a well of living water,
and flowing streams from Lebanon.


16 Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind!
Blow upon my garden, let its fragrance be wafted abroad.
Let my beloved come to his garden and eat its choicest fruits.




Chapter 5


1 I have come to my garden, my sister, my bride;
I have gathered my myrrh with my spice,
I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey,
I have drunk my wine with my milk.
Eat, friends; drink and be drunk with love.


2 I was asleep, but my heart was awake.
The sound of my beloved knocking:
“Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one,
for my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.”
3 I had taken off my garment; how could I put it on again?
I had washed my feet; how could I soil them again?
4 My beloved put his hand through the opening,
and my heart was stirred for him.
5 I arose to open to my beloved,
and my hands dripped with myrrh,
my fingers with flowing myrrh,
on the handles of the bolt.
6 I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned away and was gone.
My soul failed when he spoke.
I sought him, but did not find him;
I called him, but he gave no answer.
7 The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city;
they struck me, they wounded me;
the guards on the walls took my cloak from me.
8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
if you find my beloved, that you tell him I am faint with love.


9 What is your beloved more than another beloved,
O most beautiful among women?
What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you so charge us?


10 My beloved is radiant and ruddy,
distinguished among ten thousand.
11 His head is pure gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven.
12 His eyes are like doves beside streams of water,
bathed in milk, set like jewels.
13 His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding fragrance;
his lips are lilies, dripping flowing myrrh.
14 His arms are rods of gold, set with beryl;
his body is polished ivory, overlaid with sapphires.
15 His legs are pillars of alabaster, set on pedestals of fine gold.
His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.
16 His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether desirable.
This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.




Chapter 6


1 Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women?
Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?


2 My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices,
to graze in the gardens and to gather lilies.
3 I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine;
he grazes among the lilies.


4 You are beautiful as Tirzah, my darling,
lovely as Jerusalem, awe-inspiring as bannered hosts.
5 Turn your eyes away from me, for they overwhelm me.
Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Gilead.
6 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes coming up from the washing,
all of them bearing twins, and not one among them has lost her young.
7 Like a slice of pomegranate is your temple behind your veil.
8 There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and maidens without number,
9 but my dove, my perfect one, is unique—she is the only one of her mother,
the favorite of her who bore her.
The daughters saw her and called her blessed;
the queens and concubines praised her:


10 “Who is this that looks forth like the dawn,
fair as the moon, clear as the sun,
awe-inspiring as bannered hosts?”


11 I went down to the grove of nut trees to see the blossoms of the valley,
to see whether the vine had budded, whether the pomegranates were in bloom.
12 Before I knew it, my soul had set me among the chariots of my noble people.


13 Return, return, O Shulammite! Return, return, that we may look upon you.
Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as upon the dance of Mahanaim?




Chapter 7


1 How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O noble daughter!
The curves of your hips are like ornaments, the work of a master’s hand.
2 Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine;
your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies.
3 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.


4 Your neck is like a tower of ivory;
your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim;
your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, which looks toward Damascus.
5 Your head crowns you like Carmel, and the flowing locks of your head are like purple;
a king is held captive in the tresses.


6 How beautiful and how pleasant you are, O love, with your delights!
7 Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters.
8 I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit stalks.”
May your breasts be like clusters of the vine,
and the scent of your breath like apples,
9 and your mouth like the best wine.


It goes down smoothly for my beloved,
gliding over lips and teeth.
10 I am my beloved’s, and his desire is for me.


11 Come, my beloved, let us go out into the field;
let us lodge in the villages.
12 Let us go out early to the vineyards;
let us see whether the vine has budded,
whether the blossoms have opened,
and the pomegranates are in bloom.
There I will give you my love.
13 The mandrakes give off fragrance,
and at our doors are all kinds of precious fruits,
new as well as old,
which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.




Chapter 8


1 Oh, that you were like a brother to me, who nursed at my mother's breasts!
If I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.
2 I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother—she who taught me.
I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranate.
3 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.
4 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases.


5 Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved?
Under the apple tree I awakened you;
there your mother was in labor with you;
there she who bore you was in labor.


6 Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm,
for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave.
Its flashes are flashes of fire, the very flame of the LORD.
7 Many waters cannot quench love, nor can floods drown it.
If a man offered all the wealth of his house for love,
he would be utterly despised.


8 We have a little sister, and she has no breasts.
What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for?
9 If she is a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver;
but if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
10 I was a wall, and my breasts were like towers;
then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace.


11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
he let out the vineyard to keepers;
each one was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.
12 My vineyard, my very own, is before me;
you, O Solomon, may have the thousand,
and the keepers of the fruit two hundred.


13 You who dwell in the gardens, companions are listening for your voice;
let me hear it.
14 Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle
or a young stag on the mountains of spices.﻿Isaiah


Chapter 1


1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.


2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD has spoken:
“I have reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against Me.
3 The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's manger,
but Israel does not know; My people do not understand.”


4 Woe to the sinful nation, a people heavy with iniquity,
offspring of evildoers, children who deal corruptly!
They have forsaken the LORD, they have despised the Holy One of Israel,
they are utterly estranged.


5 Why will you still be struck down? Why will you continue to rebel?
The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
6 From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it,
but wounds, bruises, and raw sores;
they have not been pressed out or bound up or softened with oil.


7 Your country lies desolate; your cities are burned with fire;
in your presence foreigners devour your land—
it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.
8 And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard,
like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.


9 If the LORD of hosts had not left us a few survivors,
we would have become like Sodom, we would have resembled Gomorrah.


10 Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom!
Give ear to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
11 “What is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me?” says the LORD.
“I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed beasts;
I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.


12 When you come to appear before Me, who has required of you this trampling of My courts?
13 Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to Me.
New moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations—
I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.
14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts My soul hates;
they have become a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.
15 When you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you;
even though you make many prayers, I will not listen;
your hands are full of blood.


16 Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean;
remove the evil of your deeds from before My eyes; cease to do evil,
17 learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression;
bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause.


18 Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD:
though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.
19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;
20 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword;
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”


21 How the faithful city has become a harlot,
she who was full of justice!
Righteousness lodged in her—
but now murderers.
22 Your silver has become dross,
your wine mixed with water.
23 Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves.
Everyone loves a bribe and runs after gifts.
They do not bring justice to the fatherless,
and the widow’s cause does not come to them.


24 Therefore the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, declares:
“Ah, I will get relief from My adversaries
and avenge Myself on My enemies.
25 I will turn My hand against you
and will smelt away your dross as with lye
and remove all your alloy.
26 And I will restore your judges as at the first,
and your counselors as at the beginning.
Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness,
the faithful city.”


27 Zion shall be redeemed by justice,
and those in her who repent, by righteousness.
28 But rebels and sinners shall be broken together,
and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
29 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks that you desired,
and you shall blush for the gardens that you have chosen.
30 For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers,
and like a garden without water.
31 And the strong shall become tinder,
and his work a spark,
and both of them shall burn together,
with no one to quench them.




Chapter 2


1 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.


2 It shall come to pass in the latter days
that the mountain of the house of the LORD
shall be established as the highest of the mountains,
and shall be lifted up above the hills;
and all nations shall flow to it.


3 And many peoples shall come and say:
“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,
to the house of the God of Jacob,
that He may teach us His ways
and that we may walk in His paths.”
For out of Zion shall go forth the law,
and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.


4 He shall judge between the nations,
and shall decide for many peoples;
and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
and their spears into pruning hooks;
nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war anymore.


5 O house of Jacob,
come, let us walk in the light of the LORD.


6 For You have rejected Your people, the house of Jacob,
because they are full of things from the east
and of soothsayers like the Philistines,
and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
7 Their land is filled with silver and gold,
and there is no end to their treasures;
their land is filled with horses,
and there is no end to their chariots.
8 Their land is filled with idols;
they bow down to the work of their hands,
to what their own fingers have made.
9 So man is humbled, and mankind is brought low—
do not forgive them!


10 Enter into the rock and hide in the dust
from before the terror of the LORD
and from the splendor of His majesty.
11 The haughty eyes of man shall be brought low,
and the lofty pride of men shall be humbled,
and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.


12 For the LORD of hosts has a day
against all that is proud and lofty,
against all that is lifted up—and it shall be brought low—
13 against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up,
and against all the oaks of Bashan;
14 against all the high mountains,
and against all the lifted-up hills;
15 against every high tower,
and against every fortified wall;
16 against all the ships of Tarshish,
and against all the beautiful craft.


17 And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled,
and the lofty pride of men shall be brought low,
and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.


18 And the idols shall utterly pass away.
19 And people shall enter the caves of the rocks
and the holes of the ground,
from before the terror of the LORD
and from the splendor of His majesty,
when He rises to terrify the earth.


20 In that day mankind will cast away
their idols of silver and their idols of gold,
which they made for themselves to worship,
to the moles and to the bats,
21 to enter the caverns of the rocks
and the clefts of the cliffs,
from before the terror of the LORD
and from the splendor of His majesty,
when He rises to terrify the earth.


22 Stop regarding man, whose breath is in his nostrils,
for of what account is he?




Chapter 3


1 For behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts,
is departing from Jerusalem and from Judah
supply and support,
the whole supply of bread,
and the whole supply of water;
2 the mighty man and the warrior,
the judge and the prophet,
the diviner and the elder,
3 the captain of fifty and the man of rank,
the counselor and the skillful craftsman,
and the expert in spells.


4 And I will make boys their princes,
and infants shall rule over them.
5 And the people will oppress one another,
every man his fellow
and every man his neighbor;
the youth will be arrogant toward the elder,
and the base toward the honorable.


6 When a man takes hold of his brother
in the house of his father, saying,
“You have a cloak,
you shall be our leader,
and this heap of ruins
shall be under your hand”—
7 in that day he will cry out, saying,
“I will not be a healer;
in my house there is neither bread nor cloak;
you shall not make me
leader of the people.”


8 For Jerusalem has stumbled,
and Judah has fallen,
because their speech and their deeds are against the LORD,
defying the eyes of His glory.
9 The expression of their faces bears witness against them;
they proclaim their sin like Sodom;
they do not hide it.
Woe to them!
For they have brought evil on themselves.
10 Tell the righteous that it shall be well with him,
for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
11 Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him,
for what his hands have dealt out shall be done to him.


12 My people—infants are their oppressors,
and women rule over them.
O my people, your leaders lead you astray
and destroy the way of your paths.
13 The LORD has taken His stand to contend;
He stands to judge the nations.


14 The LORD will enter into judgment
with the elders and princes of His people:
“It is you who have devoured the vineyard;
the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
15 What do you mean by crushing My people,
by grinding the face of the poor?”
declares the Lord GOD of hosts.


16 The LORD said:
Because the daughters of Zion are haughty
and walk with outstretched necks,
glancing wantonly with their eyes,
mincing as they go,
tinkling with their feet,
17 therefore the Lord will strike with a scab
the heads of the daughters of Zion,
and the LORD will lay bare their secret parts.


18 In that day the Lord will take away
the finery of the anklets, the headbands, and the crescents;
19 the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarves;
20 the headdresses, the armlets, the sashes,
the perfume boxes, and the amulets;
21 the signet rings and nose rings;
22 the festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags;
23 the mirrors, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.


24 Instead of perfume there will be rottenness;
and instead of a belt, a rope;
and instead of well-set hair, baldness;
and instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth;
branding instead of beauty.


25 Your men shall fall by the sword,
and your mighty men in battle.
26 And her gates shall lament and mourn;
and she shall sit on the ground, abandoned.




Chapter 4


1 And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying,
“We will eat our own bread
and wear our own clothes;
only let us be called by your name—
take away our reproach.”
2 In that day the Branch of the LORD shall be beautiful and glorious,
and the fruit of the land shall be the pride and glory
of the survivors of Israel.


3 And it shall come to pass
that he who is left in Zion
and remains in Jerusalem
shall be called holy,
everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem,
4 when the Lord shall have washed away
the filth of the daughters of Zion
and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem
from its midst
by a spirit of judgment
and by a spirit of burning.


5 Then the LORD will create
over the whole site of Mount Zion
and over her assemblies
a cloud by day,
and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night;
for over all the glory there will be a canopy.
6 There will be a booth for shade by day from the heat,
and for a refuge and shelter from storm and rain.




Chapter 5


1 Let me sing for my beloved
my love song concerning his vineyard:
My beloved had a vineyard
on a very fertile hill.
2 He dug it and cleared it of stones,
and planted it with choice vines;
he built a watchtower in the midst of it,
and hewed out a winepress in it;
he expected it to yield grapes,
but it yielded wild grapes.
3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem
and men of Judah,
judge between me and my vineyard.
4 What more was there to do for my vineyard,
that I have not done in it?
When I expected it to yield grapes,
why did it yield wild grapes?
5 And now I will tell you
what I will do to my vineyard:
I will remove its hedge,
and it shall be devoured;
I will break down its wall,
and it shall be trampled down.
6 I will make it a waste;
it shall not be pruned or hoed,
and briers and thorns shall grow up;
I will also command the clouds
that they rain no rain upon it.
7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts
is the house of Israel,
and the men of Judah
are his pleasant planting;
he expected justice, but only sees bloodshed;
righteousness, but behold, an outcry.


8 Woe to those who join house to house,
who add field to field,
until there is no more room,
and you are made to dwell alone
in the midst of the land!
9 The LORD of hosts has sworn in my hearing:
Surely many houses shall be desolate,
large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.
10 For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath,
and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.


11 Woe to those who rise early in the morning,
that they may run after strong drink,
who tarry late into the evening
as wine inflames them!
12 They have lyre and harp,
tambourine and flute and wine at their feasts,
but they do not regard the deeds of the LORD,
or see the work of his hands.
13 Therefore my people go into exile
for lack of knowledge;
their honored men go hungry,
and their multitude is parched with thirst.


14 Therefore the grave has enlarged its appetite
and opened its mouth beyond measure,
and the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude will go down,
her revelers and he who exults in her.
15 Man is bowed down,
and each one is brought low,
and the eyes of the haughty are humbled.
16 But the LORD of hosts is exalted in justice,
and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.
17 Then shall the lambs graze as in their pasture,
and nomads shall eat among the ruins of the rich.


18 Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,
and sin as with cart ropes,
19 who say, “Let him be quick,
let him speed his work
that we may see it;
let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near
and come to pass,
that we may know it!”


20 Woe to those who call evil good
and good evil,
who put darkness for light
and light for darkness,
who put bitter for sweet
and sweet for bitter!
21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,
and prudent in their own sight!
22 Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine,
and valiant men in mixing strong drink,
23 who acquit the guilty for a bribe,
and deprive the innocent of his right!


24 Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,
and as dry grass sinks down in the flame,
so their root will be as rottenness,
and their blossom go up like dust;
for they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts,
and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
25 Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people,
and he stretched out his hand against them and struck them,
and the mountains trembled,
and their corpses were as refuse in the midst of the streets.
For all this his anger has not turned away,
and his hand is still stretched out.
26 He will raise a signal for nations far away,
and whistle for them from the ends of the earth;
and observe how quickly, speedily they come!


27 None is weary, none stumbles,
none slumbers or sleeps,
not a waistband is loose,
not a sandal strap broken;
28 their arrows are sharp,
all their bows bent,
their horses’ hooves seem like flint,
and their wheels like the whirlwind.
29 Their roaring is like a lion,
like young lions they roar;
they growl and seize their prey;
they carry it off, and none can rescue.
30 They will growl over it on that day,
like the growling of the sea.
And if one looks to the land, they see darkness and distress;
and the light is darkened by its clouds.




Chapter 6


1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and the hem of his robe filled the temple.
2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
3 And one called to another and said:
“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts;
the whole earth is full of his glory!”
4 The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of the one who called, and the house was filled with smoke.


5 Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone; I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips—for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!”
6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, holding a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.
7 And he touched my mouth and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin is atoned for.”


8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”
Then I said, “Here I am! Send me.”
9 And he said, “Go, and say to this people:
‘Keep on hearing, but do not understand;
keep on seeing, but do not perceive.’
10 Make the heart of this people dull,
and make their ears heavy,
and blind their eyes;
lest they see with their eyes,
and hear with their ears,
and understand with their heart,
and turn and be healed.”


11 Then I said, “How long, O Lord?”
And he said,
“Until cities lie waste without inhabitant,
and houses without people,
and the land is a desolate waste,
12 and the LORD removes people far away,
and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
13 Even if a tenth remains in it,
it will be burned again,
like a terebinth or an oak,
whose stump remains when it is felled.”
The holy seed is its stump.




Chapter 7


1 In the days of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but they were not able to prevail against it.
2 When it was reported to the house of David, “Syria is allied with Ephraim,” the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people trembled, as the trees of the forest tremble before the wind.


3 Then the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field,
4 and say to him, ‘Take care and be quiet. Do not fear or be fainthearted because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands—for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah.
5 Because Syria, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has planned evil against you, saying,
6 “Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it”—
7 thus says the Lord GOD, “It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass.
8 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered so that it will no longer be a people.
9 The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not stand firm in faith, you will not stand at all.”’”


10 Then the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
11 “Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be as deep as the grave or as high as heaven.”
12 But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, nor will I test the LORD.”
13 Then he said, “Hear now, O house of David: Is it not enough for you to weary men, that you must also weary my God?
14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
15 He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse what is evil and choose good.
16 For before the boy knows how to refuse what is evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread will be forsaken.
17 The LORD will bring upon you, and upon your people and upon your father’s house, days unlike any since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria.”
18 On that day the LORD will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
19 And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the clefts of the rocks and on all the thornbushes and on all the pastures.
20 On that day the Lord will shave with a razor hired beyond the River—with the king of Assyria—the head and the hair of the legs, and it will also sweep away the beard.
21 On that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep,
22 and because of the abundance of milk they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey.
23 On that day every place where there were a thousand vines, worth a thousand silver shekels, will become briars and thorns.
24 With arrows and with a bow one will come there, for the land will be full of briars and thorns.
25 And as for all the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you will not go there for fear of briars and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.




Chapter 8


1 Then the LORD said to me, “Take a large tablet and write on it in common script, ‘Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz.’
2 And I will take for myself faithful witnesses—Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah—to witness it.”


3 And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, “Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
4 for before the boy knows how to cry ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.”


5 The LORD spoke to me again:
6 “Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices in Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
7 therefore, the Lord is bringing up against them the mighty and abundant waters of the River—the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will rise over all its channels and overflow all its banks.
8 It will sweep into Judah, it will overflow and pass through, reaching up to the neck, and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.”


9 Be shattered, O peoples, and be broken in pieces; give ear, all you distant parts of the earth; gird yourselves, yet be broken; gird yourselves, yet be broken.
10 Devise a plan, but it will come to nothing; speak a word, but it will not stand, for God is with us.


11 For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,
12 “Do not call conspiracy everything this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread.
13 But the LORD of hosts—him you shall regard as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
14 And he will become a sanctuary—but also a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
15 And many shall stumble upon it; they shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.”


16 Bind up the testimony, seal the teaching among my disciples.
17 I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.
18 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.


19 And when they say to you, “Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers who whisper and mutter,” should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living?
20 To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because the dawn does not illuminate them.
21 They will pass through the land distressed and hungry, and when they are hungry, they will be enraged and curse their king and their God. They will look upward,
22 then look to the earth, but behold, only distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be driven into thick darkness.




Chapter 9


1 But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt, but in the latter time he will make it glorious—by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.


2 The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; those dwelling in the land of deep darkness, upon them the light has shone.
3 You have multiplied the people, you have increased their joy; they rejoice before you as with the joy of harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
4 For the yoke of his burden, and the staff upon his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.
5 For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire.


6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government will be upon his shoulder. And his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
7 Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.


8 The Lord sent a word against Jacob, and it fell upon Israel.
9 And all the people will know—Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria—who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,
10 “The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will replace them with cedars.”
11 But the LORD raises the adversaries of Rezin against him and stirs up his enemies—
12 Aram on the east and the Philistines on the west—and they devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is still outstretched.


13 Yet the people did not return to him who struck them, nor did they seek the LORD of hosts.
14 So the LORD cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed, in one day.
15 The elder and honored man is the head, and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail.
16 For those who guide this people lead them astray, and those who are guided by them are swallowed up.
17 Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men, nor does he have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is profane and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is still outstretched.


18 For wickedness burns like a fire; it consumes briers and thorns; it kindles the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
19 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts the land is scorched, and the people are like fuel for the fire; no one spares his brother.
20 They slice meat on the right but are still hungry; they devour on the left but are not satisfied. Each one eats the flesh of his own arm—
21 Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim devours Manasseh; together they are against Judah. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is still outstretched.




Chapter 10


1 Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees, and to the scribes who write oppression,
2 to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil and that they may make the fatherless their prey!
3 What will you do on the day of punishment, in the ruin that will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth?
4 Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is still outstretched.


5 Woe to Assyria, the rod of my anger; the staff in their hand is my indignation.
6 I send him against a godless nation, and I command him against the people of my wrath, to seize the spoil and carry off plunder, and to trample them down like the mire of the streets.
7 But he does not intend to do so, and his heart does agree; rather, it is in his heart to destroy and to cut off many nations.
8 For he says, “Are not my commanders all kings?
9 Isn't Calno like Carchemish? Isn't Hamath like Arpad? Isn't Samaria like Damascus?
10 As my hand has reached the kingdoms of the idols—whose carved images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria—
11 shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols just as I have done to Samaria and her images?”


12 But when the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, he will punish the speech of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes.
13 For he says, “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding. I remove the boundaries of peoples and plunder their treasures; like a bull I bring down those who sit on thrones.
14 My hand has found, like a nest, the wealth of the peoples; and as one gathers eggs that are forsaken, I have gathered all the earth. And there was none that flapped a wing or opened the mouth or chirped.”


15 Shall the axe boast over him who hews with it, or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield him who lifts it, or a staff should lift him who is not wood!
16 Therefore the Lord, the LORD of hosts, will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors, and under his glory a burning will be kindled, like the burning of fire.
17 The light of Israel will become a fire, and his Holy One a flame, and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.
18 The glory of his forest and of his fruitful land the LORD will destroy, both soul and body, and it will be as when a sick man wastes away.
19 The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child can write them down.


20 On that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no longer rely on him who struck them, but will rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
21 A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the Mighty God.
22 For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness.
23 For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst of all the earth.


24 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts: “O my people who dwell in Zion, do not be afraid of Assyria when he strikes with the rod and lifts up his staff against you as the Egyptians did.
25 For in a very little while my indignation will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction.”
26 And the LORD of hosts will wield against him a whip, as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb; and his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift it as he did in Egypt.
27 And on that day his burden will depart from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck, and the yoke will be broken because of the fatness.


28 He has come to Aiath; he has passed through Migron; at Michmash he stores his baggage.
29 They have crossed over the pass; at Geba they lodge for the night. Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul has fled.
30 Cry aloud, O daughter of Gallim! Listen, O Laishah! Poor Anathoth!
31 Madmenah is in flight; the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
32 This very day he will halt at Nob; he will shake his fist at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.


33 See how the Lord, the LORD of hosts, will lop the boughs with terrifying power; the tall ones will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.
34 He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an axe, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.




Chapter 11


1 A shoot will come forth from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit.
2 The Spirit of the LORD will rest upon him—the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
3 His delight will be in the fear of the LORD. He will not judge by what his eyes see, nor decide by what his ears hear,
4 but with righteousness he will judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.
5 Righteousness will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins.


6 The wolf will dwell with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together; and a little child will lead them.
7 The cow and the bear will graze; their young will lie down together; and the lion will eat straw like the ox.
8 The nursing child will play over the hole of the cobra, and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper’s den.
9 They will not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.


10 In that day the root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples; to him the nations will seek, and his resting place will be glorious.


11 In that day the Lord will extend his hand a second time to recover the remnant of his people who remain—from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
12 He will raise a banner for the nations and will gather the banished of Israel and assemble the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
13 The jealousy of Ephraim will depart, and those who harass Judah will be cut off; Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, and Judah will not harass Ephraim.
14 But they will swoop down on the shoulder of the Philistines to the west; together they will plunder the people of the east. They will stretch out their hand against Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will obey them.
15 And the LORD will utterly destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt, and with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River and strike it into seven streams, and he will make men walk over dry-shod.
16 And there will be a highway from Assyria for the remnant that remains of his people, just as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.




Chapter 12


1 In that day you will say,
“I will give thanks to you, O LORD,
for though you were angry with me,
your anger turned away, and you comforted me.
2 Behold, God is my salvation;
I will trust and will not be afraid,
for the LORD GOD is my strength and my song,
and he has become my salvation.”


3 With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
4 And in that day you will say,
“Give thanks to the LORD; call upon his name;
make known his deeds among the nations;
proclaim that his name is exalted.
5 Sing to the LORD, for he has done glorious things;
let this be known in all the earth.
6 Shout and sing for joy, O inhabitant of Zion,
for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.”




Chapter 13


1 The oracle concerning Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.


2 Raise a banner on a barren hill,
call out to them with a loud voice;
wave the hand that they may enter the gates of the nobles.
3 I myself have commanded my consecrated ones;
I have also summoned my mighty men for my anger,
those who exult in my majesty.


4 The sound of a tumult is on the mountains,
like that of a great multitude.
The sound of an uproar of kingdoms,
of nations gathering together.
The LORD of hosts is mustering an army for war.
5 They come from a distant land,
from the end of the heavens—
the LORD and the weapons of his wrath—
to destroy the whole land.


6 Wail, for the day of the LORD is near;
it will come as destruction from the Almighty.
7 Therefore all hands will hang limp,
and every heart will melt.
8 They will be dismayed;
pangs and agony will seize them;
they will writhe like a woman in labor.
They will look aghast at one another;
their faces will be aflame.


9 Behold, the day of the LORD comes,
cruel, with wrath and fierce anger,
to make the land a desolation
and to destroy its sinners from it.
10 For the stars of the heavens and their constellations
will not give their light;
the sun will be dark at its rising,
and the moon will not shine.


11 I will punish the world for its evil,
and the wicked for their iniquity;
I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud,
and lay low the haughtiness of the ruthless.
12 I will make a man scarcer than fine gold,
a human being rarer than the gold of Ophir.
13 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble,
and the earth will shake out of its place
at the wrath of the LORD of hosts,
in the day of his fierce anger.


14 And like a hunted gazelle,
and like sheep with no one to gather them,
each will turn to his own people,
and each will flee to his own land.
15 Whoever is found will be pierced through,
and whoever is caught will fall by the sword.
16 Their children will be dashed to pieces before their eyes;
their houses will be plundered,
and their wives ravished.


17 Behold, I am stirring up the Medes against them,
who care nothing for silver
and have no delight in gold.
18 Their bows will strike down the young men;
they will show no mercy to the fruit of the womb;
their eyes will not pity children.


19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms,
the splendor and pride of the Chaldeans,
will be like Sodom and Gomorrah
when God overthrew them.
20 It will never again be inhabited
or lived in from generation to generation;
no Arab will pitch his tent there,
no shepherds will make their flocks lie down there.
21 But wild animals will lie down there,
and their houses will be full of howling creatures;
ostriches will dwell there,
and wild goats will leap about.
22 Hyenas will howl in its citadels,
and jackals in its luxurious palaces.
Its time is close at hand,
and its days will not be prolonged.




Chapter 14


1 For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob and will again choose Israel, and will set them in their own land, and sojourners will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob.
2 And the peoples will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them in the LORD’s land as male and female servants. They will take captive those who were their captors, and rule over those who oppressed them.


3 On the day the LORD gives you rest from your pain and turmoil and the hard service with which you were made to serve,
4 you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon:


“How the oppressor has ceased,
the fury has ended!
5 The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked,
the scepter of rulers,
6 that struck the peoples in wrath
with unceasing blows,
that ruled the nations in anger
with relentless persecution.


7 The whole earth is at rest and quiet;
they break forth into singing.
8 Even the cypresses rejoice over you,
and the cedars of Lebanon, saying,
‘Since you were laid low,
no woodcutter comes up against us.’


9 The grave beneath is stirred to meet you when you come;
it rouses the shades to greet you,
all who were leaders of the earth;
it raises from their thrones
all who were kings of the nations.
10 All of them will answer and say to you:
‘You too have become as weak as we!
You have become like us!’
11 Your pomp is brought down to the grave,
the sound of your harps;
maggots are laid as a bed beneath you,
and worms are your covering.


12 How you have fallen from heaven,
O Day Star, son of Dawn!
How you are cut down to the ground,
you who laid the nations low!
13 You said in your heart,
‘I will ascend to heaven;
above the stars of God
I will set my throne on high;
I will sit on the mount of assembly
in the far reaches of the north;
14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
I will make myself like the Most High.’
15 But you are brought down to the grave,
to the far reaches of the pit.
16 Those who see you will stare at you,
they will ponder over you:
‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble,
who shook kingdoms,
17 who made the world like a wilderness
and overthrew its cities,
who did not let his prisoners go home?’


18 All the kings of the nations lie in glory,
each in his own tomb;
19 but you are cast out, away from your grave,
like a loathed branch,
clothed with the slain,
those pierced by the sword,
who go down to the stones of the pit,
like a corpse trampled underfoot.
20 You will not be joined with them in burial,
because you have destroyed your land,
you have killed your people.
May the offspring of evildoers
never be named!
21 Prepare a place of slaughter for his sons
because of the guilt of their fathers,
lest they rise and possess the earth,
and fill the face of the world with cities.


22 I will rise up against them,”
declares the LORD of hosts,
“and will cut off from Babylon name and remnant,
offspring and posterity,” declares the LORD.
23 “And I will make it a possession of the hedgehog,
and pools of water,
and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,”
declares the LORD of hosts.


24 The LORD of hosts has sworn:
“As I have planned, so shall it be,
and as I have purposed, so shall it stand,
25 that I will break the Assyrian in my land,
and on my mountains trample him underfoot;
and his yoke shall depart from them,
and his burden from their shoulder.”


26 This is the plan that is planned
concerning all the earth,
and this is the hand that is stretched out
over all the nations.
27 For the LORD of hosts has purposed,
and who will annul it?
His hand is stretched out,
and who will turn it back?


28 In the year that King Ahaz died came this oracle:


29 Do not rejoice, O Philistia, all of you,
that the rod that struck you is broken,
for from the serpent’s root will come forth an adder,
and its fruit will be a flying fiery serpent.
30 And the firstborn of the poor will graze,
and the needy lie down in safety;
but I will kill your root with famine,
and your remnant it will slay.


31 Wail, O gate; cry out, O city;
melt away, O Philistia, all of you!
For smoke comes out of the north,
and there is no straggler in his ranks.


32 What will one answer the messengers of the nation?
“The LORD has founded Zion,
and in her the afflicted of his people find refuge.”




Chapter 15


1 Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence, and in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence; because the waters of Nimrim are wasted, the grass is dried up, the vegetation fails, and the greenery is no more, the cry on the waters of Nimrim is bitter.
2 The fields of Heshbon languish, the vine of Sibmah also; the joy of Moab is stripped away.


3 I mourn for Moab; his fugitives flee to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah, to the hill country of Luhith, to Horonaim, to the fugitives of Moab.
4 The waters of Dimon are full of blood; I will bring more upon Dimon—lions upon him who escapes from Moab and leopards upon the fugitives—because the hounds of Moab cry, “Go up!”


5 The waters of Nimrim are desolate; the grass is withered; the vegetation fails; the greenery is no more.
6 Therefore the abundance they have gained and stored up they carry away over the brook of the willows.


7 For the fields of Heshbon languish, the vine of Sibmah also; the commanders of the nations have broken the scepters of Moab and cut off its leaders.


8 So the survivors of Moab are at the border; the cry of distress reaches to the brook of the willows.
9 For the waters of Dibon will be full of blood; for I will bring upon Dibon the fugitives of Moab, and the fugitives of Horonaim, a lion; also upon the fugitives of Ar, a lion; and upon the fugitives of Madmenah, a lion; and upon the fugitives of Michmethah, a lion; and upon the fugitives of Kerioth, a lion; and upon the fugitives of Bozrah, a lion.




Chapter 16


1 Send the lamb to the ruler of the land,
from Sela, by way of the desert,
to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.


2 Like fluttering birds, like scattered nestlings,
so are the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon.


3 “Give counsel, grant justice;
make your shade like night in the midst of noonday;
hide the outcasts; do not betray the fugitive.
4 Let the outcasts of Moab sojourn among you;
be a shelter to them from the destroyer.”
When the oppressor is no more, and destruction has ceased,
and he who tramples underfoot has vanished from the land,
5 then a throne will be established in steadfast love,
and on it will sit in faithfulness in the tent of David
one who judges and seeks justice
and is swift to do righteousness.


6 We have heard of the pride of Moab—how proud he is!—
of his arrogance, his pride, and his insolence;
his boasting is empty.
7 Therefore let Moab wail for Moab;
let everyone wail.
Mourn, utterly stricken,
for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth.


8 For the fields of Heshbon languish,
and the vine of Sibmah.
The lords of the nations have struck down its choice branches,
which reached to Jazer and strayed to the desert;
its shoots spread abroad and passed over the sea.
9 Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer
for the vine of Sibmah;
I drench you with my tears,
O Heshbon and Elealeh;
for over your summer fruit and your harvest
the shout has ceased.


10 And joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful field,
and in the vineyards no songs are sung,
no cheers are raised;
no treader treads out wine in the presses;
I have put an end to the shouting.


11 Therefore my inner being moans like a lyre for Moab,
and my heart for Kir-hareseth.
12 And it shall come to pass,
when Moab presents himself,
when he wearies himself on the high place
and comes to his sanctuary to pray,
he will not prevail.


13 This is the word that the LORD spoke concerning Moab in the past.
14 But now the LORD has spoken, saying,
“In three years, like the years of a hired worker,
the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt,
with all his great multitude,
and the remnant will be very small and feeble.”




Chapter 17


1 An oracle concerning Damascus:


Look how Damascus will cease to be a city
and will become a heap of ruins.
2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken;
they will be for flocks, which will lie down,
and none will make them afraid.
3 The fortress will disappear from Ephraim,
and the kingdom from Damascus;
and the remnant of Syria will be
like the glory of the sons of Israel,
declares the LORD of hosts.


4 And in that day the glory of Jacob will be brought low,
and the fat of his flesh will grow lean.
5 And it shall be as when the reaper gathers standing grain,
and his arm harvests the ears,
and as when one gleans the ears of grain
in the Valley of Rephaim.
6 Yet gleanings will be left in it,
as when an olive tree is beaten—
two or three berries in the top of the highest bough,
four or five on the branches of a fruit tree,
declares the LORD, the God of Israel.


7 In that day man will look to his Maker,
and his eyes will look on the Holy One of Israel.
8 He will not look to the altars,
the work of his hands,
and he will not see what his own fingers have made,
either the Asherim or the altars of incense.


9 In that day their strong cities will be
like the deserted places of the wooded heights
and the hilltops,
which they deserted because of the sons of Israel,
and there will be desolation.


10 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation,
and have not remembered the Rock of your refuge;
therefore, though you plant pleasant plants
and sow the vine branch of a stranger,
11 though you make them grow on the day that you plant them,
and make them blossom in the morning that you sow,
yet the harvest will flee away
in a day of grief and incurable pain.


12 Ah, the thunder of many peoples;
they thunder like the thundering of the sea!
Ah, the roar of nations;
they roar like the roaring of mighty waters!
13 The nations roar like the roaring of many waters,
but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far away,
chased like chaff on the mountains before the wind
and whirling dust before the storm.


14 At evening time, see what terror!
Before morning, they are no more!
This is the portion of those who loot us,
and the lot of those who plunder us.




Chapter 18


1 Woe to the land of the whirring wings,
which is beyond the rivers of Cush,
2 which sends ambassadors by the sea,
in vessels of papyrus on the waters.
Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth,
to a people feared near and far,
a nation strong and conquering,
whose land the rivers divide.


3 All you inhabitants of the world,
you who dwell on the earth,
when a signal is raised on the mountains, look!
When a trumpet is blown, listen!


4 For thus the LORD said to me:
“I will quietly look from my dwelling
like clear heat in sunshine,
like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”
5 For before the harvest,
when the blossom is over
and the flower becomes a ripening grape,
he cuts off the shoots with pruning hooks,
and the spreading branches he lops off and clears away.
6 They shall all be left to the birds of prey of the mountains
and to the beasts of the earth.
And the birds of prey will summer on them,
and all the beasts of the earth will winter on them.


7 At that time tribute will be brought to the LORD of hosts
from a people tall and smooth,
from a people feared near and far,
a nation strong and conquering,
whose land the rivers divide,
to Mount Zion, the place of the name of the LORD of hosts.




Chapter 19


1 An oracle concerning Egypt:


Behold, the LORD is riding on a swift cloud
and comes to Egypt;
and the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence,
and the heart of Egypt will melt within it.


2 I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians,
and they will fight, each against his brother
and each against his neighbor,
city against city, kingdom against kingdom;
3 and the spirit of the Egyptians within them will be emptied out,
and I will confound their counsel;
and they will inquire of the idols and the sorcerers,
and of the mediums and the necromancers;
4 and I will give the Egyptians
into the hand of a hard master,
and a fierce king will rule over them,
declares the Lord GOD of hosts.


5 And the waters of the sea will be dried up,
and the river will be dry and parched,
6 and its canals will stink;
the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up;
the reeds and rushes will rot away.
7 The meadows by the Nile, by the mouth of the Nile,
and all sown fields of the Nile will be parched,
will be driven away, and will be no more.
8 The fishermen will mourn and lament,
all who cast a hook in the Nile;
and they will languish who spread nets on the water.
9 The workers in combed flax will be in despair,
and the weavers of white cotton will be confounded.
10 Her pillars will be crushed,
all who work for pay will be grieved in soul.


11 The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish;
the wisest counselors of Pharaoh give stupid counsel.
How can you say to Pharaoh,
“I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings”?
12 Where then are your wise men?
Let them tell you and make known
what the LORD of hosts has purposed against Egypt.
13 The princes of Zoan have become fools,
and the princes of Memphis are deluded;
those who are the cornerstones of her tribes
have led Egypt astray.
14 The LORD has mingled a spirit of confusion within her,
and they will make Egypt stagger in all its deeds,
as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
15 And there will be nothing for Egypt
that head or tail, palm branch or reed, may do.


16 In that day the Egyptians will be like women,
and will tremble with fear before the hand
that the LORD of hosts shakes over them.
17 And the land of Judah will become a terror to the Egyptians;
everyone to whom it is mentioned will fear
because of the purpose that the LORD of hosts
has purposed against them.


18 In that day there will be five cities
in the land of Egypt
that speak the language of Canaan
and swear allegiance to the LORD of hosts.
One of these will be called the City of Destruction.


19 In that day there will be an altar to the LORD
in the midst of the land of Egypt,
and a pillar to the LORD at its border.
20 And it will be a sign and a witness
to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt;
when they cry to the LORD because of oppressors,
he will send them a savior and defender, and deliver them.
21 And the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians,
and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day
and worship with sacrifice and offering,
and they will make vows to the LORD and perform them.
22 And the LORD will strike Egypt, striking and healing,
and they will return to the LORD,
and he will listen to their pleas for mercy and heal them.


23 In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria,
and Assyria will come into Egypt,
and Egypt into Assyria,
and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.


24 In that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria,
a blessing in the midst of the earth,
25 whom the LORD of hosts has blessed, saying,
“Blessed be Egypt my people,
and Assyria the work of my hands,
and Israel my inheritance.”




Chapter 20


1 In the year that the commander-in-chief, who was sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and fought against it and captured it—
2 at that time the LORD spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and loosen the sackcloth from your waist and take off your sandals from your feet,” and he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
3 Then the LORD said, “Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Cush,
4 so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, both the young and the old, naked and barefoot, with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
5 Then they will be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and of Egypt their boast.
6 And the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, Look! This is what has happened to those in whom we hoped and to whom we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria! And we—how shall we escape?’”




Chapter 21


1 The oracle concerning the wilderness of the sea:


As whirlwinds in the Negev sweep on,
it comes from the wilderness, from a terrible land.
2 A harsh vision has been told to me;
the traitor betrays, and the destroyer destroys.
Go up, O Elam; lay siege, O Media;
all the sighing she has caused I bring to an end.


3 Therefore my loins are filled with anguish;
pangs have seized me,
like the pangs of a woman in labor;
I am bowed down so that I cannot hear;
I am dismayed so that I cannot see.
4 My heart staggers; horror terrifies me;
the twilight I longed for
has been turned for me into trembling.


5 They prepare the table,
they spread the rugs,
they eat, they drink.
Arise, O princes; oil the shield!


6 For thus the Lord said to me:
“Go, set a watchman;
let him announce what he sees.
7 When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs,
riders on donkeys, riders on camels,
let him listen diligently,
very diligently.”


8 Then he who saw cried out:
“Upon a watchtower I stand, O Lord, continually by day,
and at my post I am stationed
whole nights.
9 And behold, here come riders,
horsemen in pairs!”
And he answered,
“Fallen, fallen is Babylon;
and all the carved images of her gods
he has shattered to the ground.”


10 O my threshed and winnowed one,
what I have heard from the LORD of hosts,
the God of Israel, I announce to you.


11 The oracle concerning Dumah:


One is calling to me from Seir,
“Watchman, what of the night?
Watchman, what of the night?”
12 The watchman says:
“Morning comes, and also the night.
If you will inquire, inquire;
come back again.”


13 The oracle concerning Arabia:


In the thickets in Arabia you will lodge,
O caravans of Dedanites.
14 To the thirsty bring water;
meet the fugitive with bread,
O inhabitants of the land of Tema.
15 For they have fled from the swords,
from the drawn sword,
from the bent bow,
and from the press of battle.


16 For thus the Lord said to me, “Within a year,
according to the years of a hired worker,
all the glory of Kedar will come to an end.
17 And the remainder of the archers of the mighty men of the sons of Kedar will be few,
for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.”




Chapter 22


1 The oracle concerning the valley of vision:


What is the matter with you now,
that you have all gone up to the housetops,
2 you who are full of noise,
a tumultuous city,
a joyous town?
Your slain are not slain with the sword
nor dead in battle.
3 All your leaders have fled together;
without the bow they were captured.
All of you who were found were captured,
though they had fled far away.


4 Therefore I said,
“Look away from me;
let me weep bitterly;
do not labor to comfort me
concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people.”


5 For the Lord GOD of hosts has a day
of tumult and trampling and confusion
in the valley of vision,
a breaking down of walls
and a crying out to the mountains.
6 And Elam bore the quiver
with chariots and horsemen,
and Kir uncovered the shield.
7 And your choicest valleys were full of chariots,
and the horsemen took their stand at the gates.


8 He removed the covering of Judah.
In that day you looked to the weapons of the House of the Forest,
9 and you saw that the breaches of the city of David were many,
and you collected the waters of the lower pool.
10 And you counted the houses of Jerusalem,
and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.
11 You made a reservoir between the two walls
for the water of the old pool.
But you did not look to him who did it,
or see him who planned it long ago.


12 In that day the Lord GOD of hosts
called for weeping and mourning,
for baldness and wearing sackcloth;
13 but behold, joy and gladness,
killing oxen and slaughtering sheep,
eating flesh and drinking wine.
“Let us eat and drink,
for tomorrow we die.”


14 The LORD of hosts has revealed himself in my ears:
“Surely this iniquity will not be atoned for you until you die,”
says the Lord GOD of hosts.


15 Thus says the Lord GOD of hosts,
“Come, go to this steward, to Shebna,
who is over the household, and say to him:
16 What have you here, and whom have you here,
that you have cut out here a tomb for yourself,
you who cut out a tomb on the height
and carve a dwelling for yourself in the rock?
17 Behold, the LORD will hurl you away violently,
O strong man.
He will seize firm hold on you
18 and whirl you around and around,
and throw you like a ball into a wide land.
There you shall die,
and there shall be your splendid chariots,
you shame of your master’s house.
19 I will thrust you from your office,
and you will be pulled down from your station.


20 In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
21 and I will clothe him with your robe,
and will bind your sash on him,
and will commit your authority to his hand.
And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
and to the house of Judah.
22 And I will place on his shoulder
the key of the house of David.
He shall open, and none shall shut;
and he shall shut, and none shall open.
23 And I will fasten him like a peg in a secure place,
and he will become a throne of honor to his father’s house.
24 And they will hang on him the whole honor of his father’s house,
the offspring and the issue, every small vessel,
from the cups to all the flagons.


25 In that day, declares the LORD of hosts,
the peg that was fastened in a secure place will give way,
and it will be cut down and fall,
and the load that was on it will be cut off,
for the LORD has spoken.




Chapter 23


1 An oracle concerning Tyre:


Wail, O ships of Tarshish,
for Tyre is laid waste, without house or harbor.
From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.


2 Be still, O inhabitants of the coastland,
you merchants of Sidon;
your messengers crossed the sea
3 and were on many waters.
The grain of the Nile, the harvest of the River,
was her revenue,
and she became the marketplace of nations.


4 Be ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea speaks,
the stronghold of the sea, saying:
“I have not been in labor nor given birth;
I have not reared young men
or brought up virgins.”


5 When the report comes to Egypt,
they will writhe in anguish at the report about Tyre.


6 Cross over to Tarshish;
wail, O inhabitants of the coastland.
7 Is this your exultant city,
whose origin is from days of old,
whose feet carried her to settle far away?


8 Who has purposed this
against Tyre, the bestower of crowns,
whose merchants were princes,
whose traders were the honored of the earth?


9 The LORD of hosts has purposed it,
to defile the pride of all glory,
to dishonor all the honored of the earth.
10 Overflow your land like the Nile,
O daughter of Tarshish;
there is no longer a harbor.


11 He has stretched out His hand over the sea,
He has shaken kingdoms;
the LORD has given a command concerning Canaan
to destroy its strongholds.
12 And He said,
“You shall no more exult,
O oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon.
Arise, cross over to Kittim;
even there you will find no rest.”


13 Behold the land of the Chaldeans—
this is the people that was not;
Assyria appointed it for desert creatures—
they raised up their siege towers,
they stripped its citadels bare,
they made it a ruin.


14 Wail, O ships of Tarshish,
for your stronghold is laid waste.


15 In that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years,
like the days of one king.
At the end of seventy years,
it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:


16 “Take a harp,
go about the city,
O forgotten prostitute;
make sweet melody,
sing many songs,
that you may be remembered.”


17 At the end of seventy years, the LORD will visit Tyre,
and she will return to her wages
and will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms of the earth
on the face of the ground.
18 Yet her merchandise and her wages
will be holy to the LORD.
It will not be stored or hoarded,
but her merchandise will supply abundant food and fine clothing
for those who dwell before the LORD.




Chapter 24


1 Behold, the LORD is about to lay waste the earth and devastate it;
He will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants.
2 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest;
as with the servant, so with his master;
as with the maid, so with her mistress;
as with the buyer, so with the seller;
as with the lender, so with the borrower;
as with the creditor, so with the debtor.


3 The earth shall be utterly laid waste and completely plundered,
for the LORD has spoken this word.


4 The earth mourns and withers;
the world languishes and withers;
the exalted of the earth languish.
5 The earth is defiled under its inhabitants,
for they have transgressed the laws,
violated the statutes,
broken the everlasting covenant.
6 Therefore a curse has devoured the earth,
and those who dwell in it bear the guilt;
therefore the inhabitants of the earth are scorched,
and few men are left.


7 The new wine mourns, the vine withers,
and all the joyful of heart now sigh.
8 The mirth of tambourines is stilled,
the noise of revelers has ceased,
the celebration of the lyre is stopped.
9 They shall not drink wine with song;
strong drink shall be bitter to those who drink it.
10 The city of chaos is broken down;
every house is shut up, that no one may enter.
11 There is an outcry in the streets for wine;
all joy has grown dark;
the mirth of the earth is banished.
12 Desolation is left in the city,
and the gate is battered to ruins.


13 For thus it shall be in the midst of the earth
among the nations,
as when an olive tree is beaten,
as at the gleaning when the grape harvest is done.


14 They lift up their voices, they sing for joy;
over the majesty of the LORD they shout from the west.
15 Therefore glorify the LORD in the east,
the name of the LORD, the God of Israel,
in the coastlands of the sea.
16 From the ends of the earth we hear songs:
“Glory to the Righteous One!”


But I say, “I waste away! I waste away! Woe is me!
For traitors have betrayed,
with betrayal the traitors have betrayed.”


17 Terror and pit and snare await you,
O inhabitant of the earth.
18 He who flees at the sound of the terror
shall fall into the pit,
and he who climbs out of the pit
shall be caught in the snare.
For the windows of heaven are opened,
and the foundations of the earth quake.


19 The earth is utterly broken,
the earth is split apart,
the earth is violently shaken.
20 The earth staggers like a drunkard,
it sways like a hut;
its transgression lies heavy upon it,
and it falls, never to rise again.


21 In that day the LORD will punish
the host of heaven in heaven,
and the kings of the earth on the earth.
22 They will be gathered together
as prisoners in a pit;
they will be shut up in a dungeon,
and after many days they will be punished.


23 Then the moon will be confounded
and the sun ashamed,
for the LORD of hosts will reign
on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
and before His elders will be glory.




Chapter 25


1 O LORD, You are my God;
I will exalt You, I will praise Your name,
for You have done wonderful things—
plans formed of old, faithful and true.
2 For You have made the city a heap,
the fortified city a ruin;
the citadel of foreigners is no longer a city;
it will never be rebuilt.
3 Therefore strong peoples will glorify You;
cities of ruthless nations will fear You.
4 For You have been a stronghold to the poor,
a stronghold to the needy in his distress,
a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat;
for the breath of the ruthless
is like a storm against a wall,
5 like heat in a dry place.
You subdue the noise of foreigners;
as heat is reduced by the shade of a cloud,
so the song of the ruthless is silenced.


6 On this mountain the LORD of hosts
will prepare for all peoples
a feast of rich food,
a feast of well-aged wine,
rich food full of marrow,
aged wine well refined.
7 And He will destroy on this mountain
the covering that is cast over all peoples,
the veil that is spread over all nations.
8 He will swallow up death forever,
and the Lord GOD will wipe away
tears from all faces,
and the reproach of His people
He will take away from all the earth,
for the LORD has spoken.


9 It will be said on that day,
“Behold, this is our God;
we have waited for Him, that He might save us.
This is the LORD; we have waited for Him.
Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.”
10 For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain,
and Moab shall be trampled down in his place,
as straw is trampled down in a dung pit.
11 And he will spread out his hands in its midst
as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim,
but the LORD will bring down his pride
together with the skill of his hands.
12 And the high fortifications of his walls
He will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground,
to the dust.




Chapter 26


1 In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
“We have a strong city;
He sets up salvation
as walls and ramparts.
2 Open the gates,
that the righteous nation may enter—
the one that keeps faith.


3 You will keep in perfect peace
the mind that is stayed on You,
because he trusts in You.
4 Trust in the LORD forever,
for the LORD GOD is an everlasting rock.
5 For He has brought low
those who dwell on high,
the lofty city He lays low.
He lays it low, to the ground;
He casts it down to the dust.
6 The foot tramples it,
the feet of the afflicted,
the steps of the poor.”


7 The path of the righteous is level;
You make straight the way of the upright.
8 Indeed, in the path of Your judgments, O LORD,
we have waited for You.
Your name and the memory of You
are the desire of our soul.
9 My soul longs for You in the night;
indeed, my spirit within me seeks You earnestly.
For when Your judgments are in the earth,
the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.


10 If grace is shown to the wicked,
he does not learn righteousness;
in the land of uprightness he deals perversely
and does not see the majesty of the LORD.
11 O LORD, Your hand is lifted up,
but they do not see it.
Let them see Your zeal for the people and be ashamed;
yes, let the fire reserved for Your enemies consume them.
12 LORD, You will establish peace for us,
for You have indeed done for us
all our works.


13 O LORD our God,
other masters besides You have ruled over us,
but we remember Your name alone.
14 They are dead, they will not live;
they are shades, they will not rise.
To that end You visited them with destruction
and wiped out all remembrance of them.


15 You have increased the nation, O LORD,
You have increased the nation; You are glorified;
You have enlarged all the borders of the land.
16 O LORD, in distress they sought You;
they poured out a whispered prayer
when Your discipline was upon them.


17 Like a pregnant woman
who writhes and cries out in her pain
when she is about to give birth,
so were we before You, O LORD.
18 We were pregnant, we writhed,
but we gave birth to wind.
We have accomplished no deliverance in the earth,
and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.


19 Your dead shall live;
their bodies shall rise.
You who dwell in the dust, awake and shout for joy!
For Your dew is a dew of light,
and the earth will give birth to the dead.


20 Come, my people,
enter your chambers,
and shut your doors behind you;
hide yourselves for a little while
until the wrath has passed by.
21 For you can see the LORD coming out from His place
to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity,
and the earth will disclose the blood shed on it,
and will no more cover its slain.


Chapter 27


1 In that day the LORD, with His fierce and great and mighty sword,
will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent,
Leviathan the twisting serpent,
and He will slay the dragon that is in the sea.


2 In that day sing of her:
“A vineyard of delight.
3 I, the LORD, am its keeper;
I water it every moment.
Lest anyone harm it,
I guard it night and day.


4 I have no wrath.
Should someone give Me thorns and briers in battle,
I would march against them;
I would burn them together.
5 Or let him take hold of My strength,
that he may make peace with Me;
let him make peace with Me.”


6 In days to come Jacob will take root;
Israel will blossom and sprout,
and they will fill the face of the world with fruit.


7 Has He struck them as He struck those who struck them?
Or have they been slain as their slayers were slain?
8 You contended with them by driving them away,
by sending them off with His fierce wind
in the day of the east wind.


9 Therefore by this Jacob’s guilt will be atoned for,
and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin:
when he makes all the stones of the altar
like chalkstones crushed to pieces,
no Asherim or incense altars will remain standing.


10 For the fortified city is solitary,
a habitation forsaken and abandoned like the wilderness;
there the calf will graze,
and there it will lie down
and consume its branches.
11 When its boughs are dry, they are broken;
women come and set them on fire.
For this is a people without understanding;
therefore He who made them will not have compassion on them,
and He who formed them will show them no favor.


12 And it will be in that day
that the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates River
to the brook of Egypt,
and you will be gathered one by one,
O sons of Israel.


13 And it will be in that day
that a great trumpet will be blown,
and those who were perishing in the land of Assyria
and the outcasts in the land of Egypt will come,
and they will worship the LORD
on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.




Chapter 28


1 Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim,
and to the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
which is on the head of the fertile valley
of those overcome with wine.


2 See, the LORD has one who is strong and mighty,
like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest,
like a storm of mighty overflowing waters;
He will cast it down to the earth with His hand.


3 The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim
will be trampled underfoot.
4 And the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
which is on the head of the fertile valley,
will be like the first-ripe fig before the summer;
when one sees it, while it is still in his hand,
he swallows it.


5 In that day the LORD of hosts will be
a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty
for the remnant of His people,
6 and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,
and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.


7 But these also reel with wine
and stagger with strong drink;
the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink,
they are swallowed by wine,
they stagger with strong drink;
they reel in vision,
they stumble in judgment.
8 For all the tables are full of vomit,
without a clean place.


9 “To whom will He teach knowledge?
And to whom will He explain the message?
To those just weaned from milk?
To those just taken from the breast?


10 For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept,
line upon line, line upon line,
here a little, there a little.”
11 For with stammering lips
and in a foreign language
He will speak to this people,
12 to whom He said,
“This is the rest; give rest to the weary,”
and, “This is the repose,”
yet they would not hear.


13 So the word of the LORD will be to them,
“Precept upon precept, precept upon precept,
line upon line, line upon line,
here a little, there a little,”
that they may go and stumble backward,
be broken, snared, and taken.


14 Therefore hear the word of the LORD,
you scoffers,
who rule this people in Jerusalem.


15 Because you have said,
“We have made a covenant with death,
and with the grave we have an agreement;
when the overwhelming scourge passes through,
it will not come to us,
for we have made lies our refuge,
and in falsehood we have hidden ourselves.”


16 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD,
“See, I am laying in Zion a stone,
a tested stone,
a precious cornerstone,
of a sure foundation;
whoever believes will not be in haste.
17 And I will make justice the measuring line
and righteousness the plumb line;
hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,
and waters will overflow the hiding place.
18 And your covenant with death will be annulled,
and your agreement with the grave will not stand;
when the overwhelming scourge passes through,
you will be beaten down by it.
19 As often as it passes through, it will take you;
morning after morning it will pass through,
by day and by night;
and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.”
20 For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on,
and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in.


21 For the LORD will rise up as at Mount Perazim,
He will be stirred up as in the valley of Gibeon,
to do His work—His strange work—
and to perform His task—His unusual task.
22 And now do not scoff, lest your bonds be made strong;
for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts
a decree of destruction upon the whole land.
23 Give ear, and hear my voice;
listen, and hear my speech.


24 Does the plowman plow all day to sow?
Does he continually open and harrow his ground?
25 When he has leveled its surface,
does he not scatter dill and sow cumin,
and put wheat in rows
and barley in its place,
and spelt as its border?
26 For his God instructs him in right judgment
and teaches him.
27 For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge,
nor is a cart wheel rolled over cumin;
but dill is beaten out with a staff,
and cumin with a rod.
28 Grain is crushed for bread,
but he does not thresh it endlessly;
though he drives the cart wheel and his horses over it,
he does not crush it to powder.


29 This also comes from the LORD of hosts,
who is wonderful in counsel
and excellent in wisdom.




Chapter 29


1 Woe to Ariel, Ariel,
the city where David encamped!
Add year to year;
let the cycle of festivals go round.
2 Then I will bring distress upon Ariel,
and there will be mourning and lamentation,
and she will be to Me
like an altar hearth.
3 I will encamp against you all around;
I will lay siege against you with towers,
and I will raise up siegeworks against you.
4 Then you will be brought low;
from the ground you will speak,
and from the dust your words will be subdued;
your voice will be like that of a spirit from the ground,
and from the dust your speech will whisper.


5 But the multitude of your foes
will become like fine dust,
and the multitude of the ruthless
like chaff that blows away;
and it will happen suddenly,
in an instant.
6 From the LORD of hosts you will be visited
with thunder, earthquake, and great noise,
with whirlwind and tempest,
and the flame of a consuming fire.
7 And the multitude of all the nations
who wage war against Ariel,
even all who fight against her and her stronghold
and who distress her,
will be like a dream,
a vision of the night.


8 And it will be as when a hungry man dreams—
look, he is eating,
but he wakes, and his appetite is empty;
or as when a thirsty man dreams—
look, he is drinking,
but he wakes, and behold, he is faint,
and his craving is not satisfied.
So will it be with the multitude
of all the nations who wage war against Mount Zion.


9 Be stunned and be amazed!
Blind yourselves and be blind!
They are drunk, but not from wine;
they stagger, but not from strong drink.
10 For the LORD has poured over you
a spirit of deep sleep,
and He has shut your eyes—
the prophets;
and He has covered your heads—
the seers.
11 And the vision of all this has become to you
like the words of a sealed scroll,
which men give to one who knows how to read, saying,
“Read this, please,”
but he says, “I cannot, for it is sealed.”
12 Or the scroll is given to one
who does not know how to read, saying,
“Read this, please,”
but he says, “I do not know how to read.”


13 Then the Lord said,
“Because this people draws near with its mouth
and honors Me with its lips,
but its heart is far from Me,
and their fear of Me is a commandment taught by men,
14 therefore, see how I will again do extraordinary things
with this people,
wonderful and marvelous;
and the wisdom of their wise men will perish,
and the understanding of their discerning men will be hidden.”


15 Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from the LORD,
and whose deeds are done in darkness,
and who say, “Who sees us?”
and “Who knows us?”


16 You turn things upside down!
Shall the potter be regarded as the clay,
so that the thing made should say of its maker,
“He did not make me,”
or the thing formed say of the one who formed it,
“He has no understanding”?


17 Is it not yet a very little while
until Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field,
and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest?
18 In that day the deaf will hear
the words of a scroll,
and out of the gloom and darkness
the eyes of the blind will see.
19 The humble will increase their joy in the LORD,
and the needy among men will rejoice
in the Holy One of Israel.
20 For the ruthless will come to nothing,
and the scoffer will cease,
and all who watch for iniquity will be cut off,
21 those who condemn a man by a word,
who ensnare the one who reproves in the gate,
and who turn aside the righteous
with an empty claim.


22 Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham,
concerning the house of Jacob:
“Jacob will no longer be ashamed,
nor will his face grow pale.
23 For when he sees his children,
the work of My hands, in his midst,
they will sanctify My name;
they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob
and stand in awe of the God of Israel.
24 Those who err in spirit will come to understanding,
and those who murmur will accept instruction.”




Chapter 30


1 “Woe to the rebellious sons,” declares the LORD,
who carry out a plan, but not from Me,
and who weave an alliance, but not of My Spirit,
in order to heap sin upon sin—
2 those who set out to go down to Egypt,
without consulting My mouth,
to take refuge in the stronghold of Pharaoh,
and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt.
3 But the stronghold of Pharaoh will become your shame,
and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt your humiliation.
4 For his princes are at Zoan,
and his envoys reach Hanes.
5 They will all be ashamed because of a people who cannot profit them,
who are not for help and not for profit,
but for shame and also for reproach.


6 The oracle concerning the beasts of the Negev:
Through a land of distress and anguish,
from where come lioness and lion,
viper and flying serpent,
they carry their wealth on the backs of donkeys,
and their treasures on the humps of camels,
to a people who cannot profit by them—
7 for Egypt’s help is vanity and emptiness.
Therefore I call her, “Rahab—They sit still.”


8 Now go, write it before them on a tablet,
and inscribe it in a book,
that it may be for the time to come,
forever and ever.
9 For this is a rebellious people,
lying sons,
sons who are unwilling to listen to the instruction of the LORD—
10 who say to the seers, “You must not see,”
and to the prophets, “You must not prophesy to us what is right.
Speak to us pleasant things,
prophesy illusions.
11 Get out of the way,
turn aside from the path,
cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.”


12 Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel:
“Because you despise this word,
and trust in oppression and perversity,
and lean on it,
13 therefore this iniquity will be for you
like a breach about to fall,
a bulge in a high wall,
whose breaking comes suddenly, in an instant.
14 And its breaking is like the breaking of a potter’s jar,
smashed ruthlessly,
so that not a shard is found among its fragments
with which to take fire from a hearth
or to scoop water from a cistern.”


15 For thus says the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel:
“In returning and rest you will be saved;
in quietness and trust will be your strength.”
But you were unwilling,
16 and you said, “No,
for we will flee on horses”—
therefore you shall flee.
“And on swift ones we will ride”—
therefore your pursuers will be swift.
17 One thousand will flee at the rebuke of one;
at the rebuke of five you will flee,
until you are left like a pole on the top of a mountain,
and like a signal on a hill.


18 Therefore the LORD waits to be gracious to you,
and therefore He rises to have compassion on you.
For the LORD is a God of justice;
blessed are all who wait for Him.


19 For, O people in Zion, who dwell in Jerusalem,
you will weep no more.
He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry;
when He hears it, He will answer you.
20 Though the Lord give you bread of distress and water of oppression,
yet your Teacher will no longer hide Himself,
but your eyes will see your Teacher.
21 And your ears will hear a word behind you, saying,
“This is the way; walk in it,”
when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left.
22 Then you will defile your graven images overlaid with silver,
and your molten images plated with gold.
You will scatter them as an impure thing,
you will say to them, “Be gone!”


23 Then He will give rain for your seed,
with which you sow the ground,
and bread, the produce of the ground,
and it will be rich and plenteous.
In that day your livestock will graze in broad pastures.
24 And the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground
will eat seasoned fodder,
which has been winnowed with shovel and fork.
25 And on every lofty mountain
and on every high hill
there will be streams running with water,
on the day of the great slaughter,
when the towers fall.


26 And the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun,
and the light of the sun will be sevenfold,
like the light of seven days,
on the day when the LORD binds up the fracture of His people
and heals the wound of their blow.


27 See how the name of the LORD comes from afar,
burning with His anger and in thick rising smoke;
His lips are full of indignation,
and His tongue is like a devouring fire.
28 His breath is like an overflowing torrent,
that reaches up to the neck,
to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction,
and to place the bridle of error in the jaws of the peoples.
29 You will have a song as in the night when a festival is kept,
and gladness of heart as when one goes with the flute
to come to the mountain of the LORD,
to the Rock of Israel.


30 And the LORD will cause the splendor of His voice to be heard,
and the descending of His arm to be seen,
with fierce anger and flame of devouring fire,
with cloudburst, downpour, and hailstones.
31 For at the voice of the LORD Assyria will be shattered;
with His rod He will strike.
32 And every stroke of the staff of punishment
that the LORD will bring down on him
will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres;
and in battles brandished with weapons He will fight against them.
33 For Topheth has long been prepared;
indeed, it has been made ready for the king.
He has made it deep and wide,
its pile of fire and wood in abundance;
the breath of the LORD, like a torrent of brimstone,
sets it ablaze.




Chapter 31


1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help
and rely on horses,
who trust in chariots because they are many
and in horsemen because they are very strong,
but do not look to the Holy One of Israel
or consult the LORD!
2 And yet he is wise and brings disaster;
he does not call back his words,
but will arise against the house of the evildoers
and against the helpers of those who work iniquity.


3 The Egyptians are man, and not God,
and their horses are flesh, and not spirit.
When the LORD stretches out his hand,
the helper will stumble,
and he who is helped will fall,
and they will all perish together.
4 For thus the LORD said to me,
“As a lion or a young lion growls over his prey,
and when a band of shepherds is called out against him
he is not terrified by their shouting
or daunted at their noise,
so the LORD of hosts will come down
to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill.
5 Like birds hovering, so the LORD of hosts
will protect Jerusalem;
he will protect and deliver it;
he will spare and rescue it.”


6 Turn to him from whom people have deeply revolted,
O children of Israel.
7 For in that day everyone shall cast away
his idols of silver and his idols of gold,
which your hands have sinfully made for you.
8 “And the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of man;
and a sword, not of man, shall devour him;
and he shall flee from the sword,
and his young men shall be put to forced labor.
9 His rock shall pass away in terror,
and his officers desert the standard in panic,”
declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion,
and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.




Chapter 32


1 Behold, a king will reign in righteousness,
and princes will rule with justice.
2 And a man will be like a hiding place from the wind,
a shelter from the storm,
like streams of water in a dry place,
like the shade of a great rock in a weary land.


3 Then the eyes of those who see will not be dim,
and the ears of those who hear will listen.
4 The heart of the hasty will understand and know,
and the tongue of the stammerers will speak clearly and plainly.
5 The fool will no longer be called noble,
nor the scoundrel said to be honorable.
6 For the fool speaks folly,
and his heart works iniquity,
to practice ungodliness
and to utter error concerning the LORD,
to leave the hungry soul empty
and to deprive the thirsty of drink.


7 The scoundrel’s devices are evil;
he plans wicked schemes
to ruin the poor with lying words,
even when the plea of the needy is just.
8 But the noble plans noble things,
and on noble things he stands.
9 Rise up, you women who are at ease;
hear my voice,
you complacent daughters,
give ear to my speech.
10 In little more than a year
you will shudder, you complacent women;
for the grape harvest fails,
the fruit harvest will not come.
11 Tremble, you women who are at ease;
shudder, you complacent ones;
strip, and make yourselves bare,
and put sackcloth on your waist.
12 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields,
for the fruitful vine,
13 for the soil of my people
growing up in thorns and briers,
yes, for all the houses of joy
in the jubilant city.


14 For the palace is forsaken,
the populous city abandoned;
the hill and the watchtower
will become dens forever,
a joy of wild donkeys,
a pasture of flocks,
15 until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high,
and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,
and the fruitful field is considered a forest.
16 Then justice will dwell in the wilderness,
and righteousness abide in the fruitful field.
17 And the work of righteousness will be peace,
and the result of righteousness,
quietness and trust forever.


18 My people will dwell in a peaceful habitation,
in secure dwellings,
and in undisturbed resting places,
19 though it hails when the forest falls down,
and the city will be utterly laid low.
20 Blessed are you who sow beside all waters,
who let the feet of the ox and the donkey range free.




Chapter 33


1 Woe to you destroyer,
who yourself have not been destroyed,
and you treacherous one,
who have not been dealt treacherously with!
When you finish destroying, you will be destroyed;
when you finish dealing treacherously, they will deal treacherously with you.


2 LORD, be gracious to us; we wait for You.
Be our arm every morning,
our salvation also in the time of distress.
3 At the sound of the tumult the peoples flee;
at the lifting up of Yourself the nations scatter.
4 Your spoil will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers;
as locusts leap, so they leap upon it.
5 The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high;
He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
6 He will be the stability of your times,
a wealth of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge;
the fear of the LORD is His treasure.


7 Behold, their brave men cry outside;
the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
8 The highways are deserted,
the traveler has ceased.
He has broken the covenant,
despised the cities;
He regards no man.
9 The land mourns and languishes;
Lebanon is shamed and withers away.
Sharon is like a wilderness,
and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.


10 “Now I will arise,” says the LORD,
“Now I will be exalted; now I will lift Myself up.
11 You conceive chaff, you will give birth to stubble;
My breath is a fire that will consume you.
12 The peoples will be burned to lime;
like cut thorns they are set ablaze in the fire.
13 Hear, you who are far off, what I have done;
and you who are near, acknowledge My might.”


14 The sinners in Zion are terrified;
trembling has seized the godless:
“Who among us can dwell with the consuming fire?
Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?”
15 He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly,
who rejects gain from extortion,
who shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe,
who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed
and shuts his eyes from looking on evil—
16 He will dwell on the heights;
his refuge will be the impregnable cliffs;
his bread will be given him,
his water will be sure.
17 Your eyes will see the King in His beauty;
they will behold a land that stretches afar.
18 Your heart will meditate on terror:
“Where is he who counts?
Where is he who weighs?
Where is he who counts the towers?”


19 You will see no more the fierce people,
a people of obscure speech that you cannot comprehend,
of a stammering tongue that you cannot understand.
20 Behold Zion, the city of our appointed feasts;
your eyes will see Jerusalem,
an undisturbed habitation,
a tent that will not be moved;
its stakes will never be pulled up,
nor any of its cords torn apart.
21 But there the Majestic One, the LORD, will be for us
a place of rivers, wide canals
on which no galley with oars will go,
and no mighty ship will pass.
22 For the LORD is our judge,
the LORD is our lawgiver,
the LORD is our king;
He will save us.


23 Your tackle hangs slack;
it cannot hold the base of its mast firmly,
nor spread out the sail.
Then an abundance of spoil will be divided;
even the lame will take the plunder.
24 And no inhabitant will say, “I am sick”;
the people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity.




Chapter 34


1 Draw near, O nations, to hear,
and give heed, O peoples!
Let the earth hear, and all that is in it,
the world, and all that it brings forth.
2 For the LORD’s indignation is against all the nations,
and His wrath against all their armies;
He has devoted them to destruction,
He has given them over to slaughter.
3 Their slain shall be cast out,
and the stench of their corpses shall rise;
the mountains shall be drenched with their blood.
4 All the host of heaven shall rot away,
and the skies shall be rolled up like a scroll;
all their host shall wither,
as a leaf withers from the vine,
or as fruit withers from the fig tree.
5 For My sword has drunk its fill in heaven;
behold, it shall descend in judgment upon Edom,
upon the people I have devoted to destruction.
6 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood;
it is gorged with fat—
with the blood of lambs and goats,
with the fat of the kidneys of rams.
For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah,
and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
7 Wild oxen shall fall with them,
and young bulls with the mighty steers;
their land shall drink its fill of blood,
and their soil shall be gorged with fat.
8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance,
a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.


9 Her streams shall be turned into pitch,
and her soil into sulfur;
her land shall become burning pitch.
10 Night and day it shall not be quenched;
its smoke shall go up forever.
From generation to generation it shall lie waste;
none shall pass through it forever and ever.
11 But the pelican and the hedgehog shall possess it,
and the owl and the raven shall dwell in it.
He shall stretch over it the line of confusion
and the plumb line of emptiness.
12 Its nobles—there is no one there to call it a kingdom—
and all its princes shall be nothing.
13 Thorns shall grow over its strongholds,
nettles and thistles in its fortresses;
it shall be the haunt of jackals,
an abode for ostriches.
14 And wild animals shall meet with hyenas,
the goat shall call to his fellow;
indeed, there the night creature shall settle,
and find herself a resting place.
15 There the owl shall nest and lay eggs,
and hatch them and gather her young in her shadow;
indeed, there the hawks shall be gathered,
each with her mate.


16 Seek from the book of the LORD and read:
Not one of these shall be missing;
none shall lack her mate.
For His mouth has commanded it,
and His Spirit has gathered them.
17 He has cast the lot for them,
and His hand has divided it to them by line;
they shall possess it forever;
from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.




Chapter 35


1 The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad,
and the desert shall rejoice and blossom like the crocus.
2 It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice with joy and singing;
the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it,
the majesty of Carmel and Sharon.
They shall see the glory of the LORD,
the majesty of our God.


3 Strengthen the weak hands,
and make firm the feeble knees.
4 Say to those who have an anxious heart,
“Be strong; do not fear!
Behold, your God will come with vengeance,
with the recompense of God.
He will come and save you.”


5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,
and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
6 Then shall the lame leap like a deer,
and the tongue of the mute shall sing for joy.
For waters shall break forth in the wilderness,
and streams in the desert.
7 The burning sand shall become a pool,
and the thirsty ground springs of water;
in the haunt of jackals, where they lie down,
the grass shall become reeds and rushes.


8 And a highway shall be there,
and it shall be called the Way of Holiness;
the unclean shall not pass over it.
It shall belong to those who walk the way;
fools shall not stray upon it.
9 No lion shall be there,
nor shall any ravenous beast go up on it;
they shall not be found there,
but the redeemed shall walk there.
10 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return,
and come to Zion with singing;
everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;
they shall obtain gladness and joy,
and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.




Chapter 36


1 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
2 And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem with a large army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway to the Washer’s Field.


3 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him.
4 And the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you base this confidence of yours?
5 You say you have counsel and strength for war, but they are only words on the lips. On whom do you now rely, that you have rebelled against me?
6 Look, you are relying on Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him.
7 But if you say to me, “We rely on the LORD our God,” is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, “You shall worship before this altar”?


8 Now, come, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
9 How then can you turn back a single captain among the least of my master’s servants, when you are relying on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
10 Moreover, is it without the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it.”’”


11 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”
12 But the Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”


13 Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
14 Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.
15 Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD by saying, “The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”’
16 Do not listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make your peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat from his own vine, and each from his own fig tree, and each will drink water from his own cistern,
17 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
18 Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying, “The LORD will deliver us.” Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?


19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
20 Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”


21 But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king’s command was, “Do not answer him.”
22 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.




Chapter 37


1 And when King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
3 And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace; for children have come to the point of birth, but there is no strength to bring them forth.
4 Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.


5 So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
6 And Isaiah said to them, "Thus you shall say to your master: 'Thus says the LORD, Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
7 Watch how I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a report and return to his own land, and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.'"


8 So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
9 And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, "He has come out to fight against you." And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
10 "Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
11 Although you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, devoting them to destruction, shall you also be delivered?
12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my fathers destroyed—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?
13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?'"


14 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD.
15 And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying,
16 "O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
17 Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.
18 Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,
19 and have cast their gods into the fire—for they were not gods but the work of men's hands, wood and stone—therefore they were destroyed.
20 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the LORD."


21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: 'Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
22 this is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him:
"The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you;
the daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you.
23 Whom have you mocked and blasphemed?
Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes on high?
Against the Holy One of Israel!
24 By your servants you have mocked the Lord, and you have said,
'With my many chariots I have gone up the heights of the mountains, to the remotest parts of Lebanon;
I cut down its tall cedars, its choicest cypresses;
I entered its farthest lodging place, its most fruitful forest.
25 I dug wells and drank foreign waters,
and with the sole of my foot I dried up all the streams of Egypt.'


26 Have you not heard
that I determined it long ago?
I planned it from days of old,
what now I bring to pass,
that you should make fortified cities crash into heaps of ruins,
27 while their inhabitants, shorn of strength, are dismayed and confounded,
and have become like plants of the field, like tender grass,
like grass on the housetops, blighted before it is grown.


28 But I know your sitting down and your going out and coming in,
and your raging against me.
29 Because you have raged against me
and your arrogance has come to my ears,
I will put my hook in your nose
and my bit in your mouth,
and I will turn you back on the way by which you came.


30 And this shall be the sign for you: This year you shall eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs from it; then in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
31 And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
32 For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion those who escape. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this."


33 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: "He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there, or come before it with a shield, or cast up a siege mound against it.
34 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city," declares the LORD.
35 "For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David."'"


36 And the angel of the LORD went out and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. And when men arose early in the morning, they saw all the dead bodies.
37 Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at Nineveh.
38 And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him down with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.




Chapter 38


1 In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill, and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order, for you are going to die; you will not live.”


2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
3 and said, “I beg you, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before you in truth and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept greatly.


4 Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying,
5 “Go and say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
6 And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.’”


7 “And this shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing which He has spoken:
8 Look how I will cause the shadow on the steps, which has gone down with the sun on the steps of Ahaz, to go back ten steps.” So the sun’s shadow went back the ten steps it had gone down.


9 A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:
10 I said, “In the middle of my days I shall go to the gates of Sheol;
I am deprived of the rest of my years.”
11 I said, “I will not see the LORD,
The LORD in the land of the living;
I will look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world.
12 My dwelling is pulled up and removed from me like a shepherd’s tent;
I have rolled up my life like a weaver;
He cuts me off from the loom;
From day to night You bring me to an end.


13 I composed myself until morning;
Like a lion He breaks all my bones;
From day to night You bring me to an end.
14 Like a swallow or a crane, so I chirp;
I moan like a dove;
My eyes look wistfully upward;
O Lord, I am oppressed, be my security.


15 What shall I say? For He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done it;
I shall walk carefully all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
16 O Lord, by these things men live,
And in all these is the life of my spirit;
Restore me to health and let me live.
17 See how it was for my welfare that I had great bitterness;
But You have kept my soul from the pit of destruction,
For You have cast all my sins behind Your back.
18 For the grave cannot thank You,
Death cannot praise You;
Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness.
19 The living, the living, he shall praise You, as I do this day;
A father shall make known Your faithfulness to his children.
20 The LORD will save me;
Therefore we will play my songs on stringed instruments
All the days of our life in the house of the LORD.”
21 Then Isaiah said, “Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may recover.”
22 Then Hezekiah had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?”




Chapter 39


1 At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
2 Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them all his treasure house—the silver and the gold and the spices and the fine oil—and his whole armory, and everything that was found among his treasures; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.


3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?” And Hezekiah said, “They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon.”
4 And he said, “What have they seen in your house?” And Hezekiah said, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”


5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
6 ‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your fathers have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,’ says the LORD.
7 ‘And some of your own sons who shall issue from you, whom you will father, shall be taken away, and they shall become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”


8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD which you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “At least there will be peace and stability in my days.”




Chapter 40


1 “Comfort, comfort My people,” says your God.
2 “Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and call out to her that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received from the hand of the LORD double for all her sins.”


3 A voice is calling: “Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
4 Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.
5 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”


6 A voice says, “Call out.” And I said, “What shall I call out?”
“All flesh is grass, and all its beauty is like the flower of the field.
7 The grass withers, the flower fades when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; surely the people are grass.
8 The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God shall stand forever.”


9 Go up on a high mountain, O herald of good news to Zion; lift up your voice with strength, O herald of good news to Jerusalem. Lift it up, do not be afraid; say to the cities of Judah, “Behold your God!”
10 Behold, the Lord GOD comes with strength, and His arm rules for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.
11 He will tend His flock like a shepherd; He will gather the lambs in His arm, and carry them in His bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.


12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, or measured the heavens with a span, or enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure, or weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance?
13 Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or as His counselor has informed Him?
14 With whom did He consult, and who gave Him understanding, and taught Him the path of justice, and taught Him knowledge, and showed Him the way of understanding?


15 Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as dust on the scales; look how He takes up the coastlands like fine dust.
16 Even Lebanon is not enough to burn, nor its beasts enough for a burnt offering.
17 All the nations are as nothing before Him; they are counted by Him as less than nothing and emptiness.


18 To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness will you compare to Him?
19 An idol?—a craftsman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it.
20 He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses wood that will not rot; he seeks out a skillful craftsman to set up an idol that will not be moved.


21 Do you not know? Do you not hear? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
22 It is He who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;
23 who brings princes to nothing, and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness.


24 Hardly are they planted, hardly are they sown, hardly has their stem taken root in the earth, when He blows on them, and they wither, and the tempest carries them away like stubble.


25 “To whom then will you compare Me, that I should be like him?” says the Holy One.
26 Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of His might and because He is strong in power, not one is missing.


27 Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, “My way is hidden from the LORD, and my right is disregarded by my God”?
28 Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not faint or grow weary; His understanding is unsearchable.
29 He gives strength to the faint, and to him who has no might He increases power.
30 Even youths shall faint and grow weary, and young men shall fall exhausted;
31 but those who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not grow weary; they shall walk and not faint.




Chapter 41


1 Be silent before Me, coastlands, and let the peoples renew their strength;
let them approach, then let them speak; let us come together for judgment.


2 Who stirred up from the east the one whom righteousness calls to its feet?
He delivers nations before him and subdues kings;
He makes them like dust with his sword,
like driven stubble with his bow.
3 He pursues them and passes on in safety,
by a path his feet have not traveled.
4 Who has accomplished and done this,
calling the generations from the beginning?
I, the LORD, am the first, and with the last—I am He.


5 The coastlands have seen and fear;
the ends of the earth tremble;
they draw near and come.
6 Each one helps his neighbor, and says to his brother, “Be strong!”
7 So the craftsman strengthens the goldsmith,
and he who smooths with the hammer strengthens him who strikes the anvil,
saying of the soldering, “It is good”;
and they fasten it with nails so it will not totter.


8 But you, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,
the seed of Abraham My friend—
9 you whom I took from the ends of the earth,
and called from its farthest corners,
and said to you, “You are My servant,
I have chosen you and not cast you off—
10 do not fear, for I am with you;
do not be dismayed, for I am your God;
I will strengthen you, I will surely help you,
I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.”


11 Watch how all who are incensed against you will be put to shame and confounded;
those who strive with you will be as nothing and perish.
12 You will seek those who contend with you, but you will not find them;
those who war against you will be as nothing at all.
13 For I, the LORD your God, hold your right hand;
I say to you, “Do not fear, I am the one who helps you.”


14 Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel;
I am the one who helps you, declares the LORD;
your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
15 Look how I have made you a threshing sledge, new, sharp, and with double edges;
you will thresh the mountains and crush them, and make the hills like chaff.
16 You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away,
and the tempest will scatter them.
And you will rejoice in the LORD;
in the Holy One of Israel you will glory.


17 The afflicted and the needy seek water, and there is none;
their tongue is parched with thirst. I, the LORD, will answer them;
I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
18 I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys.
I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
19 I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive.
I will set in the desert the cypress, the plane, and the pine together,
20 that they may see and know, may consider and understand together,
that the hand of the LORD has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.


21 Present your case, says the LORD;
bring forth your arguments, says the King of Jacob.
22 Let them bring them, and tell us what will happen.
Tell us the former things, what they are,
that we may consider them and know their outcome;
or declare to us the things to come.
23 Tell us what is to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods;
indeed, do good or do harm, that we may be dismayed and see it together.
24 See, you are nothing, and your work is less than nothing;
he who chooses you is an abomination.


25 I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes;
from the rising of the sun he will call upon My name.
He will trample rulers as on mortar, as the potter treads clay.
26 Who declared it from the beginning, that we might know, and beforehand,
that we might say, “He is right”? There was none who declared it,
none who proclaimed, none who heard your words.
27 I was the first to say to Zion, “Behold, here they are!”
and I give to Jerusalem a herald of good news.
28 But when I look, there is no one;
among these there is no counselor who, when I ask them, gives an answer.
29 Behold, they are all a delusion;
their works are nothing;
their molten images are wind and emptiness.




Chapter 42


1 This is my Servant, whom I uphold,
my chosen one, in whom my soul delights.
I have put my Spirit upon him;
he will bring forth justice to the nations.
2 He will not cry out nor raise his voice,
nor make it heard in the street.
3 A bruised reed he will not break,
and a dimly burning wick he will not quench;
he will faithfully bring forth justice.
4 He will not grow faint nor be discouraged,
until he has established justice in the earth;
and the coastlands will wait for his instruction.


5 Thus says God, the LORD,
who created the heavens and stretched them out,
who spread out the earth and what comes from it,
who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it:
6 I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness, and will take hold of your hand;
I will keep you and give you as a covenant for the people, as a light for the nations,
7 to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out the prisoner from confinement,
and those who sit in darkness from the prison house.
8 I am the LORD; that is my name.
My glory I will not give to another, nor my praise to idols.


9 The former things have come to pass,
and new things I now declare;
before they spring forth I announce them to you.


10 Sing to the LORD a new song,
his praise from the end of the earth,
you who go down to the sea and all that is in it,
the coastlands and their inhabitants.
11 Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voice,
the villages that Kedar inhabits.
Let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy;
let them shout from the top of the mountains.
12 Let them give glory to the LORD,
and declare his praise in the coastlands.


13 The LORD will go forth like a mighty man;
like a man of war he will stir up his zeal;
he will cry out, yes, he will shout aloud;
he will prevail against his enemies.


14 I have kept silent for a long time,
I have been quiet and restrained myself;
now I will cry out like a woman in labor,
I will gasp and pant.
15 I will lay waste mountains and hills,
and dry up all their vegetation;
I will turn rivers into islands, and dry up pools.
16 I will lead the blind by a way they do not know;
in paths they have not known I will guide them.
I will turn darkness before them into light,
and rough places into level ground.
These are the things I will do, and I will not forsake them.


17 They will be turned back and utterly put to shame,
those who trust in idols, who say to molten images, “You are our gods.”


18 Hear, you deaf, and look, you blind, that you may see.
19 Who is blind but my servant, or deaf as my messenger whom I send?
Who is blind as my covenant servant, or blind as the servant of the LORD?
20 You have seen many things, but you do not observe;
your ears are open, but you do not hear.


21 The LORD was pleased, for the sake of his righteousness,
to magnify the law and make it glorious.
22 But this is a people plundered and despoiled;
all of them are trapped in holes or hidden away in prisons;
they have become a prey, with no one to rescue,
a spoil, with no one to say, “Restore!”


23 Who among you will give ear to this,
will listen and hear for the time to come?
24 Who gave Jacob to the plunderer, and Israel to the robbers?
Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned,
in whose ways they were not willing to walk,
and whose law they would not obey?
25 Therefore he poured out on him the heat of his anger and the might of battle;
it set him aflame all around, yet he did not understand;
it burned him, but he did not take it to heart.




Chapter 43


1 But now thus says the LORD,
He who created you, O Jacob,
He who formed you, O Israel:
"Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;
I have called you by name; you are Mine.
2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
and through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you;
when you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched,
and the flame will not consume you.
3 For I am the LORD your God,
the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.
I give Egypt as your ransom,
Cush and Seba in exchange for you.
4 Because you are precious in My eyes,
honored, and I love you,
I will give men in place of you,
and peoples in exchange for your life.


5 Do not fear, for I am with you;
I will bring your offspring from the east,
and from the west I will gather you.
6 I will say to the north, 'Give them up!'
and to the south, 'Do not hold them back!'
Bring My sons from afar,
and My daughters from the ends of the earth,
7 everyone who is called by My name,
whom I created for My glory,
whom I formed and made."


8 Bring out the people who are blind, yet have eyes,
and the deaf, yet have ears!
9 Let all the nations gather together,
and let the peoples assemble.
Who among them can declare this,
and show us former things?
Let them bring their witnesses to prove them right,
and let them hear and say, "It is true."
10 "You are My witnesses," declares the LORD,
"and My servant whom I have chosen,
that you may know and believe Me,
and understand that I am He.
Before Me no god was formed,
nor will there be any after Me.
11 I, I am the LORD,
and besides Me there is no savior.
12 I declared and saved and proclaimed,
when there was no strange god among you;
and you are My witnesses," declares the LORD,
"and I am God.
13 Also from this day on I am He;
there is none who can deliver from My hand;
I act, and who can undo it?"


14 Thus says the LORD,
your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
"For your sake I send to Babylon
and bring down all of them as fugitives,
even the Chaldeans, in the ships in which they rejoice.
15 I am the LORD, your Holy One,
the Creator of Israel, your King."


16 Thus says the LORD,
who makes a way in the sea,
a path in the mighty waters,
17 who brings forth chariot and horse,
army and warrior;
they lie down, they cannot rise,
they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:
18 "Do not remember the former things,
nor consider the things of old.
19 Behold, I am doing a new thing;
now it springs forth—do you not perceive it?
I will make a way in the wilderness
and rivers in the desert.
20 The wild beasts will honor Me,
the jackals and the ostriches,
for I give water in the wilderness,
rivers in the desert,
to give drink to My chosen people,
21 the people whom I formed for Myself,
that they might declare My praise.


22 Yet you did not call upon Me, O Jacob;
but you have been weary of Me, O Israel!
23 You have not brought Me your sheep for burnt offerings,
or honored Me with your sacrifices.
I have not burdened you with offerings,
or wearied you with frankincense.
24 You have not bought Me sweet cane with money,
or satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices.
But you have burdened Me with your sins;
you have wearied Me with your iniquities.
25 I, I am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake,
and I will not remember your sins.
26 Put Me in remembrance; let us argue the case together;
set forth your case, that you may be proved right.


27 Your first father sinned,
and your mediators transgressed against Me.
28 Therefore I profaned the princes of the sanctuary,
and delivered Jacob to destruction,
and Israel to reviling.




Chapter 44


1 But now hear, O Jacob my servant,
and Israel whom I have chosen:
2 Thus says the LORD, your Maker,
who formed you from the womb and will help you:
"Do not be afraid, O Jacob my servant,
Jeshurun whom I have chosen.
3 For I will pour out water on the thirsty land,
and streams on the dry ground;
I will pour out my Spirit on your descendants,
and my blessing on your offspring.
4 They will spring up among the grass
like willows by flowing streams.


5 This one will say, 'I am the LORD’s,'
another will be called by the name of Jacob,
another will write on his hand, "Belonging to the LORD,'
and will name himself by the name of Israel.


6 Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel
and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts:
I am the first, and I am the last;
besides Me there is no god.
7 Who is like Me? Let him proclaim it;
let him declare and set it before Me,
since I appointed an ancient people.
Let them declare what is coming,
and what will happen.
8 Do not tremble, and do not be afraid.
Have I not long ago made it known to you and declared it?
And you are My witnesses!
Is there any God besides Me?
No, there is no Rock; I know none.


9 Those who form an idol are nothing,
and their precious things will not profit;
their witnesses neither see nor know,
so that they may be put to shame.
10 Who fashions a god or casts an idol
to no profit?
11 You will see, all his companions will be put to shame,
and the craftsmen are only men;
let them all assemble, let them stand up,
they will be terrified, they will be put to shame together.
12 The ironsmith takes a cutting tool
and works it over the coals,
fashioning it with hammers
and working it with his strong arm;
he becomes hungry, and his strength fails,
he drinks no water and grows faint.
13 The carpenter stretches out a line;
he marks it out with a pencil;
he shapes it with planes
and marks it with a compass;
he shapes it like the figure of a man,
like the glory of man,
to dwell in a house.
14 He cuts down cedars,
or he takes a cypress or an oak,
and lets it grow strong for himself
among the trees of the forest.
He plants a cedar,
and the rain makes it grow.
15 Then it becomes fuel for a man;
he takes some of it and warms himself,
he also kindles a fire and bakes bread.
Also he makes a god and worships it;
he makes it into an idol and bows down before it.
16 Half of it he burns in the fire;
over this half he eats meat,
he roasts a roast and is satisfied;
he also warms himself and says,
“Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire!”
17 And from the rest he makes a god, his idol,
and falls down to it and worships it;
he prays to it and says,
“Deliver me, for you are my god!”
18 They do not know, nor do they discern,
for He has smeared their eyes so they cannot see,
and their hearts so they cannot understand.
19 No one considers,
nor is there knowledge or understanding to say,
“Half of it I burned in the fire;
I also baked bread on its coals;
I roasted meat and ate.
And shall I make the rest of it into an abomination?
Shall I bow down to a block of wood?”
20 He feeds on ashes;
a deceived heart has turned him aside,
so that he cannot deliver his soul
or say, “Is there not a lie in my right hand?”


21 Remember these things, O Jacob,
and Israel, for you are My servant;
I formed you, you are My servant;
O Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me.
22 I have blotted out your transgressions like a cloud,
and your sins like mist;
return to Me,
for I have redeemed you.


23 Sing, O heavens, for the LORD has done it;
shout, O depths of the earth;
break forth into singing, O mountains,
forest, and every tree in it!
For the LORD has redeemed Jacob,
and will display His glory in Israel.
24 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer,
who formed you from the womb:
I am the LORD, who made all things,
who alone stretched out the heavens,
who spread out the earth by Myself,
25 who frustrates the signs of liars
and makes fools of diviners,
who turns wise men back
and makes their knowledge foolish,
26 who confirms the word of His servant
and fulfills the counsel of His messengers,
who says of Jerusalem, “She shall be inhabited,”
and of the cities of Judah, “They shall be rebuilt,
and I will raise up their ruins,”
27 who says to the deep, “Be dry;
I will dry up your rivers,”
28 who says of Cyrus, “He is My shepherd,
and he shall fulfill all My purpose,”
saying of Jerusalem, “She shall be built,”
and of the temple, “Your foundation shall be laid.”




Chapter 45


1 Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him and to ungird the loins of kings, to open doors before him so that gates will not be shut:
2 “I will go before you and level the exalted places; I will shatter the doors of bronze and cut through the bars of iron.
3 I will give you the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that it is I, the LORD, the God of Israel, who calls you by your name.
4 For the sake of Jacob my servant, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name; I give you a title of honor, though you have not known me.
5 I am the LORD, and there is no other; besides me there is no God. I gird you, though you have not known me,
6 that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none besides me; I am the LORD, and there is no other.
7 I form light and create darkness; I make peace and create calamity; I, the LORD, do all these things.


8 Shower down, O heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, that salvation may sprout forth, and let it cause righteousness to spring up together; I, the LORD, have created it.


9 Woe to him who strives with his Maker, a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him who forms it, “What are you making?” or “Your work has no handles”?
10 Woe to him who says to a father, “What are you fathering?” or to a woman, “What are you giving birth to?”


11 Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: “Ask me of things to come concerning my sons; and concerning the work of my hands, command me.
12 I have made the earth, and created man upon it; my own hands stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host.
13 I have stirred him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways; he shall build my city and set my exiles free, not for price or reward,” says the LORD of hosts.


14 Thus says the LORD: “The wealth of Egypt, and the merchandise of Cush, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to you and be yours; they shall walk behind you, they shall come over in chains and bow down to you. They will plead with you, saying, ‘Surely God is in you, and there is no other, no god besides him.’”
15 Truly, you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior.
16 They shall be put to shame and confounded, all of them; the makers of idols shall go in confusion together.
17 But Israel is saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; you shall not be put to shame or confounded to all eternity.


18 For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens—he is God—who formed the earth and made it—he established it; he did not create it empty, he formed it to be inhabited—“I am the LORD, and there is no other.
19 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth; I did not say to the seed of Jacob, ‘Seek me in vain.’ I, the LORD, speak righteousness; I declare what is right.


20 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you survivors of the nations! Those who carry about their wooden idols have no knowledge, and keep on praying to a god that cannot save.
21 Declare and present your case; let them consult together. Who has announced this from of old? Who has declared it from long ago? Was it not I, the LORD? And there is no other god besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none besides me.


22 Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other.
23 By myself I have sworn; the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return: “To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.”


24 Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength; to him shall come and be ashamed all who were incensed against him.
25 In the LORD all the seed of Israel shall be justified and shall glory.




Chapter 46


1 Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols are upon beasts and cattle. These things that you carry are burdens, a load for the weary beast.
2 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not save the burden, but themselves go into captivity.


3 Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been borne by me from before your birth, carried from the womb.
4 Even to your old age I am he, and to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save.


5 To whom will you liken me and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be alike?
6 Those who lavish gold from the purse and weigh out silver in the scales hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god; then they fall down and worship.
7 They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it, they set it in its place, and it stands; from its place it does not move. Though one cries to it, it does not answer or save him from his trouble.


8 Remember this and stand firm, recall it to mind, you transgressors.
9 Remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me,
10 declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, “My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,”
11 calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it.


12 Listen to me, you stubborn of heart, you who are far from righteousness:
13 I bring near my righteousness, it is not far off, and my salvation will not delay; I will grant salvation in Zion, my glory for Israel.




Chapter 47


1 Come down and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans. For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.
2 Take the millstones and grind flour, uncover your veil, strip off your skirt, uncover your legs, wade through the rivers.
3 Your nakedness shall be uncovered, your shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will spare no man.
4 Our Redeemer—the LORD of hosts is his name—is the Holy One of Israel.


5 Sit in silence and go into darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans, for you shall no longer be called the mistress of kingdoms.
6 I was angry with my people; I profaned my heritage; I gave them into your hand; you showed them no mercy; on the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy.
7 You said, “I shall be mistress forever,” so you did not lay these things to heart or remember their end.


8 Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me; I shall not sit as a widow or know the loss of children”—
9 these two things shall come to you in a moment, in one day; the loss of children and widowhood shall come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and the great power of your enchantments.


10 You felt secure in your wickedness; you said, “No one sees me.” Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me.”
11 But evil shall come upon you, which you will not know how to charm away; disaster shall fall upon you, for which you cannot atone; and ruin shall come upon you suddenly, of which you know nothing.


12 Stand fast in your enchantments and your many sorceries, with which you have labored from your youth; perhaps you may be able to succeed, perhaps you may inspire terror.
13 You are wearied with your many counsels; let them stand forth and save you, those who divide the heavens, who gaze at the stars, who make known at new moons what shall come upon you.
14 Behold, they are like stubble; the fire consumes them; they cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame. No coal for warming oneself is this, no fire to sit before!
15 Such to you are those with whom you have labored, who have trafficked with you from your youth; they wander about, each in his own direction; there is no one to save you.




Chapter 48


1 Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and who came from the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of the LORD and confess the God of Israel, but not in truth or in righteousness.
2 For they call themselves after the holy city and lean on the God of Israel—the LORD of hosts is his name.


3 The former things I declared long ago; they went out from my mouth, and I announced them; then suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.
4 Because I know that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead bronze,
5 I declared them to you from long ago; before they came to pass I announced them to you, lest you should say, “My idol did them, my carved image and my molten image commanded them.”
6 You have heard; now see all this; and will you not declare it? From this time forth I announce to you new things, hidden things that you have not known.
7 They are created now, not long ago; before today you had never heard of them, lest you should say, “Behold, I knew them.”
8 You have never heard, you have never known, from of old your ear has not been opened. For I knew that you would deal very treacherously, and were called a transgressor from the womb.


9 For my name’s sake I defer my anger, and for my praise I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off.
10 Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
11 For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.


12 Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called: I am he; I am the first, and I am the last.
13 My hand laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I call to them, they stand forth together.


14 Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he shall perform his purpose on Babylon, and his arm shall be against the Chaldeans.
15 I, even I, have spoken and called him; I have brought him, and he will prosper in his way.


16 Draw near to me, hear this: from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time it came to be, I have been there. And now the Lord GOD has sent me, and his Spirit.


17 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the LORD your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you in the way you should go.
18 Oh that you had paid attention to my commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea;
19 your offspring would have been like the sand, and your descendants like its grains; their name would never be cut off or destroyed from before me.


20 Go out from Babylon, flee from Chaldea, declare this with a shout of joy, proclaim it, send it out to the end of the earth; say, “The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob!”
21 They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he split the rock and the water gushed out.


22 “There is no peace,” says the LORD, “for the wicked.”




Chapter 49


1 Listen to me, O coastlands, and give attention, you peoples from afar. The LORD called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name.
2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow; in his quiver he concealed me.
3 And he said to me, “You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”
4 But I said, “I have labored in vain; I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely my right is with the LORD, and my recompense with my God.”


5 And now the LORD says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him—for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD, and my God has become my strength—
6 he says: “It is too small a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel; I will make you a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”


7 Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One, to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nation, the servant of rulers: “Kings shall see and arise; princes also shall bow down, because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”


8 Thus says the LORD: “In a time of favor I have answered you; in a day of salvation I have helped you; I will keep you and give you as a covenant to the people, to establish the land, to apportion the desolate heritages,
9 saying to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’ to those who are in darkness, ‘Appear.’ They shall feed along the ways; on all bare heights shall be their pasture;
10 they shall not hunger or thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them, for he who has mercy on them will lead them, and by springs of water he will guide them.
11 And I will make all my mountains a road, and my highways shall be raised up.
12 Behold, these shall come from afar, and behold, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Syene.”


13 Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth; break forth, O mountains, into singing! For the LORD has comforted his people and will have compassion on his afflicted.


14 But Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me; my Lord has forgotten me.”
15 Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.
16 Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.
17 Your builders make haste; your destroyers and those who laid you waste go out from you.


18 Lift up your eyes around and see; they all gather, they come to you. As I live, declares the LORD, you shall put them all on as an ornament; you shall bind them on as a bride does.
19 Surely your waste and your desolate places and your devastated land—surely now you will be too narrow for your inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away.
20 The children of your bereavement will yet say in your ears, “The place is too narrow for me; make room for me to dwell in.”
21 Then you will say in your heart: “Who has borne me these? I was bereaved and barren, exiled and put away, but who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; from where have these come?”


22 Thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and raise my signal to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
23 Kings shall be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. With their faces to the ground they shall bow down to you and lick the dust of your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who wait for me shall not be put to shame.”


24 Can the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?
25 For thus says the LORD: “Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken, and the prey of the tyrant shall be rescued, for I will contend with those who contend with you, and I will save your children.
26 I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh, and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine. Then all flesh shall know that I am the LORD your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”




Chapter 50


1 Thus says the LORD:
“Where is your mother’s certificate of divorce, with which I sent her away?
Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you?
Behold, for your iniquities you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.


2 Why, when I came, was there no man?
Why, when I called, was there no one to answer?
Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem?
Or have I no power to deliver?
Look how I dry up the sea by my rebuke,
I make the rivers a desert;
their fish stink for lack of water,
and die of thirst.
3 I clothe the heavens with blackness
and make sackcloth their covering.”


4 The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of those who are taught,
that I may know how to sustain with a word him who is weary.
Morning by morning he awakens,
he awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.
5 The Lord GOD has opened my ear,
and I was not rebellious;
I did not turn backward.
6 I gave my back to those who strike,
and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard;
I hid not my face
from disgrace and spitting.


7 But the Lord GOD helps me;
therefore I have not been disgraced;
therefore I have set my face like flint,
and I know that I shall not be put to shame.
8 He who vindicates me is near.
Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together.
Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.
9 Look how the Lord GOD helps me;
All who declare me guilty,
yes, all of them will wear out like a garment;
the moth will eat them up.


10 Who among you fears the LORD
and obeys the voice of his servant?
Let him who walks in darkness
and has no light
trust in the name of the LORD
and rely on his God.
11 All you who kindle a fire,
who equip yourselves with burning torches,
walk by the light of your fire,
and by the torches that you have kindled!
This you have from my hand:
you shall lie down in torment.




Chapter 51


1 Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the LORD: look to the rock from which you were hewn, and to the quarry from which you were dug.
2 Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you; for he was but one when I called him, that I might bless him and multiply him.
3 For the LORD comforts Zion; he comforts all her waste places and makes her wilderness like Eden, her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the voice of song.


4 Give attention to me, my people, and give ear to me, my nation; for a law will go out from me, and I will set my justice for a light to the nations.
5 My righteousness draws near, my salvation has gone out, and my arms will judge the nations; the coastlands hope for me, and for my arm they wait.
6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth beneath; for the heavens vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and they who dwell in it will die in like manner; but my salvation will be forever, and my righteousness will never be dismayed.


7 Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear not the reproach of man, nor be dismayed at their revilings.
8 For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool; but my righteousness will be forever, and my salvation to all generations.


9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in days of old, the generations of long ago. Was it not you who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the dragon?
10 Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
11 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.


12 I, I am he who comforts you; who are you that you are afraid of man who dies, of the son of man who is made like grass,
13 and have forgotten the LORD, your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, and you fear continually all the day because of the wrath of the oppressor, when he sets himself to destroy? But where is the wrath of the oppressor?
14 He who is bowed down shall speedily be released; he shall not die and go down to the pit, neither shall his bread be lacking.
15 I am the LORD your God, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—the LORD of hosts is his name.
16 And I have put my words in your mouth and covered you in the shadow of my hand, establishing the heavens and laying the foundations of the earth, and saying to Zion, “You are my people.”


17 Wake yourself, wake yourself, stand up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of his wrath, who have drunk to the dregs the bowl, the cup of staggering.
18 There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne; there is none to take her by the hand among all the sons she has brought up.
19 These two things have happened to you—who will console you?—devastation and destruction, famine and sword; who will comfort you?
20 Your sons have fainted; they lie at the head of every street like an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.


21 Therefore hear this, you who are afflicted, who are drunk, but not with wine:
22 Thus says your Lord, the LORD, your God who pleads the cause of his people: “Look how I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering, the bowl of my wrath; you shall drink no more;
23 and I will put it into the hand of your tormentors, who have said to you, ‘Bow down, that we may pass over’; and you have made your back like the ground and like the street for them to pass over.”




Chapter 52


1 Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.
2 Shake yourself from the dust and arise; be seated, O Jerusalem; loose the bonds from your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.


3 For thus says the LORD: You were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money.
4 For thus says the Lord GOD: My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there, and the Assyrian oppressed them for nothing.
5 Now therefore what have I here, declares the LORD, seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Their rulers wail, declares the LORD, and continually all the day my name is despised.
6 Therefore my people shall know my name; therefore in that day they shall know that it is I who speak; here I am.


7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, “Your God reigns.”
8 The voice of your watchmen—they lift up their voice; together they sing for joy; for eye to eye they see the return of the LORD to Zion.
9 Break forth together into singing, you waste places of Jerusalem, for the LORD has comforted his people; he has redeemed Jerusalem.
10 The LORD has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.


11 Depart, depart, go out from there; touch no unclean thing; go out from the midst of her; purify yourselves, you who bear the vessels of the LORD.
12 For you shall not go out in haste, and you shall not go in flight, for the LORD will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.


13 Behold, my servant shall act wisely; he shall be high and lifted up, and shall be exalted.
14 As many were astonished at you—his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of the children of mankind—
15 so shall he sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths because of him, for that which has not been told them they see, and that which they have not heard they understand.




Chapter 53


1 Who has believed what he has heard from us? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
2 For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.
3 He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.


4 Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.
5 But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.
6 All of us, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned, every one, to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.


7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.
8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off from the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people?
9 And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.


10 Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering for guilt, he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.
11 Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.
12 Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors.




Chapter 54


1 Sing, O barren one, who did not bear; break forth into singing and cry aloud, you who have not been in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than the children of her who is married, says the LORD.
2 Enlarge the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out; do not hold back; lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes.
3 For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left, and your offspring will possess the nations and will people the desolate cities.


4 Fear not, for you will not be ashamed; be not confounded, for you will not be disgraced; for you will forget the shame of your youth, and the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more.
5 For your Maker is your husband, the LORD of hosts is his name; and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer, the God of the whole earth he is called.
6 For the LORD has called you like a wife deserted and grieved in spirit, like a wife of youth when she is cast off, says your God.
7 For a brief moment I deserted you, but with great compassion I will gather you.
8 In overflowing anger for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says the LORD, your Redeemer.


9 This is like the days of Noah to me: as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, and will not rebuke you.
10 For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed, says the LORD, who has compassion on you.


11 O afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in antimony, and lay your foundations with sapphires.
12 I will make your pinnacles of agate, your gates of carbuncles, and all your wall of precious stones.
13 All your sons shall be taught by the LORD, and great shall be the peace of your sons.
14 In righteousness you shall be established; you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.
15 If anyone stirs up strife, it is not from me; whoever stirs up strife with you shall fall because of you.


16 Look how I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals and produces a weapon for its purpose; I have also created the ravager to destroy.
17 No weapon that is fashioned against you shall succeed, and you shall refute every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD and their vindication from me, declares the LORD.




Chapter 55


1 Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
2 Why do you spend your money on things which are not bread, and your labor on things which do not satisfy? Listen diligently to me, and eat what is good, and delight yourselves in rich food.
3 Incline your ear, and come to me; hear, that your soul may live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, my steadfast, sure love for David.


4 I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the peoples.
5 But you shall call to a nation that you do not know, and a nation that did not know you shall run to you, because of the LORD your God, and of the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified you.


6 Seek the LORD while he may be found; call upon him while he is near;
7 let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.


8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.
9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.


10 For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
11 so shall my word be: it goes out from my mouth and shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I intend, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.


12 For you shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and the hills before you shall break forth into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress; instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle; and it shall make a name for the LORD, an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.




Chapter 56


1 Thus says the LORD: maintain justice, and do righteousness, for soon my salvation will come, and my righteousness be revealed.
2 Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast, who keeps the sabbath, not profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.


3 Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, “The LORD will surely separate me from his people”; and let not the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dry tree.”
4 For thus says the LORD: To the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths, who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant,
5 I will give in my house and within my walls a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.


6 And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD, to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD, and to be his servants, everyone who keeps the sabbath and does not profane it, and holds fast my covenant—
7 these I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar, for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.
8 The Lord GOD, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, declares, I will gather yet others to him besides those already gathered.


9 All you beasts of the field, come to devour—all you beasts in the forest.
10 His watchmen are blind; they are all without knowledge; they are all silent dogs; they cannot bark, dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
11 The dogs have a mighty appetite; they never have enough. But they are shepherds who have no understanding; they have all turned to their own way, each to his own gain, one and all.
12 “Come,” they say, “let me get wine; let us fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow will be like this day, great beyond measure.”




Chapter 57


1 The righteous man perishes, and no man lays it to heart; devout men are taken away, while no one understands. For the righteous man is taken away from calamity;
2 he enters into peace; they rest in their beds who walk in their uprightness.


3 But you, draw near, sons of a sorceress, offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute.
4 Whom are you mocking? Against whom do you open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, the offspring of deceit,
5 you who burn with lust among the oaks, under every green tree; who slaughter your children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
6 Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they are your lot; to them you have poured out a drink offering, you have brought a grain offering. Shall I relent for these things?


7 On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed, and there you went up to offer sacrifice.
8 Behind the door and the doorpost you have set up your memorial; for, deserting me, you have uncovered your bed, you have gone up to it, you have made it wide; and you have made a covenant for yourself with them, you have loved their bed, you have looked on their nakedness.
9 You journeyed to the king with oil and multiplied your perfumes; you sent your envoys far off, and sent them down even to the grave.
10 You were wearied with the length of your journey, but you did not say, “It is hopeless”; you found new life for your strength, and so you were not faint.


11 Whom did you dread and fear, so that you lied, and did not remember me, did not lay it to heart? Have I not held my peace, even for a long time, and you do not fear me?
12 I will declare your righteousness and your works, but they will not profit you.
13 When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you! The wind will carry them off, a breath will take them away. But he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land and inherit my holy mountain.


14 And it shall be said, “Build up, build up, prepare the way, remove every obstruction from my people’s way.”
15 For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly, and to revive the heart of the contrite.
16 For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry; for the spirit would grow faint before me, and the breath of life that I made.


17 Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry, I struck him; I hid my face and was angry, but he went on backsliding in the way of his own heart.
18 I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will lead him and restore comfort to him and to his mourners,
19 creating the fruit of the lips. Peace, peace, to the far and to the near, says the LORD, and I will heal him.
20 But the wicked are like the tossing sea, for it cannot be quiet, and its waters toss up mire and dirt.
21 There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked.




Chapter 58


1 Cry aloud; do not hold back; lift up your voice like a trumpet; declare to my people their transgression, to the house of Jacob their sins.
2 Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways, as if they were a nation that did righteousness and did not forsake the judgment of their God; they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God.
3 “Why have we fasted, and you see it not? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you take no knowledge of it?” Look how on the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure, and oppress all your workers.
4 You fast only to quarrel and to fight and to hit with a wicked fist. Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high.
5 Is such the fast that I choose, a day for a man to humble himself? Is it to bow down his head like a reed, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and a day acceptable to the LORD?


6 Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?
7 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover him, and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?
8 Then shall your light break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up speedily; your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.
9 Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; you shall cry, and he will say, “Here I am.” If you take away the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,
10 if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.


11 And the LORD will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scorched places and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.
12 And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to dwell in.


13 If you turn back your foot from the sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day, and call the sabbath a delight and the holy day of the LORD honorable; if you honor it, not going your own ways, or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly;
14 then you shall take delight in the LORD, and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.




Chapter 59


1 The hand of the LORD is not shortened, that it cannot save, or his ear dull, that it cannot hear;
2 but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.
3 For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness.


4 No one enters suit justly; no one goes to law honestly; they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity.
5 They hatch adders’ eggs; they weave the spider’s web; he who eats their eggs dies, and from one that is crushed a viper is hatched.
6 Their webs will not serve as clothing; men will not cover themselves with what they make. Their works are works of iniquity, and deeds of violence are in their hands.
7 Their feet run to evil, and they are swift to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their highways.
8 The way of peace they do not know, and there is no justice in their paths; they have made their roads crooked; no one who treads on them knows peace.


9 Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us; we hope for light, and see only darkness, and for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
10 We grope for the wall like the blind; we grope like those who have no eyes; we stumble at noon as in the twilight, among those in full vigor we are like dead men.
11 We all growl like bears; we moan and moan like doves; we hope for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us.
12 For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and we know our iniquities:
13 transgressing, and denying the LORD, and turning back from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart lying words.


14 Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far away; for truth has stumbled in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter.
15 Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. The LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.
16 He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to intercede; then his own arm brought him salvation, and his righteousness upheld him.
17 He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak.
18 According to their deeds, so will he repay, wrath to his adversaries, repayment to his enemies; to the coastlands he will render repayment.
19 So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come like a rushing stream, which the wind of the LORD drives.


20 And a Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn from transgression, declares the LORD.
21 “And as for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the LORD: “My Spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your offspring, or out of the mouth of your children’s offspring,” says the LORD, “from this time forth and forevermore.”




Chapter 60


1 Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.
2 For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the nations; but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.
3 And nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.


4 Lift up your eyes all around, and see; they all gather together, they come to you; your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried on the hip.
5 Then you shall see and be radiant; your heart shall thrill and exult, because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you.
6 A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD.
7 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you; the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will beautify my glorious house.


8 Who are these that fly like a cloud, and like doves to their windows?
9 For the coastlands shall hope for me, the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from afar, their silver and gold with them, for the name of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he has made you beautiful.


10 Foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall minister to you; for in my wrath I struck you, but in my favor I have had mercy on you.
11 Your gates shall be open continually; day and night they shall not be shut, that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, with their kings led in procession.
12 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; those nations shall be utterly laid waste.
13 The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress, the plane, and the pine, to beautify the place of my sanctuary, and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
14 The sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending low to you, and all who despised you shall bow down at your feet; they shall call you the City of the LORD, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.


15 Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, with no one passing through, I will make you majestic forever, a joy from age to age.
16 You shall suck the milk of nations; you shall nurse at the breast of kings; and you shall know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.


17 Instead of bronze I will bring gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver; instead of wood, bronze; instead of stones, iron. I will make peace your overseers and righteousness your taskmasters.
18 Violence shall no more be heard in your land, devastation or destruction within your borders; you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.


19 The sun shall be no more your light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give you light; but the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.
20 Your sun shall no more go down, nor your moon withdraw itself; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of mourning shall be ended.
21 Your people shall all be righteous; they shall possess the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I might be glorified.
22 The least one shall become a clan, and the smallest one a mighty nation; I am the LORD; in its time I will hasten it.




Chapter 61


1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
2 to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;
3 to grant to those who mourn in Zion— to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.


4 They shall build up the ancient ruins; they shall raise up the former devastations; they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.
5 Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks; foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;
6 but you shall be called the priests of the LORD; they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God; you shall eat the wealth of nations, and in their glory you shall boast.


7 Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion; instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot; therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion; they shall have everlasting joy.
8 For I, the LORD, love justice; I hate robbery with a burnt offering; I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
9 Their offspring shall be known among the nations, and their descendants in the midst of the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.


10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in my God, for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
11 For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up, so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to sprout up before all the nations.




Chapter 62


1 Thus says the LORD: Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool; what is the house that you would build for me, and what is the place of my rest?
2 All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares the LORD. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.
3 He who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, like one who breaks a dog’s neck; he who presents a grain offering, like one who offers pig’s blood; he who makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like one who blesses an idol. These have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations;
4 I also will choose harsh treatment for them and bring their fears upon them, because when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, they did not listen; but they did what was evil in my eyes and chose that in which I did not delight.


5 Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word: “Your brothers who hate you and cast you out for my name’s sake have said, ‘Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy’; but it is they who shall be put to shame.
6 The sound of an uproar from the city! A sound from the temple! The sound of the LORD, rendering recompense to his enemies!”


7 Before she was in labor she gave birth; before her pain came upon her she delivered a son.
8 Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment? For as soon as Zion was in labor she brought forth her children.
9 Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth? says the LORD; shall I, who cause to bring forth, shut the womb? says your God.


10 Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice with her in joy, all you who mourn over her;
11 that you may nurse and be satisfied from her consoling breast; that you may drink deeply with delight from her glorious abundance.


12 For thus says the LORD: Look how I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip, and bounced upon her knees.
13 As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
14 You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice; your bones shall flourish like the grass; and the hand of the LORD shall be known to his servants, and he shall show his indignation against his enemies.


15 For you will see that the LORD will come in fire, and his chariots like the whirlwind, to render his anger in fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
16 For by fire will the LORD enter into judgment, and by his sword, with all flesh; and those slain by the LORD shall be many.


17 Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, eating pig’s flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, declares the LORD.


18 For I know their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and shall see my glory,
19 and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands far away, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations.
20 And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering to the LORD, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.
21 And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.


22 For as the new heavens and the new earth that I make shall remain before me, says the LORD, so shall your offspring and your name remain.
23 From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, declares the LORD.


24 And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.




Chapter 63


1 Who is this who comes from Edom, in crimsoned garments from Bozrah, he who is splendid in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? “It is I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save.”
2 Why is your apparel red, and your garments like his who treads in the winepress?
3 “I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples no one was with me; I trod them in my anger and trampled them in my wrath; their lifeblood spattered on my garments, and stained all my apparel.
4 For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and my year of redemption had come.
5 I looked, but there was no one to help; I was appalled, but there was no one to uphold; so my own arm brought me salvation, and my wrath upheld me.
6 I trampled down the peoples in my anger; I made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.”


7 I will recount the steadfast love of the LORD, the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD has granted us, and the great goodness to the house of Israel that he has granted them according to his compassion, according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
8 For he said, “Surely they are my people, children who will not deal falsely.” And he became their Savior.
9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them; in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
10 But they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit; therefore he turned to be their enemy, and he himself fought against them.


11 Then he remembered the days of old, of Moses and his people. Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is he who put in the midst of them his Holy Spirit,
12 who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them to make for himself an everlasting name,
13 who led them through the depths? Like a horse in the desert, they did not stumble.
14 Like livestock that go down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. So you led your people, to make for yourself a glorious name.


15 Look down from heaven and see, from your holy and beautiful habitation. Where are your zeal and your might? The yearning of your heart and your compassions are withheld from me.
16 For you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us; you, O LORD, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name.
17 O LORD, why do you make us wander from your ways and harden our heart, so that we fear you not? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes of your heritage.
18 Your holy people held possession for a little while; our adversaries have trampled down your sanctuary.
19 We have become like those over whom you have never ruled, like those who are not called by your name.




Chapter 64


1 Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence—
2 as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil— to make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations might tremble at your presence!
3 When you did awesome things that we did not look for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
4 From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him.
5 You meet him who joyfully works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. You were angry, because we sinned; we have been in our sins for a long time, and shall we be saved?


6 We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
7 There is no one who calls upon your name, who rouses himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities.


8 But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.
9 Be not so terribly angry, O LORD, and remember not iniquity forever. Please look to us, for we are all your people.
10 Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
11 Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, has been burned by fire, and all our pleasant places have become ruins.
12 Will you restrain yourself at these things, O LORD? Will you keep silent, and afflict us so terribly?




Chapter 65


1 I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me; I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me. I said, “Here I am, here I am,” to a nation that was not called by my name.
2 I spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices;
3 a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens and making offerings on bricks;
4 who sit in tombs, and spend the night in secret places; who eat pig’s flesh, and broth of tainted meat is in their vessels;
5 who say, “Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am too holy for you.” These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all the day.


6 Behold, it is written before me: “I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will indeed repay into their lap
7 both your iniquities and your fathers’ iniquities together, says the LORD; because they made offerings on the mountains and insulted me on the hills, I will measure into their lap payment for their former deeds.”


8 Thus says the LORD: “As the new wine is found in the cluster, and they say, ‘Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it,’ so I will do for my servants’ sake, and not destroy them all.
9 I will bring forth offspring from Jacob, and possessors of my mountains from Judah; my chosen shall possess it, and my servants shall dwell there.
10 Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for my people who have sought me.


11 But you who forsake the LORD, who forget my holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny,
12 I will destine you for the sword, and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter, because, when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not listen; but you did what was evil in my eyes and chose what I did not delight in.”


13 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “You will see that my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; you will see that my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; and you will see that my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be put to shame;
14 you will see how my servants shall sing from gladness of heart, but you shall cry out for pain of heart and shall wail for breaking of spirit.
15 You shall leave your name before my chosen as a curse, and the Lord GOD will put you to death, but his servants he will call by another name,
16 so that he who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth, and he who swears on the land shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten and are hidden from my eyes.


17 For you will see that I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.
18 But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for I create Jerusalem to be a joy, and her people to be a gladness.
19 I will rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in my people; no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping and the cry of distress.


20 No more shall there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not fill out his days, for the young man shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.
21 They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
22 They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
23 They shall not labor in vain or bear children for calamity, for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the LORD, and their descendants with them.
24 Before they call I will answer; while they are yet speaking I will hear.
25 The wolf and the lamb shall graze together; the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, says the LORD.




Chapter 66


1 Thus says the LORD: Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool; what kind of house would you build for me, and what kind of place for me to rest?
2 All these things my hand has made, and thus all things came to be, declares the LORD. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.
3 He who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, like one who breaks a dog’s neck; he who presents a grain offering, like one who offers pig’s blood; he who makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like one who blesses an idol. These have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations;
4 I will also choose harsh treatment for them and bring their fears upon them, because when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, they did not listen; but they did what was evil in my eyes and chose that in which I did not delight.


5 Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word: “Your brothers who hate you and cast you out for my name’s sake have said, ‘Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy’; but it is they who shall be put to shame.
6 The sound of an uproar from the city! A sound from the temple! It is the sound of the LORD, rendering recompense to his enemies!”


7 Before she was in labor she gave birth; before her pain came upon her she delivered a son.
8 Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment? For as soon as Zion was in labor she brought forth her children.
9 Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth? says the LORD; shall I, who cause to bring forth, shut the womb? says your God.


10 Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice with her in joy, all you who mourn over her;
11 that you may nurse and be satisfied from her consoling breast; that you may drink deeply with delight from her glorious abundance.


12 For thus says the LORD: I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip, and bounced upon her knees.
13 As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
14 You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice; your bones shall flourish like the grass; and the hand of the LORD shall be known to his servants, and he shall show his indignation against his enemies.


15 For the LORD will come in fire, and his chariots like the whirlwind, to render his anger in fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
16 For by fire will the LORD enter into judgment, and by his sword, with all flesh; and those slain by the LORD shall be many.


17 Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, eating pig’s flesh and abominations and mice, shall come to an end together, declares the LORD.


18 For I know their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and shall see my glory,
19 and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands far away, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations.
20 And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering to the LORD, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.
21 And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.


22 For as the new heavens and the new earth that I make shall remain before me, says the LORD, so shall your offspring and your name remain.
23 From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, declares the LORD.


24 And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.﻿Jeremiah


Chapter 1


1 The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,
2 to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
3 It also came in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.


4 Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
5 “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you came forth from the womb I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”
6 Then I said, “Alas, Lord GOD! You can see that I do not know how to speak, for I am but a youth.”
7 But the LORD said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am but a youth,’ for to all to whom I send you, you shall go, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.
8 Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you,” declares the LORD.


9 Then the LORD stretched out his hand and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, “I have put my words in your mouth.
10 See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.”


11 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” And I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”
12 Then the LORD said to me, “You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it.”


13 And the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see a boiling pot, and its face is from the north.”
14 Then the LORD said to me, “From the north evil shall be unleashed upon all the inhabitants of the land.
15 For you will see how I am summoning all the clans of the kingdoms of the north,” declares the LORD. “They shall come, and each shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
16 And I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their evil, because they have forsaken me, and have made offerings to other gods, and worshiped the work of their own hands.


17 But you, gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed before them, lest I dismay you before them.
18 And I vow to you, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the people of the land.
19 They shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you,” declares the LORD, “to deliver you.”




Chapter 2


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.
3 Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of his harvest; all who ate of it became guilty, disaster came upon them,’ declares the LORD.”


4 Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel.
5 Thus says the LORD: “What wrong did your fathers find in me, that they went far from me, and walked after what is worthless, and became worthless?
6 They did not say, ‘Where is the LORD who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and pits, through a land of drought and deep darkness, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?’
7 I brought you into a fertile land, to eat its fruit and its good things. But when you entered, you defiled my land, and you made my heritage an abomination.
8 The priests did not say, ‘Where is the LORD?’ Those who handle the law did not know me; the shepherds transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal and went after things that do not profit.


9 Therefore I will contend with you again,” declares the LORD, “and with your children’s children I will contend.
10 For cross over to the coasts of Kittim and see, and send to Kedar and observe closely, and see if there has ever been such a thing.
11 Has a nation ever changed its gods, though they are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
12 Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate,” declares the LORD.
13 “For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, to hew for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.


14 Is Israel a slave? Was he born a servant? Why then has he become plunder?
15 Young lions have roared against him, they have raised their voice. They have made his land a waste; his cities are burned and inhabited2.
16 Even the men of Noph and Tahpanhes shave the crown of your head.
17 Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the LORD your God, when he was leading you in the way?
18 And now what have you to do with the road to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? Or what have you to do with the road to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
19 Your own evil will discipline you, and your apostasies will reprove you. Know then and see that it is evil and bitter to forsake the LORD your God, and the fear of me is not in you,” declares the Lord GOD of hosts.


20 “For long ago you broke your yoke and tore off your bonds, and you said, ‘I will not serve!’ Indeed, on every high hill and under every green tree you sprawled as a harlot.
21 Yet I planted you a choice vine, wholly of pure seed. How then have you turned degenerate and become a wild vine?
22 Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, your guilt is stained before me,” declares the Lord GOD.
23 “How can you say, ‘I am not defiled; I have not gone after the Baals’? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done—like a swift young she-camel running here and there,
24 a wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness, in the heat of her desire sniffing the wind. Who can restrain her lust? None who seek her need weary themselves; in her month they will find her.
25 Keep your foot from being unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, ‘It is hopeless, for I have loved foreigners, and after them I will go.’


26 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so the house of Israel shall be ashamed—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets—
27 who say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’ and to a stone, ‘You gave me birth.’ For they have turned their back to me, and not their face. But in the time of their trouble they say, ‘Arise and save us!’
28 But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble! For as numerous as your cities are your gods, O Judah.


29 “Why do you contend with me? You all have transgressed against me,” declares the LORD.
30 “In vain I have struck your children; they accepted no discipline. Your own sword has devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.
31 O generation, consider the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of deep darkness? Why do my people say, ‘We are free to roam; we will not come to you anymore’?
32 Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her sash? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.


33 How well you direct your course to seek love! Therefore you have even taught your ways to the wicked women.
34 Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor; you did not find them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things,
35 you say, ‘I am innocent; surely his anger has turned from me.’ Behold, I will enter into judgment with you, because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’
36 Why do you go about so much, changing your way? You will be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.
37 From this place also you will go out with your hands on your head; for the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper through them.




Chapter 3


1 It is said, “If a man sends away his wife, and she goes from him and becomes another man’s, will he return to her again? Would not that land be utterly defiled? But you have played the harlot with many lovers—and yet you return to me,” declares the LORD.
2 “Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been ravished? By the roads you sat for them like an Arab in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your harlotries and with your wickedness.
3 Therefore the showers have been withheld, and the spring rain has not come; yet you had the forehead of a harlot; you refused to be ashamed.
4 Have you not just now called to me, ‘My Father, you are the friend of my youth—
5 will he be angry forever, will he keep it to the end?’ But even though you have spoken like this, you continue doing all the evil you can.”


6 And the LORD said to me in the days of King Josiah, “Have you seen what faithless Israel has done? She went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and there played the harlot.
7 I said, ‘After she has done all these things, she will return to me,’ but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
8 She saw that for all the adulteries of faithless Israel I had sent her away and given her a bill of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she also went and played the harlot.
9 And it came to pass, through the lightness of her harlotry, that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and with tree.
10 Yet in spite of all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense,” declares the LORD.


11 And the LORD said to me, “Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
12 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say: ‘Return, faithless Israel,’ declares the LORD. ‘I will not look upon you in anger, for I am merciful,’ declares the LORD. ‘I will not be angry forever.
13 Only acknowledge your guilt, that you have rebelled against the LORD your God, and have scattered your favors among strangers under every green tree, and have not obeyed my voice,’ declares the LORD.
14 Return, O faithless children,” declares the LORD, “for I am your master, and I will take you, one from a city and two from a clan, and I will bring you to Zion.
15 Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.


16 And it shall come to pass, when you have multiplied and become fruitful in the land, in those days,” declares the LORD, “they will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of the LORD.’ It shall not come to mind, nor shall they remember it, nor shall they miss it, nor shall it be made again.
17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD, and all nations shall gather to it, to the name of the LORD in Jerusalem, and they shall no longer walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
18 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers as a heritage.


19 I said, ‘How I would set you among my sons and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful heritage of the nations!’ And I said, ‘You will call me, My Father, and not turn away from following me.’
20 Surely, as a wife treacherously leaves her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel,” declares the LORD.


21 A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and pleading of the sons of Israel, because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten the LORD their God.
22 “Return, O faithless sons; I will heal your faithlessness.” “Behold, we come to you, for you are the LORD our God.
23 Truly the hills are a delusion, the tumult on the mountains. Truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.
24 But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth—their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
25 Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us. For we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.”




Chapter 4


1 “If you return, O Israel,” declares the LORD, “if you return to me, if you remove your abominations from before me, and do not waver,
2 and if you swear, ‘As the LORD lives,’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him they shall glory.”


3 For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem: “Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns.
4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, remove the foreskins of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of the vileness of your deeds.”


5 Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say: “Blow the trumpet in the land; cry aloud and say, ‘Assemble, and let us go into the fortified cities!’
6 Raise a standard toward Zion, flee for safety, do not delay, for I am bringing disaster from the north, great destruction.
7 A lion has come up from his thicket, a destroyer of nations has set out; he has gone forth from his place to make your land a waste; your cities will be ruins without inhabitant.
8 For this put on sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned back from us.”


9 And it shall come to pass in that day, declares the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes, and the priests shall be appalled, and the prophets shall be astounded.
10 Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You shall have peace,’ whereas the sword reaches to the very soul.”


11 At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A scorching wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow and not to cleanse,
12 a wind too full for these things, shall come at my command. Now I myself will speak judgment against them.”


13 Behold, he comes up like clouds, his chariots like the whirlwind, his horses swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are ruined!
14 O Jerusalem, wash your heart from evil, that you may be saved. How long shall your wicked thoughts lodge within you?
15 For a voice declares from Dan, and proclaims trouble from the hills of Ephraim.
16 Make it known to the nations, behold, proclaim against Jerusalem, “Besiegers are coming from a distant land, and they raise their voice against the cities of Judah.
17 Like keepers of a field they are against her all around, because she has rebelled against me,” declares the LORD.


18 Your ways and your deeds have brought this upon you; this is your evil; how bitter, how it has reached to your heart.


19 My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain. O walls of my heart! My heart is pounding within me; I cannot keep silent, for I hear the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
20 Crash follows upon crash; for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are laid waste, my curtains in a moment.
21 How long must I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?
22 “For my people are foolish; they do not know me; they are stupid children; they have no understanding. They are skilled in doing evil, but how to do good they do not know.”


23 I looked on the earth, and behold, it was formless and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.
24 I looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, and all the hills moved to and fro.
25 I looked, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.
26 I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a wilderness, and all its cities were torn down before the LORD, before his fierce anger.


27 For thus says the LORD, “The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.
28 For this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above be dark, because I have spoken, I have purposed; I will not relent nor will I turn back from it.”


29 At the sound of horsemen and archers every city flees; they go into the thickets, they climb among the rocks; every city is forsaken, and no man dwells in them.
30 And you, O desolate one, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in vain you beautify yourself. Your lovers despise you; they seek your life.
31 For I heard a cry like that of a woman in labor, anguish as of one giving birth to her first child—the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands: “Woe is me! For I am fainting before murderers.”




Chapter 5


1 Roam about through the streets of Jerusalem, look and take note, search in her open places, if you can find a man, if there is one who does justice, who seeks truth, then I will pardon her.
2 Though they say, “As the LORD lives,” surely they swear falsely.
3 O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? You struck them, but they felt no pain; you consumed them, but they refused to accept discipline. They made their faces harder than rock; they refused to turn back.


4 Then I said, “Surely these are the poor; they are foolish, for they do not know the way of the LORD, the judgment of their God.
5 I will go to the great and speak to them, for they know the way of the LORD, the judgment of their God.” But they all alike had broken the yoke; they had torn off the bonds.
6 Therefore a lion from the forest strikes them down, a wolf of the deserts ravages them, a leopard watches over their cities. Everyone who goes out from them shall be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many, their apostasies are great.


7 “Why should I pardon you? Your sons have forsaken me and sworn by those who are not gods. When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery and trooped to the house of harlots.
8 They were well-fed lusty stallions, each neighing after his neighbor’s wife.
9 Shall I not punish them for these things?” declares the LORD. “Shall I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?”


10 “Go up through her rows of vines and destroy, but do not make a full end; strip away her branches, for they are not the LORD’s.
11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly treacherous toward me,” declares the LORD.
12 They have lied about the LORD and said, “It is not he; no disaster will come upon us, nor shall we see sword or famine.
13 The prophets are but wind, and the word is not in them. Thus it shall be done to them!”


14 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts: “Because you have spoken this word, I am making my words in your mouth a fire, and this people wood, and it shall consume them.
15 See how I am bringing against you a nation from afar, O house of Israel,” declares the LORD. “It is an enduring nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor can you understand what they say.
16 Their quiver is like an open tomb; they are all mighty men.
17 They shall eat up your harvest and your food; they shall eat up your sons and your daughters; they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees; with the sword they shall demolish your fortified cities in which you trust.


18 Yet even in those days,” declares the LORD, “I will not make a full end of you.
19 And when they say, ‘Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?’ then you shall say to them, ‘As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.’”


20 Declare this in the house of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah, saying,
21 “Hear this, O foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but see not, who have ears but hear not.
22 Do you not fear me?” declares the LORD. “Do you not tremble before me? I placed the sand as the boundary for the sea, an everlasting decree that it cannot pass. Though its waves toss, they cannot prevail; though they roar, they cannot cross over it.
23 But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and gone away.
24 They do not say in their heart, ‘Let us fear the LORD our God, who gives the rain, both the early and the latter, in its season, who keeps for us the appointed weeks of harvest.’
25 Your iniquities have turned these away, and your sins have withheld good from you.


26 For wicked men are found among my people; they lurk like fowlers lying in wait; they set a trap, they catch men.
27 Like a cage full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit; therefore they have become great and rich.
28 They have grown fat and sleek. They also excel in deeds of wickedness; they do not plead the cause, the cause of the orphan, that they may prosper; and they do not defend the right of the needy.
29 Shall I not punish them for these things?” declares the LORD. “Shall I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?”


30 An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land:
31 the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule at their own direction. My people love to have it so, but what will you do at the end of it?




Chapter 6


1 Flee for safety, O sons of Benjamin, from the midst of Jerusalem! Blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise a signal over Beth-haccherem, for disaster looms from the north, great destruction.
2 The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, I will cut off.
3 Shepherds with their flocks shall come against her; they shall pitch their tents around her, each shall pasture in his place.


4 “Prepare war against her; arise, and let us attack at noon! Woe to us, for the day declines, for the shadows of evening lengthen!
5 Arise, and let us attack by night, and destroy her palaces!”
6 For thus says the LORD of hosts: “Cut down her trees, and cast up a siege mound against Jerusalem. This is the city to be punished; there is nothing but oppression within her.
7 As a well keeps its waters fresh, so she keeps her wickedness fresh. Violence and destruction are heard in her; sickness and wounds are ever before me.
8 Be warned, O Jerusalem, lest I turn from you in disgust, lest I make you a desolation, an uninhabited land.”


9 Thus says the LORD of hosts: “They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine; turn back your hand again, like a grape gatherer, over the branches.”
10 To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? See how their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot listen? Observe how the word of the LORD is to them an object of scorn; they take no pleasure in it.
11 But I am full of the wrath of the LORD; I am weary of holding it in. “Pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the gatherings of young men also; for both husband and wife shall be taken, the old and the very aged.
12 Their houses shall be turned over to others, their fields and wives together, for I will stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land,” declares the LORD.
13 “For from the least of them to the greatest, everyone is greedy for unjust gain; and from prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.
14 They have healed the wound of my people lightly, saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ when there is no peace.
15 Were they ashamed when they committed abominations? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall stumble,” says the LORD.


16 Thus says the LORD: “Stand by the roads and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is, and walk in it, and find rest for your souls. But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’
17 I set watchmen over you, saying, ‘Pay attention to the sound of the trumpet!’ But they said, ‘We will not pay attention.’
18 Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O congregation, what will happen to them.
19 Hear, O earth; I am bringing disaster upon this people, the fruit of their schemes, because they have not paid attention to my words, and as for my law, they have rejected it.
20 What use to me is frankincense that comes from Sheba, or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me.”


21 Therefore thus says the LORD: “I will lay before this people stumbling blocks, against which fathers and sons together shall stumble; neighbor and friend shall perish.”
22 Thus says the LORD: “A people is coming from the land of the north, a great nation is stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.
23 They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, arrayed as a man for battle against you, O daughter of Zion!”
24 We have heard the report of it; our hands grow feeble; anguish has seized us, pain as of a woman in labor.
25 Do not go out into the field, nor walk on the road, for the enemy has a sword; terror is on every side.


26 O daughter of my people, put on sackcloth, and roll in ashes; make mourning as for an only son, most bitter lamentation, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.
27 “I have made you a tester of metals among my people, that you may know and test their way.
28 They are all stubbornly rebellious, going about as slanderers; they are bronze and iron; all of them act corruptly.
29 The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed by the fire; in vain the refining goes on, for the wicked are not removed.
30 They are called rejected silver, for the LORD has rejected them.”




Chapter 7


1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
2 Stand in the gate of the house of the LORD, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah, who enter by these gates to worship the LORD.
3 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place.
4 Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, The temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD are these.
5 For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly practice justice between a man and his neighbor,
6 if you do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, nor walk after other gods to your own ruin,
7 then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.


8 Observe and see how you trust in deceptive words to no avail.
9 Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods that you have not known,
10 and then come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My name, and say, We are delivered—so that you may continue to do all these abominations?
11 Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of robbers in your sight? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, declares the LORD.
12 But go now to My place that was in Shiloh, where I made My name dwell at the first, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel.
13 And now, because you have done all these deeds, declares the LORD, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you did not listen, and I called you but you did not answer,
14 therefore I will do to the house that is called by My name, in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
15 And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, the whole seed of Ephraim.


16 As for you, do not pray for this people, nor lift up cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with Me, for I will not hear you.
17 Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
18 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke Me to anger.
19 Do they provoke Me to anger? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves, to their own shame?
20 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, My anger and My wrath will be poured out on this place, on man, on beast, on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it will burn and not be quenched.


21 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat the flesh.
22 For I did not speak with your fathers or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.
23 But this thing I commanded them, saying, Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you will be My people; and walk in all the way that I command you, that it may go well with you.
24 But they did not listen or incline their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward.
25 From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending them.
26 Yet they did not listen to Me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck; they did worse than their fathers.
27 You shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; you shall call to them, but they will not answer you.
28 And you shall say to them, This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, nor receive correction. Truth has perished and is cut off from their mouth.


29 Cut off your hair and cast it away, and lift up a lamentation on the bare heights; for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.
30 For the sons of Judah have done evil in My sight, declares the LORD; they have set their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.
31 They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come into My mind.
32 Therefore, observe how the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no more place.
33 And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth, and no one will frighten them away.
34 Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a desolation.




Chapter 8


1 At that time, declares the LORD, they will bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, from their graves.
2 And they will spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and to which they have bowed down. They will not be gathered or buried; they will be as dung on the face of the ground.
3 And death will be chosen rather than life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family, that remain in all the places where I have driven them, declares the LORD of hosts.


4 And you shall say to them, Thus says the LORD: Do men fall and not rise up again? Does one turn away and not return?
5 Why then has this people of Jerusalem turned away in perpetual backsliding? They hold fast to deceit, they refuse to return.
6 I listened and heard, but they do not speak what is right; no man repents of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Everyone turns to his own course, like a horse plunging headlong into battle.
7 Even the stork in the heavens knows her appointed times; and the turtledove, and the swallow, and the crane keep the time of their coming; but My people do not know the judgment of the LORD.


8 How can you say, "We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us," when you can see the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.
9 The wise men are put to shame, they are dismayed and caught. They have rejected the word of the LORD, and what wisdom do they have?
10 Therefore I will give their wives to others, their fields to those who will inherit them; for from the least even to the greatest, everyone is greedy for gain; from the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely.
11 They have healed the wound of the daughter of My people lightly, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.
12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, and they did not know how to blush. Therefore they will fall among those who fall; "in the time of their punishment they will be cast down," says the LORD.
13 "I will utterly consume them," declares the LORD; "no grapes will be on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf will wither, and what I have given them will pass away from them."


14 Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter the fortified cities, and let us be silent there; for the LORD our God has silenced us, and given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
15 We looked for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, terror.
16 The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighing of his stallions the whole land trembles; for they come and devour the land and all that is in it, the city and those who dwell in it.
17 For behold, I am sending among you serpents, adders that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you, declares the LORD.


18 My comfort in sorrow is faint within me; my heart is sick within me.
19 Behold, the cry of the daughter of my people from a land far and wide: Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not within her? Why have they provoked Me to anger with their carved images, with foreign vanities?
20 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
21 For the wound of the daughter of my people I am crushed; I mourn, dismay has taken hold of me.
22 Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the healing of the daughter of my people not come about?




Chapter 9


1 Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
2 Oh that I had in the desert a lodging place for travelers, that I might leave my people and go from them! For they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
3 They bend their tongue like their bow for lies; but they are not valiant for truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know Me, declares the LORD.


4 Beware of your neighbor, and put no trust in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor goes about as a slanderer.
5 Everyone deceives his neighbor, and does not speak the truth; they have taught their tongue to speak lies, they weary themselves committing iniquity.
6 Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know Me, declares the LORD.


7 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: "I will refine them and test them; for what else can I do because of the daughter of My people?
8 Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit; with his mouth one speaks peace to his neighbor, but in his heart he lays in wait for him."
9 "Shall I not punish them for these things?" declares the LORD. "Shall I not avenge Myself on a nation such as this?"


10 For the mountains I will lift up weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lament, because they are laid waste so that no one passes through, and the sound of the livestock is not heard; both the birds of the heavens and the beasts have fled, they are gone.
11 And I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.


12 Who is the man so wise that he may understand this? And to whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined and laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?
13 And the LORD said, "Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice or walked according to it,
14 but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart and after the Baals, as their fathers taught them,"
15 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "I will feed them, this people, with wormwood, and give them poisoned water to drink.
16 I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them until I have consumed them."


17 Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Consider, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skillful women, that they may come."
18 Let them make haste and lift up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush with water.
19 For the sound of wailing is heard from Zion: "How we are ruined! We are greatly ashamed, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings."
20 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O women, and let your ear receive the word of His mouth; teach your daughters wailing, and every neighbor her lament.
21 For death has climbed through our windows, it has entered our palaces, to cut off the children from the streets, the young men from the squares.
22 Speak, "Thus declares the LORD: 'The dead bodies of men will fall like dung on the open field, and like sheaves after the reaper, and no one will gather them.'"


23 Thus says the LORD: "Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches."
24 "But let him who boasts, boast in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth; for in these I delight," declares the LORD.


25 "Look! The days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh—
26 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and all who dwell in the wilderness who clip the corners of their hair; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart."




Chapter 10


1 Hear the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.
2 Thus says the LORD: "Do not learn the way of the nations, and do not be terrified by the signs of the heavens, though the nations are terrified by them."
3 For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cuts a tree from the forest, the work of the hands of a craftsman with the axe.
4 They decorate it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and hammers so that it does not totter.
5 They are like a scarecrow in a cucumber field, and they cannot speak; they must be carried, because they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.


6 There is none like You, O LORD; You are great, and Your name is great in might.
7 Who would not fear You, O King of the nations? For this is Your due. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like You.
8 They are altogether dull and foolish; instruction from idols is wood.
9 Silver beaten into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith. Their clothing is blue and purple; they are all the work of skilled men.
10 But the LORD is the true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth trembles, and the nations cannot endure His indignation.


11 Thus you shall say to them: "The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens."


12 It is He who made the earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom, and by His understanding stretched out the heavens.
13 When He utters His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain, and brings out the wind from His storehouses.
14 Every man is stupid and without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his idol; for his molten image is a lie, and there is no breath in them.
15 They are vanity, a work of delusion; in the time of their punishment they will perish.
16 The Portion of Jacob is not like these; for He is the one who formed all things, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; the LORD of hosts is His name.


17 Gather up your bundle from the ground, you who dwell under siege.
18 For thus says the LORD: At this time I will sling out the inhabitants of the land, and will distress them, that they may find it so.
19 Woe is me because of my hurt! My wound is severe. But I said, Truly this is my sickness, and I must bear it.
20 My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken; my children have gone from me, and they are no more; there is no one to stretch out my tent again or to set up my curtains.
21 For the shepherds are stupid and do not seek the LORD; therefore they have not prospered, and all their flock is scattered.
22 A sound of rumor!—it comes, and a great commotion out of the land of the north, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a haunt of jackals.


23 I know, O LORD, that the way of a man is not in himself; it is not in man who walks, to be able to direct his own steps.
24 Correct me, O LORD, but in justice; not in Your anger, lest You bring me to nothing.
25 Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You, and on the families that do not call on Your name; for they have devoured Jacob, yes, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.




Chapter 11


1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
2 “Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
3 You shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Cursed is the man who does not hear the words of this covenant,
4 which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, "Obey My voice and do all that I command you; so you will be My people, and I will be your God,
5 that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day."’” Then I answered and said, “Amen, O LORD.”


6 And the LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant and do them.
7 For I solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and warning, saying, "Obey My voice."
8 Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. So I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.’”


9 And the LORD said to me, “A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
10 They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers who refused to hear My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.”
11 Therefore thus says the LORD: “I am bringing disaster upon them which they cannot escape; and though they cry out to Me, I will not listen to them.
12 Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense; but they surely will not save them in the time of their disaster.
13 For your gods are as many as your cities, O Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.”


14 “As for you, do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not listen when they call to Me because of their disaster.
15 What right has My beloved in My house, when she has done many vile deeds? Can the flesh of holy offerings remove you from your evil, so that you can rejoice?
16 The LORD once called you a green olive tree, beautiful with good fruit; but with the roar of a great storm He has set fire to it, and its branches are broken.
17 The LORD of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced disaster against you because of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger by burning incense to Baal.”


18 The LORD made it known to me, and I knew; then You showed me their deeds.
19 But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not know that they had devised plots against me, saying, “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name may be remembered no more.”
20 But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, who tests the heart and the mind, let me see Your vengeance upon them; for to You have I committed my cause.


21 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, “Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will die by our hand”—
22 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: “I will punish them; the young men will die by the sword, their sons and their daughters will die by famine,
23 and none of them will be left. For I will bring disaster upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their punishment.”




Chapter 12


1 Righteous are You, O LORD, when I bring a case before You; yet I would speak with You about justice. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are all those at ease who deal treacherously?
2 You have planted them, and they have taken root; they grow, they even bear fruit. You are near in their mouth but far from their heart.
3 But You, O LORD, know me; You see me, and You test my heart toward You. Pull them out like sheep for slaughter, and set them apart for the day of killing.
4 How long will the land mourn, and the grass of every field wither? Because of the evil of those who dwell in it, the beasts and the birds are swept away, because they said, “He will not see our latter end.”


5 “If you have run with footmen and they have wearied you, how then can you contend with horses? And if you fall in a land of peace, how will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?
6 For even your brothers and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; even they have cried aloud after you. Do not believe them, though they speak fair words to you.”


7 “I have forsaken My house, I have abandoned My heritage; I have given the beloved of My soul into the hand of her enemies.
8 My heritage has become to Me like a lion in the forest; she has roared against Me, therefore I hate her.
9 Is My heritage to Me like a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her all around? Go, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.
10 Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard, they have trampled My portion underfoot, they have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
11 They have made it a desolation; desolate, it mourns before Me. The whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.
12 Destroyers have come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of the LORD devours from one end of the land even to the other; no flesh has peace.
13 They have sown wheat but have reaped thorns; they have worn themselves out but gain nothing. They are ashamed of their harvests because of the fierce anger of the LORD.”


14 Thus says the LORD concerning all My evil neighbors who touch the inheritance that I have caused My people Israel to inherit: “I am about to uproot them from their land, and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them.
15 And after I have uprooted them, I will again have compassion on them, and I will bring them back each to his heritage and each to his land.
16 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, ‘As the LORD lives,’ even as they taught My people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built up in the midst of My people.
17 But if they will not listen, I will utterly uproot and destroy that nation, declares the LORD.”




Chapter 13


1 Thus the LORD said to me: “Go and buy yourself a linen loincloth, and put it around your waist, but do not put it in water.”
2 So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the LORD and put it around my waist.
3 And the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying,
4 “Take the loincloth that you bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.”
5 So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
6 And it came to pass after many days that the LORD said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.”
7 So I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And the loincloth was ruined; it was good for nothing.


8 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
9 “Thus says the LORD: In this way I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
10 This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and who have gone after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, shall be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing.
11 For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I caused all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah to cling to me—declares the LORD—to be my people, for renown, for praise, and for glory, but they did not listen.”


12 “Therefore you shall speak to them this word: ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Every jar shall be filled with wine.’ And when they say to you, ‘Do we not indeed know that every jar shall be filled with wine?’
13 Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: Look here, I am about to fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land—the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
14 And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together—declares the LORD. I will not show pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.’”


15 Hear and give ear; do not be proud, for the LORD has spoken.
16 Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness, and before your feet stumble on the mountains at twilight; while you look for light, he turns it into gloom and makes it deep darkness.
17 But if you will not listen, my soul will weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, because the flock of the LORD has been taken captive.


18 Say to the king and to the queen mother:
“Sit down low,
for your crown of glory
has come down from your head.”


19 The cities of the Negev are shut up, with no one to open them; all Judah is taken into exile, wholly taken into exile.
20 Lift up your eyes and see
those who come from the north.
Where is the flock that was given you,
your beautiful sheep?


21 What will you say when he sets over you—
those you yourself taught to be allies for your head?
Will not pangs take hold of you,
like a woman in labor?
22 And if you say in your heart,
“Why have these things come upon me?”
For the greatness of your iniquity
your skirts are uncovered,
and your heels suffer violence.
23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin,
or the leopard his spots?
Then you also can do good
who are accustomed to doing evil.


24 So I will scatter them like chaff
driven by the wind of the wilderness.
25 This is your lot,
the portion measured to you from me—
declares the LORD—
because you have forgotten me
and trusted in lies.
26 I myself will also lift up your skirts over your face,
that your shame may be seen.
27 Your adulteries and your lustful neighings,
the lewdness of your whoredom,
on the hills in the field I have seen.
Woe to you, Jerusalem!
How long will you remain unclean?




Chapter 14


1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts.


2 Judah mourns, and her gates languish; they sit in mourning on the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem goes up.
3 Their nobles send their servants for water; they come to the cisterns, they find no water. They return with their vessels empty, ashamed and humiliated, and they cover their heads.
4 Because the ground is cracked, for there has been no rain in the land, the farmers are ashamed; they cover their heads.
5 Even the doe in the field gives birth and abandons her young, because there is no grass.
6 The wild donkeys stand on the barren heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, for there is no vegetation.


7 Though our iniquities testify against us, act, O LORD, for Your name’s sake. For our apostasies are many; we have sinned against You.
8 O Hope of Israel, its Savior in time of distress, why should You be like a stranger in the land, like a traveler who turns aside to spend only the night?
9 Why should You be like a man confused, like a mighty man unable to save? Yet You, O LORD, are in our midst, and Your name has been called upon us; do not leave us.


10 Thus says the LORD concerning this people: “They have loved to wander; they have not restrained their feet. Therefore the LORD does not accept them; now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins.”


11 And the LORD said to me, “Do not pray for the welfare of this people.
12 Though they fast, I will not listen to their cry; though they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence I will consume them.”


13 Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! See, the prophets are saying to them, ‘You will not see the sword, nor will you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.’”
14 And the LORD said to me, “The prophets are prophesying lies in My name. I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own mind.
15 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name though I did not send them, yet they say, ‘Sword and famine will not be in this land’—by sword and famine those prophets shall perish.
16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of famine and sword, with none to bury them, them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters. I will pour out their evil upon them.”


17 And you shall say this word to them:
“Let my eyes run with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for the virgin daughter of my people is crushed with a great wound, with a very grievous blow.
18 If I go out into the field, there are those slain by the sword; and if I enter the city, there are those wasted with famine. For both prophet and priest roam about the land, and they do not know what they are doing.”


19 Have You utterly rejected Judah? Has Your soul loathed Zion? Why have You struck us so that there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but nothing good came; for a time of healing, but only saw terror.
20 We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, the iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against You.
21 Do not spurn us, for Your name’s sake; do not dishonor Your glorious throne; remember, and do not break Your covenant with us.
22 Are there any among the worthless idols of the nations who bring rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Is it not You, O LORD our God? Therefore we hope in You, for You are the one who does all these things.




Chapter 15


1 And the LORD said to me, “Even though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, My soul would not turn toward this people. Send them away from My presence, and let them go.
2 And if they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’ then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD:
Those destined for death, to death;
those destined for the sword, to the sword;
those destined for famine, to famine;
and those destined for captivity, to captivity.’


3 I will appoint over them four kinds of doom, declares the LORD: the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
4 And I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.


5 For who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem, or who will grieve for you? Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?
6 You have rejected Me, declares the LORD; you keep going backward. So I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you; I am weary of relenting.
7 I will winnow them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy My people, for they did not turn from their ways.
8 Their widows became more numerous to Me than the sand of the seas; I brought against the mother of young men a destroyer at noonday. I made anguish and terror fall upon her suddenly.
9 She who bore seven languishes; she has breathed out her life. Her sun went down while it was yet day; she has been shamed and humiliated. And their remnant I will give to the sword before their enemies, declares the LORD.”


10 Woe to me, my mother, that you bore me, a man of strife and a man of contention to all the land! I have not lent, nor have men lent to me, yet everyone curses me.
11 The LORD said, “Surely I will deliver you for good; surely I will make your enemies plead with you in the time of disaster and in the time of distress.
12 Can one break iron, iron from the north, and bronze?
13 Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder without price, for all your sins throughout your borders.
14 I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for a fire is kindled in My anger; it will burn upon you.”


15 You know, O LORD; remember me and visit me, and take vengeance for me on my persecutors. In Your patience, do not take me away; know that for Your sake I bear reproach.
16 Your words were found, and I ate them, and Your word was to me the joy and delight of my heart, for I am called by Your name, O LORD God of hosts.
17 I did not sit in the company of merrymakers, nor did I rejoice; I sat alone because of Your hand, for You had filled me with indignation.
18 Why is my pain unending, and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Will You indeed be to me like a deceptive stream, like waters that are not reliable?


19 Therefore thus says the LORD:
“If you return, I will restore you, and you shall stand before Me.
If you utter what is precious and not what is worthless, you shall be as My mouth.
They shall turn to you, but you shall not turn to them.
20 And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze;
they will fight against you, but they shall not prevail over you,
for I am with you to save you and deliver you, declares the LORD.
21 I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked,
and I will redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless.”




Chapter 16


1 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “You shall not take a wife for yourself, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place.”
3 For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bear them, and their fathers who beget them in this land:
4 “They shall die of deadly diseases; they shall not be mourned, nor shall they be buried. They shall be like dung on the face of the ground. They shall perish by sword and famine, and their carcasses shall be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.”


5 For thus says the LORD: “Do not enter the house of mourning, nor go to lament or grieve for them, for I have taken away My peace from this people, declares the LORD, My steadfast love and mercy.
6 Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, and men shall not mourn for them, nor cut themselves, nor shave their heads for them.
7 They shall not break bread for the mourner to comfort him for the dead, nor shall they give him the cup of consolation to drink for his father or his mother.


8 And do not enter the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and drink.
9 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “I am about to cause to cease from this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.”


10 And when you declare to this people all these words, and they say to you, “Why has the LORD pronounced all this great disaster against us? What is our iniquity? What is the sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?”—
11 then you shall say to them, “Because your fathers have forsaken Me, declares the LORD, and have gone after other gods and served them and bowed down to them, but Me they have forsaken and My law they have not kept.
12 And you have done worse than your fathers, for every one of you follows the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that you do not listen to Me.
13 Therefore I will hurl you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.”


14 “Therefore, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it will no longer be said, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,’
15 but, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where He had driven them.’ For I will bring them back to their land that I gave to their fathers.


16 Look, I am sending for many fishermen, declares the LORD, and they shall fish them out; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
17 For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity concealed from My eyes.
18 But first I will doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted My land with the carcasses of their detestable idols and have filled My inheritance with their abominations.”


19 O LORD, my strength and my stronghold, my refuge in the day of distress, to You shall the nations come from the ends of the earth and say,
“Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, worthless things in which there is no profit.
20 Can man make gods for himself? Yet they are no gods!”


21 “Therefore, behold, I will make them know, this once I will make them know My hand and My might, and they shall know that My name is the LORD.”




Chapter 17


1 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron; with a point of diamond it is engraved on the tablet of their heart and on the horns of their altars,
2 while their children remember their altars and their Asherim beside every green tree and on the high hills,
3 on the mountains in the open country. Your wealth and all your treasures I will give as plunder, along with your high places, because of sin throughout all your territory.
4 You shall let go of your heritage that I gave you; I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, for you have kindled a fire in My anger; it will burn forever.


5 Thus says the LORD:
“Cursed is the man who trusts in man
and makes flesh his strength,
and whose heart turns away from the LORD.
6 He will be like a shrub in the desert,
and shall not see when good comes.
He will dwell in the parched places of the wilderness,
in a salt land where no one lives.


7 Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD,
and whose trust is the LORD.
8 He will be like a tree planted by the water,
that sends out its roots by the stream.
It does not fear when heat comes,
for its leaves remain green.
It is not anxious in the year of drought,
nor does it cease to bear fruit.”


9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and incurable—who can understand it?
10 I, the LORD, search the heart and test the mind, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds.


11 Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay is the one who gains wealth unjustly. In the middle of his days it will desert him, and at his end he will be a fool.


12 A glorious throne set on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.
13 O LORD, the hope of Israel, all who forsake You shall be put to shame; those who turn away from You shall be written in the dust, for they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living water.


14 Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for You are my praise.
15 Look how they keep saying to me, “Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come now!”
16 But I have not run away from being a shepherd who follows You, nor have I desired the day of disaster. You know what came out of my lips; it was before You.
17 Do not be a terror to me; You are my refuge in the day of disaster.
18 Let my persecutors be put to shame, but do not let me be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but do not let me be dismayed. Bring upon them the day of disaster; crush them with double destruction.


19 Thus said the LORD to me: “Go and stand in the gate of the sons of the people, through which the kings of Judah come in and through which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem,
20 and say to them, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and all Judah, and all inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates.
21 Thus says the LORD: Take care for the sake of your lives, and do not carry a burden on the Sabbath day or bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.
22 And do not carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day or do any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers.
23 Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck, that they might not hear and not receive instruction.


24 But if you diligently listen to Me, declares the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but keep the Sabbath day holy and do no work on it,
25 then kings and princes who sit on the throne of David shall enter through the gates of this city, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city shall be inhabited forever.
26 And they shall come from the cities of Judah and the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the Shephelah, from the hill country, and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and frankincense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the LORD.
27 But if you do not listen to Me, to keep the Sabbath day holy and not to carry a burden when you enter the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem and not be quenched.’”




Chapter 18


1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
2 “Arise and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will let you hear My words.”
3 So I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was working at the wheel.
4 But the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter, so he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make.


5 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
6 “O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? declares the LORD. Like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel.
7 At one moment I may speak concerning a nation or a kingdom, to pluck up and break down and destroy it,
8 but if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it.
9 And at another moment I may speak concerning a nation or a kingdom, to build and to plant it,
10 but if it does evil in My sight, not listening to My voice, then I will relent of the good with which I had intended to bless it.


11 Now therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: ‘Thus says the LORD: I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Turn back, each of you from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds.’
12 But they say, ‘It is hopeless, for we will follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’


13 Therefore thus says the LORD:
“Ask now among the nations,
Who has heard such things?
The virgin Israel has done
a most horrible thing.
14 Does the snow of Lebanon leave
the crags of Sirion?
Do the cold flowing waters
from afar ever run dry?
15 Yet My people have forgotten Me;
they burn offerings to worthless idols.
They have stumbled in their ways,
in the ancient paths,
to walk in byways,
not on the highway,
16 making their land a horror,
a thing to be hissed at forever.
Everyone who passes by it is appalled
and shakes his head.
17 Like the east wind I will scatter them
before the enemy.
I will show them My back, not My face,
in the day of their disaster.”


18 Then they said, “Come, let us devise plans against Jeremiah, for the law will not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words.”


19 Give attention to me, O LORD, and hear the voice of my adversaries.
20 Shall evil be repaid for good? Yet they have dug a pit for my life. Remember how I stood before You to speak good for them, to turn away Your wrath from them.
21 Therefore give their children to famine; hand them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives be bereaved of children and widows; let their men be struck down by death, their young men struck down by the sword in battle.
22 Let a cry be heard from their houses when You bring a raiding party suddenly upon them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and laid snares for my feet.
23 But You, O LORD, know all their plans to kill me. Do not forgive their iniquity or blot out their sin from Your sight. Let them be overthrown before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.




Chapter 19


1 Thus says the LORD: “Go, buy a potter’s earthenware flask, and take some of the elders of the people and some of the elders of the priests,
2 and go out to the Valley of Ben-hinnom, which is at the entrance of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the words that I speak to you.
3 You shall say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Look! I am bringing disaster upon this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.
4 Because they have forsaken Me and have made this place foreign, and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods that neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and because they have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
5 and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal—which I did not command or decree, nor did it come into My mind—
6 therefore, look how the days are coming, declares the LORD, when this place shall no longer be called Topheth, or the Valley of Ben-hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.


7 And in this place I will make void the plans of Judah and Jerusalem, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their carcasses as food to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.
8 And I will make this city a horror, a thing to be hissed at. Everyone who passes by it will be appalled and hiss because of all its wounds.
9 And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and each shall eat the flesh of his neighbor in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who seek their life afflict them.’


10 “Then you shall break the flask in the sight of the men who go with you,
11 and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: So will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter’s vessel, so that it cannot be mended. They shall bury in Topheth because there will be no other place to bury.
12 Thus will I do to this place, declares the LORD, and to its inhabitants, making this city like Topheth.
13 The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah—all the houses on whose roofs offerings have been burned to all the host of heaven, and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods—shall be defiled like the place of Topheth.’”


14 Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the LORD’s house and said to all the people,
15 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Look! I am bringing upon this city and upon all its towns all the disaster that I have pronounced against it, because they have stiffened their neck, refusing to hear My words.”




Chapter 20


1 Now Pashhur son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
2 Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Benjamin Gate of the house of the LORD.
3 But on the next day, when Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The LORD does not call your name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.
4 For thus says the LORD: You will see how I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies before your eyes, and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He shall carry them captive to Babylon and shall strike them down with the sword.
5 Moreover, I will give all the wealth of this city, all its gains, all its prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies. They shall plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon.
6 And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house shall go into captivity. You shall go to Babylon, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied lies.”


7 O LORD, You have enticed me, and I was enticed;
You are stronger than I, and You prevailed.
I have become a laughingstock all the day;
everyone mocks me.
8 For whenever I speak, I cry out,
I shout, “Violence and destruction!”
For the word of the LORD has become for me
a reproach and derision all the day.
9 If I say, “I will not mention Him,
or speak any more in His name,”
there is in my heart as it were a burning fire
shut up in my bones,
and I am weary with holding it in,
and I cannot.


10 For I hear many whispering.
“Terror is all around!
Denounce him! Let us denounce him!”
say all my close friends,
watching for my fall.
“Perhaps he will be deceived;
then we can overcome him
and take our revenge on him.”


11 But the LORD is with me as a dread warrior;
therefore my persecutors will stumble;
they will not prevail.
They will be greatly shamed,
for they will not succeed.
Their eternal dishonor
will never be forgotten.
12 O LORD of hosts, who tests the righteous,
who sees the heart and the mind,
let me see Your vengeance upon them,
for to You I have committed my cause.


13 Sing to the LORD;
praise the LORD!
For He has delivered the life of the needy
from the hand of evildoers.


14 Cursed be the day on which I was born!
The day when my mother bore me,
let it not be blessed!
15 Cursed be the man who brought the news
to my father, “A son is born to you,”
making him very glad.
16 Let that man be like the cities
that the LORD overthrew without pity;
let him hear a cry in the morning
and an alarm at noon,
17 because he did not kill me in the womb;
so my mother would have been my grave,
and her womb forever pregnant.
18 Why did I come out from the womb
to see toil and sorrow,
and spend my days in shame?




Chapter 21


Chapter 22


1 Thus says the LORD: “Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
2 and say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David—you, and your servants, and your people who enter these gates.
3 Thus says the LORD: Do justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place.
4 For if you indeed do this thing, then kings who sit on David’s throne will enter through the gates of this house, riding in chariot and on horses, he and his servants and his people.
5 But if you will not listen to these words, I swear by myself—declares the LORD—that this house shall become a ruin.’”


6 For thus says the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah:
“You are Gilead to me,
the summit of Lebanon,
yet surely I will make you a wilderness,
cities without inhabitant.
7 I will prepare destroyers against you,
each with his weapons,
and they will cut down your choice cedars
and throw them into the fire.”


8 And many nations will pass by this city, and each man will say to his neighbor, “Why has the LORD dealt in this way with this great city?”
9 And they will answer, “Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD their God and worshiped other gods and served them.”


10 Do not weep for the dead,
and do not mourn for him,
but weep bitterly for him who goes away,
for he shall return no more
and see the land of his birth.
11 For thus says the LORD concerning Shallum son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went out from this place: “He shall not return here anymore,
12 but in the place where they carried him captive, there shall he die, and he shall not see this land again.”


13 Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness,
and his upper rooms by injustice,
who makes his neighbor serve him for nothing
and does not give him his wages,
14 who says, “I will build myself a great house
with spacious upper rooms,”
who cuts out windows for it,
paneling it with cedar
and painting it with vermilion.


15 Do you think you are a king
because you compete in cedar?
Did not your father eat and drink
and do justice and righteousness?
Then it went well with him.
16 He judged the cause of the poor and needy;
then it went well.
Is not this to know me?
declares the LORD.


17 But your eyes and your heart
are set only on your covetousness,
and on shedding innocent blood,
and on practicing oppression and violence.
18 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:
“They shall not lament for him, saying,
‘Ah, my brother!’ or ‘Ah, sister!’
They shall not lament for him, saying,
‘Ah, lord!’ or ‘Ah, his majesty!’
19 With the burial of a donkey he shall be buried—
dragged and thrown out
beyond the gates of Jerusalem.”


20 Go up to Lebanon and cry out,
and lift up your voice in Bashan,
and cry out from Abarim,
for all your lovers are destroyed.
21 I spoke to you in your prosperity,
but you said, “I will not listen.”
This has been your way from your youth,
that you have not obeyed my voice.


22 The wind shall shepherd away all your shepherds,
and your lovers shall go into captivity.
Then you will be ashamed and confounded
because of all your wickedness.
23 O inhabitant of Lebanon,
nested among the cedars,
how you will groan when pangs come upon you,
pain as of a woman in labor!


24 “As I live,” declares the LORD, “though Coniah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off
25 and give you into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand of those whom you fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
26 And I will hurl you and your mother who bore you into another land, where you were not born, and there you shall die.
27 But to the land to which they long to return, there they shall not return.”


28 Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered jar?
Is he a vessel no one delights in?
Why are he and his children hurled out
and cast into a land that they do not know?
29 O land, land, land,
hear the word of the LORD!
30 Thus says the LORD:
“Write this man down as childless,
a man who shall not prosper in his days,
for none of his offspring shall prosper,
sitting on the throne of David
and ruling again in Judah.”




Chapter 23


1 “Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” declares the LORD.
2 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: “You have scattered my flock and driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for the evil of your deeds—declares the LORD.
3 Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
4 And I will set shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, nor shall any be missing—declares the LORD.”


5 “The days are coming—declares the LORD—
when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch,
and he shall reign as king and deal wisely,
and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
6 In his days Judah will be saved,
and Israel will dwell securely.
And this is the name by which he will be called:
‘The LORD is our righteousness.’”


7 “Therefore, the days are coming—declares the LORD—when they shall no longer say, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,’
8 but, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had driven them.’ Then they shall dwell in their own land.”


9 Concerning the prophets:
My heart is broken within me;
all my bones tremble.
I am like a drunken man,
like a man overcome by wine,
because of the LORD
and because of his holy words.
10 For the land is full of adulterers;
because of the curse the land mourns,
and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up.
Their course is evil,
and their might is not right.
11 “Both prophet and priest are ungodly;
even in my house I have found their evil—
declares the LORD.


12 Therefore their way shall be to them
like slippery paths in the darkness;
they shall be driven away and fall in it,
for I will bring disaster upon them
in the year of their punishment—declares the LORD.”


13 In the prophets of Samaria I saw an unsavory thing:
they prophesied by Baal
and led my people Israel astray.
14 But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing:
they commit adultery and walk in lies;
they strengthen the hands of evildoers,
so that no one turns from his evil.
They are all like Sodom to me,
and her inhabitants like Gomorrah.
15 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets:
“Behold, I will feed them with bitter food
and give them poisoned water to drink,
for from the prophets of Jerusalem
ungodliness has gone out into all the land.”


16 Thus says the LORD of hosts:
“Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you,
filling you with empty hopes.
They speak visions of their own minds,
not from the mouth of the LORD.
17 They keep saying to those who despise the word of the LORD,
‘It shall be well with you’;
and to everyone who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say,
‘No disaster shall come upon you.’”
18 For who has stood in the council of the LORD
to see and hear his word,
or who has paid attention to his word and listened?


19 Look! The storm of the LORD!
Wrath has gone forth,
a whirling tempest;
it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
20 The anger of the LORD will not turn back
until he has executed and accomplished
the intents of his heart.
In the latter days you will understand it clearly.
21 “I did not send the prophets,
yet they ran;
I did not speak to them,
yet they prophesied.
22 But if they had stood in my council,
then they would have proclaimed my words to my people,
and they would have turned them from their evil way,
and from the evil of their deeds.”


23 “Am I a God at hand,” declares the LORD,
“and not a God far away?
24 Can a man hide himself in secret places
so that I cannot see him?—declares the LORD.
Do I not fill heaven and earth?—declares the LORD.”


25 “I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’
26 How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,
27 who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell one another, as their fathers forgot my name for Baal?
28 Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with grain?—declares the LORD.
29 Is not my word like fire—declares the LORD—and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?


30 Therefore see how I am against the prophets—declares the LORD—who steal my words from one another.
31 Behold, I am against the prophets—declares the LORD—who use their tongues and declare, ‘Says the LORD.’
32 Pay attention! I am against those who prophesy lying dreams—declares the LORD—and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or command them. So they do not profit this people at all—declares the LORD.”


33 “When this people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of the LORD?’ you shall say to them, ‘You are the burden, and I will cast you off—declares the LORD.’
34 And as for the prophet, priest, or anyone of the people who says, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ I will punish that man and his household.
35 Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
36 But ‘the burden of the LORD’ you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man’s own word, and you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God.
37 Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
38 But if you say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ thus says the LORD: Because you have said these words, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ when I sent to you, saying, ‘You shall not say, “The burden of the LORD,”’
39 therefore, see how I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers.
40 And I will bring upon you everlasting reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.”




Chapter 24


1 The LORD showed me, and there were two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the LORD, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials of Judah, and the craftsmen and the smiths, and had brought them to Babylon from Jerusalem.
2 One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, and the other basket had very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten.


3 The LORD said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” And I said, “Figs—the good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, so bad they cannot be eaten.”


4 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
5 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I regard as good the exiles of Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
6 For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not pull them down; I will plant them and not uproot them.
7 I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the LORD, and they will be my people and I will be their God, for they will return to me with their whole heart.


8 But like the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, surely thus says the LORD, so I will treat Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.
9 I will make them an object of horror, an evil thing to all the kingdoms of the earth—a reproach, a proverb, a taunt, and a curse, in every place where I drive them.
10 I will send the sword, famine, and pestilence against them, until they are destroyed from the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.”




Chapter 25


Chapter 26


1 At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD, saying,
2 “Thus says the LORD: Stand in the court of the house of the LORD, and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the LORD all the words that I command you to speak to them; do not hold back a word.
3 Perhaps they will listen, and every man turn from his evil way, that I may relent of the disaster which I plan to bring on them because of the evil of their deeds.
4 And you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My law which I have set before you,
5 to listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you again and again, though you have not listened,
6 then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.’”


7 The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
8 And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, “You must surely die!
9 Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘This house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant’?” And all the people gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.


10 When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of the LORD and took their seat at the entry of the New Gate of the house of the LORD.
11 Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, “This man deserves the sentence of death, for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.”


12 Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
13 Now therefore amend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will relent of the disaster that He has pronounced against you.
14 But as for me, as you see, I am in your hand; do with me as is good and right in your eyes.
15 Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and on its inhabitants; for truly the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.”


16 Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, “This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.”
17 Then certain of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
18 “Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Zion will be plowed as a field, Jerusalem will become heaps of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.’
19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and the LORD relented of the disaster which He had pronounced against them? But we are about to bring great disaster on ourselves.”


20 There was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land in words like those of Jeremiah.
21 And when King Jehoiakim, with all his mighty men and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and went to Egypt.
22 Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt.
23 They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who struck him down with the sword and cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people.


24 But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hand of the people to be put to death.

1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
2 “Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.”


3 So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites,
4 and I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was beside the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.
5 Then I set before the men of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine and cups, and I said to them, “Drink wine.”


6 But they said, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall never drink wine, neither you nor your sons forever.
7 And you shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed, and you shall not plant a vineyard, nor shall you have any, but you shall live in tents all your days, so that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.’
8 And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, by not drinking wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters,
9 nor building houses to dwell in, nor having vineyard or field or seed.
10 But we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
11 But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, let us go to Jerusalem before the army of the Chaldeans and before the army of Aram.’ So we have lived in Jerusalem.”


12 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
13 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ‘Will you not receive instruction by listening to my words?—declares the LORD.
14 The words of Jonadab son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, have been carried out, and to this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s command. But I have spoken to you persistently, and you have not listened to me.
15 I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, “Turn now every man from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and you will dwell in the land that I gave to you and to your fathers.” But you did not incline your ear or listen to me.
16 The sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have carried out the command of their father that he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me.’


17 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: I am bringing upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem every disaster that I have spoken against them, because I have spoken to them, but they would not listen; and I have called to them, but they would not answer.”


18 But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you,
19 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before me forever.”




Chapter 36


1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
2 “Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah even to this day.
3 Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the disaster that I intend to bring upon them, so that every man may turn from his evil way, and I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”


4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD that he had spoken to him.
5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am shut in; I cannot go into the house of the LORD.
6 So you go, and on a fast day read in the hearing of the people in the house of the LORD the words of the LORD from the scroll that you wrote from my mouth. You shall also read them in the hearing of all Judah who come in from their cities.
7 Perhaps their supplication will fall before the LORD, and every man will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and the wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people.”
8 So Baruch son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the house of the LORD.


9 Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD.
10 Then Baruch read from the scroll the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD’s house, in the hearing of all the people.


11 When Micaiah son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,
12 he went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber, and all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the officials.
13 Then Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.
14 So all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll from which you read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.
15 And they said to him, “Sit down now and read it in our hearing.” So Baruch read it in their hearing.


16 Now it came to pass, when they heard all the words, they turned in fear one to another, and they said to Baruch, “We must surely tell the king all these words.”
17 And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words? Was it from his mouth?”
18 Then Baruch said to them, “He recited all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll.”
19 Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are.”


20 So they went in to the king, into the court, but they had deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they reported all the words in the hearing of the king.
21 Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and in the hearing of all the officials who stood beside the king.
22 Now the king was sitting in the winter house, in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier before him.
23 And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four columns, he cut it with a scribe’s knife and threw it into the fire that was in the brazier, until the whole scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
24 Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words were afraid, nor did they tear their garments.
25 Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
26 Then the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.


27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll and the words that Baruch had written from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
28 “Take again another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned.
29 And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the LORD: You have burned this scroll, saying, “Why have you written in it, saying, The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and will cause man and beast to cease from it?”
30 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night.
31 And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the men of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they did not listen.’”


32 Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch son of Neriah the scribe, who wrote on it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire, and many words like them were added to them.




Chapter 37


1 Zedekiah, son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, reigned instead of Coniah son of Jehoiakim.
2 But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD that he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.


3 King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please pray to the LORD our God for us.”
4 Now Jeremiah was still coming and going among the people, for they had not yet put him in prison.
5 Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt, and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.


6 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
7 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: This is what you shall say to the king of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me: ‘The army of Pharaoh, which came out to help you, is going to return to its own land, to Egypt.
8 And the Chaldeans will come back and fight against this city; they will capture it and burn it with fire.’
9 Thus says the LORD: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, ‘The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,’ for they will not go.
10 Even if you had struck down the whole army of the Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and only wounded men remained among them, every man would rise up in his tent and burn this city with fire.”


11 When the army of the Chaldeans had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army,
12 Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people.
13 But when he was at the Gate of Benjamin, there was a guard there named Irijah son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are going over to the Chaldeans!”
14 Jeremiah said, “That is a lie! I am not going over to the Chaldeans.” But Irijah would not listen to him, so he detained Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
15 The officials were enraged with Jeremiah, and they beat him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for they had made it into a prison.


16 When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon and the cells, and had remained there many days,
17 King Zedekiah sent and took him out, and the king questioned him secretly in his house, and said, “Is there any word from the LORD?” Jeremiah said, “There is.” And he said, “You will be handed over to the king of Babylon.”
18 Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done to you or to your servants or to this people, that you have put me in prison?
19 Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land’?
20 So now, please listen, my lord the king: let my plea come before you. Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.”


21 Then King Zedekiah commanded, and they placed Jeremiah in the court of the guard, and gave him a loaf of bread daily from the Baker’s Street, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.




Chapter 38


1 Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchijah heard the words Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying,
2 “Thus says the LORD: He who stays in this city will die by the sword, by famine, and by plague; but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live—he will have his life as spoil and will live.
3 Thus says the LORD: This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.”
4 Then the officials said to the king, “Let this man be put to death, because he is discouraging the soldiers who remain in this city and all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.”
5 So King Zedekiah said, “He is in your hands, for the king can do nothing against you.”
6 Then they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchijah, the king’s son, which was in the court of the guard, and let Jeremiah down with ropes. Now in the cistern there was no water, only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud.


7 But Ebed-melech the Cushite, a eunuch who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern, while the king was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin.
8 Ebed-melech went out from the king’s house and spoke to the king, saying,
9 “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have thrown into the cistern; and he will die there of hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.”
10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, “Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”
11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went into the king’s house to a place under the treasury, and took from there worn-out rags and torn clothes, and let them down by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
12 Then Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Put these worn-out rags and torn clothes under your armpits under the ropes.” And Jeremiah did so.
13 So they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.


14 Then King Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance to the house of the LORD, and the king said to Jeremiah, “I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me.”
15 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”
16 So King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As the LORD lives, who made this life for us, I will not put you to death, nor will I hand you over to these men who seek your life.”


17 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will indeed go out to the officials of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned with fire, and you and your household will live.
18 But if you do not go out to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you yourself will not escape from their hand.”
19 Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they hand me over to them and they abuse me.”
20 But Jeremiah said, “They will not hand you over. Obey now the voice of the LORD in what I am saying to you, that it may go well with you and your life may be spared.
21 But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that the LORD has shown me:
22 ‘All the women who are left in the house of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon, and they will say, “Your trusted friends have misled you and have prevailed against you; your feet have sunk in the mud, and they turned away.”
23 They will bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand, but will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and you will cause this city to be burned with fire.’”


24 Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know of these words, and you will not die.
25 But if the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, ‘Tell us now what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death,’
26 then you shall say to them, ‘I was presenting my petition before the king, that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.’”
27 Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded; so they stopped speaking with him, for the matter had not been overheard.
28 And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.




Chapter 39


1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
2 In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city wall was breached.
3 Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsekim the chief official, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.
4 When Zedekiah, king of Judah, and all the soldiers saw them, they fled and went out from the city by night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.
5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
6 Then the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes at Riblah; the king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah.
7 He then put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with bronze chains to bring him to Babylon.


8 The Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the house of the people with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
9 As for the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to him, and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried them into exile to Babylon.
10 But some of the poorest of the people, who had nothing, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields on that day.


11 Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
12 “Take him and look after him, and do him no harm; but whatever he says to you, do for him.”
13 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the chief official, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the leading officers of the king of Babylon
14 sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard and entrusted him to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he remained among the people.


15 Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
16 “Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I am about to bring my words upon this city for disaster and not for good, and they will come true before you on that day.
17 But I will deliver you on that day,’ declares the LORD, ‘and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.
18 For I will surely rescue you, and you will not fall by the sword, but you will have your life as spoil, because you have trusted in me,’ declares the LORD.”




Chapter 40


1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had released him from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains among all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
2 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The LORD your God decreed this disaster upon this place,
3 and the LORD has brought it about and done as he said, because you sinned against the LORD and did not listen to his voice. Therefore this thing has happened to you.
4 But now, look, I am freeing you today from the chains that are on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well; but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, stay here. See, all the land is before you; go wherever it seems good and right for you to go.”
5 While he had not yet turned back, he said, “Return then to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people, or go wherever it seems right for you to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him provisions and a gift and let him go.
6 Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.


7 When all the commanders of the forces who were in the field, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land, and had put him in charge of men, women, and children, and some of the poorest of the land who had not been exiled to Babylon,
8 they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—namely Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
9 Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.
10 As for me, I will stay in Mizpah to represent you before the Chaldeans who come to us; but you, gather wine, summer fruit, and oil, and store them in your vessels, and live in your cities that you have taken.”


11 Likewise, when all the Jews who were in Moab and among the sons of Ammon and in Edom and in all the lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan,
12 then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been scattered, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruit in great abundance.


13 Now Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
14 and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis, king of the sons of Ammon, has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.
15 Then Johanan, son of Kareah, spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, “Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know. Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews who have gathered to you would be scattered and the remnant of Judah perish?”
16 But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Do not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely about Ishmael.”




Chapter 41


1 In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family and one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating bread together there at Mizpah,
2 Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
3 Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, that is, with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were found there.


4 Now it came about the next day, after Gedaliah had been killed, before anyone knew of it,
5 that eighty men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the house of the LORD.
6 Then Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.”
7 Yet when they came into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.
8 But ten men were found among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to death, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the field.” So he refrained and did not kill them among their brothers.
9 Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the dead bodies of the men whom he had struck down because of Gedaliah was the one that King Asa had made on account of Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
10 Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah—the king’s daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah son of Ahikam—and Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the sons of Ammon.


11 But when Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done,
12 they took all their men and went to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and they found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon.
13 Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces who were with him, they were glad.
14 So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back and went to Johanan, son of Kareah.
15 But Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the sons of Ammon.


16 Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam; mighty men of war, women, children, and eunuchs whom he had brought back from Gibeon;
17 and they went and stayed at Geruth Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt
18 because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, since Ishmael son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.




Chapter 42


1 Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan son of Kareah, and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest approached
2 and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Let our plea for mercy come before you, and pray to the LORD your God for us, for all this remnant, because we are left but a few out of many, as your eyes now see us,
3 that the LORD your God may tell us the way we should go and the things that we should do.”
4 Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. I will pray to the LORD your God according to your words, and whatever the LORD answers you I will declare to you; I will keep nothing back from you.”
5 Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act according to every word with which the LORD your God sends you to us.
6 Whether it is good or evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, that it may go well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.”


7 At the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
8 Then he called Johanan son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest,
9 and said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your plea before Him:
10 ‘If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not pluck you up, for I relent of the disaster that I have brought upon you.
11 Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Do not fear him,’ declares the LORD, ‘for I am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand.
12 And I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and let you remain in your own land.’


13 But if you say, ‘We will not remain in this land,’ disobeying the voice of the LORD your God,
14 saying, ‘No, we will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the sound of the trumpet or be hungry for bread, and there we will dwell,’
15 then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘If you indeed set your faces to enter Egypt and go to sojourn there,
16 then the sword that you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt, and there you shall die.
17 All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to sojourn there shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; they shall have no remnant or survivor from the disaster that I will bring upon them.’


18 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘As My anger and My wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so My wrath shall be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You shall become a curse, a horror, a reproach, and a disgrace; you shall see this place no more.’
19 The LORD has said concerning you, O remnant of Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ You should clearly know that I have warned you this day.
20 For you have deceived yourselves when you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to the LORD our God, and whatever the LORD our God says, declare to us and we will do it.’
21 And I have declared it to you this day, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in anything that He sent me to tell you.
22 Now therefore, know for certain that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to sojourn.”




Chapter 43


1 When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all the words of the LORD their God, with which the LORD their God had sent him to them, all these words,
2 Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the proud men said to Jeremiah, “You are speaking a lie! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, ‘You must not go to Egypt to reside there.’
3 But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to hand us over to the Chaldeans, so that they may put us to death or take us into exile to Babylon.”
4 So Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the LORD, to stay in the land of Judah.
5 Instead Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which they had been driven, to reside in the land of Judah;
6 the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah;
7 and they went to the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the LORD. And they came to Tahpanhes.


8 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
9 “Take in your hands large stones and hide them in the mortar of the brick terrace that is at the entrance of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah,
10 and say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I am sending for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne over these stones that I have hidden, and he will spread his canopy over them.
11 He will come and strike the land of Egypt: those destined for death, to death; those destined for captivity, to captivity; and those destined for the sword, to the sword.
12 And I will kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and carry them away. He will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself with his garment, and he will depart from there in peace.
13 He will also shatter the pillars of Beth-shemesh that are in the land of Egypt, and he will burn the temples of the gods of Egypt with fire.’”




Chapter 44


1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in the land of Egypt, those living in Migdol, in Tahpanhes, in Noph, and in the land of Pathros, saying,
2 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the disaster that I brought on Jerusalem and on all the cities of Judah, and they are this day a ruin, and no one lives in them,
3 because of their evil which they committed to provoke me to anger, by going to burn incense and to serve other gods that they had not known, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.
4 Yet I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, ‘Do not do this abominable thing that I hate.’
5 But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn from their evil, to stop burning incense to other gods.
6 So my wrath and my anger were poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they have become a ruin and a desolation, as they are this day.


7 “Now thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why are you committing this great evil against yourselves, cutting off man and woman, child and infant, from the midst of Judah, leaving yourselves no remnant,
8 provoking me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have come to reside, that you might be cut off and become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
9 Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
10 To this day they have not humbled themselves, nor have they feared, nor walked in my law or in my statutes that I set before you and before your fathers.


11 “Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I am setting my face against you for disaster and for cutting off all Judah.
12 And I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to reside there, and they will all be consumed. In the land of Egypt they will fall; they will be consumed by the sword and by famine. From the least to the greatest they will die by the sword and by famine, and they will become a curse, a horror, a reproach, and a disgrace.
13 For I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt just as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence.
14 So none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to reside there will escape or survive, to return to the land of Judah to which they long to return to dwell there; for none will return except a few fugitives.”


15 Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a large assembly, and all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
16 “As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you.
17 Instead, we will certainly do everything we have vowed: we will burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, just as we, our fathers, our kings, and our officials did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food, we were well, and saw no disaster.
18 But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.”


19 And the women said, “When we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make cakes in her image and pour out drink offerings to her without our husbands’ approval?”


20 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and to the women, to all the people who had given him that answer,
21 “The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; you and your fathers, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land; did not the LORD remember it, and did it not come into his mind?
22 So the LORD could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your deeds and because of the abominations which you committed; therefore your land has become a ruin, a desolation, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
23 Because you have burned incense and sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD or walked in his law, his statutes, or his testimonies, therefore this disaster has happened to you, as it is this day.”


24 Then Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
25 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands, saying, ‘We will certainly perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.’ Go ahead, then, confirm your vows and perform your vows!
26 Nevertheless hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: ‘I have sworn by my great name,’ says the LORD, ‘that my name will no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord GOD lives.”
27 Watch, for I am watching over them for disaster and not for good, and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by famine until there is an end of them.
28 Yet a few who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose word will stand: mine or theirs.’


29 “And this will be the sign to you,” declares the LORD, “that I am about to punish you in this place, so that you may know that my words will surely stand against you for disaster.”
30 Thus says the LORD: “I am going to give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy who sought his life.”




Chapter 45


1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at Jeremiah’s dictation, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
2 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
3 You said, ‘Woe is me now! For the LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.’
4 You shall say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: What I have built I am about to tear down, and what I have planted I am about to uproot; that is, the whole land.
5 And do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for I am about to bring disaster on all flesh,’ declares the LORD, ‘but I will give you your life as spoil wherever you go.’”




Chapter 46


1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.


2 Concerning Egypt: about the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah.
3 “Prepare shield and buckler, and advance to battle!
4 Harness the horses, mount the steeds, take your positions with helmets on! Polish the spears, put on armor!
5 Why have I seen it? They are terrified, they are retreating, and their mighty men are beaten down. They flee in haste and do not look back—terror on every side!—declares the LORD.
6 Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates they have stumbled and fallen.


7 Who is this rising like the Nile, like rivers whose waters surge?
8 Egypt rises like the Nile, and like rivers whose waters surge, and he says, ‘I will rise, I will cover the earth, I will destroy cities and their inhabitants.’
9 Advance, horses, and drive wildly, chariots! Let the mighty men come out: Cush and Put, who handle the shield, and the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow.


10 That day belongs to the Lord, the LORD of hosts, a day of vengeance, to avenge himself on his foes. The sword will devour and be sated, and drink its fill of their blood; for the Lord, the LORD of hosts, holds a sacrifice in the land of the north, by the river Euphrates.
11 Go up to Gilead and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain you multiply remedies; there is no healing for you.
12 The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full of your cry; for warrior has stumbled against warrior, they have both fallen together.”


13 The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to strike the land of Egypt:
14 “Declare in Egypt, proclaim in Migdol, proclaim in Noph and in Tahpanhes; say, ‘Stand firm and prepare yourself, for the sword has devoured all around you.’
15 Why are your mighty ones cast down? They do not stand, because the LORD has thrust them down.
16 He made many stumble, and they fell one against another, and they said, ‘Rise, and let us go back to our own people and to our native land, away from the sword of the oppressor!’
17 They cried there, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has let the appointed time pass by.’


18 “As I live,” declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, “surely one shall come like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea.
19 Pack your baggage for exile, O inhabitant daughter of Egypt, for Noph shall become a desolation, without inhabitant.
20 Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a gadfly from the north is coming against her.
21 Even her mercenaries in her midst are like fattened calves, for they too have turned and fled together; they did not stand, for the day of their calamity has come upon them, the time of their punishment.
22 Her sound is like that of a serpent as they go; for they march with an army and come against her with axes like those who cut wood.
23 They cut down her forest,” declares the LORD, “though it is impenetrable, for they are more numerous than locusts and cannot be counted.
24 The daughter of Egypt is put to shame; she is given into the hand of the people from the north.”


25 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: “I am about to punish Amon of Thebes, Pharaoh, Egypt, her gods, and her kings—Pharaoh and those who trust in him.
26 I will give them into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of his servants; but afterward Egypt shall be inhabited as in days of old,” declares the LORD.


27 “But you, fear not, O my servant Jacob,
and do not be dismayed, O Israel.
For I will save you from afar
and your offspring from the land of their captivity.
Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease,
and none shall make him afraid.


28 Fear not, O Jacob my servant,” declares the LORD,
“for I am with you.
For I will make a full end of all the nations
to which I have driven you,
but of you I will not make a full end.
I will discipline you with justice,
and will by no means leave you unpunished.”




Chapter 47


1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck Gaza.


2 Thus says the LORD:
“Waters are rising out of the north,
and they will become an overflowing torrent;
they will overflow the land and all that fills it,
the city and those who dwell in it.
Then men will cry out,
and every inhabitant of the land will wail.


3 At the sound of the stamping hooves of his strong horses,
at the rumbling of his chariots,
at the noise of his wheels,
fathers will not look back for their children,
because their hands are feeble,
4 because of the day that is coming
to destroy all the Philistines,
to cut off from Tyre and Sidon
every helper that remains.
For the LORD is destroying the Philistines,
the remnant from the coastland of Caphtor.


5 Baldness has come upon Gaza,
Ashkelon has been ruined.
O remnant of their valley,
how long will you gash yourself?


6 O sword of the LORD, how long until you are quiet?
Put yourself into your sheath;
rest and be still.


7 How can it be quiet,
when the LORD has given it a charge
against Ashkelon and against the seashore?
There he has appointed it.”




Chapter 48


1 Concerning Moab.
Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:
“Woe to Nebo, for it is laid waste!
Kiriathaim is put to shame and captured;
the fortress is put to shame and shattered.
2 There is no more praise for Moab;
in Heshbon they have devised evil against her:
‘Come, let us cut her off from being a nation.’
You also, O Madmen, will be brought to silence;
the sword will pursue you.


3 A cry of distress from Horonaim:
‘Desolation and great destruction!’
4 Moab is destroyed;
her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
5 For the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping continually;
for on the descent of Horonaim
the enemies have heard the cry of destruction.


6 Flee, save your lives,
and be like a juniper in the wilderness.
7 For because you have trusted in your works and your treasures,
you also will be captured;
and Chemosh will go into exile,
his priests and his princes together.
8 And the destroyer will come to every city,
and no city will escape;
the valley will perish,
and the plain will be destroyed,
as the LORD has spoken.


9 Give wings to Moab,
for she must fly away;
her cities will become a desolation,
with no one to dwell in them.


10 Cursed is the one who does the work of the LORD negligently,
and cursed is the one who restrains his sword from blood.


11 Moab has been at ease from his youth,
and he has settled on his lees;
he has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
nor has he gone into exile;
therefore his taste has remained in him,
and his scent has not changed.


12 Therefore, see, the days are coming,” declares the LORD,
“when I shall send to him those who tip vessels,
and they will tip him over;
they will empty his vessels
and shatter his jars.
13 Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,
as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel,
their confidence.


14 How can you say, ‘We are mighty warriors
and men valiant for battle’?
15 Moab is destroyed,
and her cities have gone up in smoke,
and her choice young men have gone down to the slaughter,”
declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
16 The calamity of Moab is near to come,
and his disaster hastens swiftly.


17 Grieve for him, all you who are around him,
and all who know his name;
say, ‘How the mighty scepter is broken,
the glorious staff!’


18 Come down from your glory,
and sit in thirst,
O inhabitant of Dibon,
for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you,
he has destroyed your strongholds.
19 Stand by the road and watch,
O inhabitant of Aroer;
ask him who flees and her who escapes,
say, ‘What has happened?’
20 Moab is put to shame, for it is shattered;
wail and cry out;
declare by the Arnon
that Moab is laid waste.


21 “Judgment has come upon the plateau—
upon Holon and Jahzah and Mephaath,
22 upon Dibon and Nebo and Beth-diblathaim,
23 upon Kiriathaim and Beth-gamul and Beth-meon,
24 upon Kerioth and Bozrah,
and upon all the cities of the land of Moab,
far and near.


25 The horn of Moab has been cut off,
and his arm broken,” declares the LORD.


26 “Make him drunk,
for he magnified himself against the LORD;
Moab will wallow in his vomit,
and he also will become a laughingstock.
27 Was not Israel a laughingstock to you?
Was he found among thieves,
that whenever you spoke of him
you wagged your head?


28 Leave the cities and dwell in the rock,
O inhabitants of Moab,
and be like a dove
that makes her nest in the sides of the mouth of a pit.


29 We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud;
his loftiness, his arrogance, his pride,
and the haughtiness of his heart.
30 I know his wrath,” declares the LORD,
“but it is nothing;
his boastings accomplish nothing.


31 Therefore I wail for Moab,
I cry out for all Moab;
for the men of Kir-heres I mourn.
32 More than for Jazer I weep for you,
O vine of Sibmah.
Your branches passed over the sea,
they reached as far as Jazer;
the destroyer has fallen upon your summer fruit
and your vintage.
33 Gladness and joy are taken away
from the fruitful field
and from the land of Moab;
and I have made the wine to cease from the winepresses;
no one will tread them with shouting;
the shouting will be no shouting.


34 From the cry of Heshbon to Elealeh,
as far as Jahaz they have raised their voice;
from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah,
for even the waters of Nimrim will become desolate.
35 And I will bring to an end in Moab,” declares the LORD,
“the one who offers sacrifice on the high place
and the one who burns incense to his gods.


36 Therefore my heart moans for Moab like flutes;
my heart moans like flutes for the men of Kir-heres,
for the wealth that they have gained has perished.


37 For every head is bald and every beard cut off;
on all hands are gashes,
and around the waist sackcloth.
38 On all the housetops of Moab and in its squares
there is wailing everywhere;
for I have broken Moab like a vessel
for which no one cares,” declares the LORD.
39 “How it is shattered!
They wail!
How Moab has turned his back in shame!
So Moab has become a laughingstock
and an object of terror to all around him.”


40 For thus says the LORD:
“Behold, one will swoop like an eagle
and spread his wings against Moab.
41 Kerioth is taken,
and the strongholds are seized;
and the heart of the warriors of Moab on that day
will be like the heart of a woman in her pangs.


42 Moab will be destroyed from being a people,
because he has magnified himself against the LORD.
43 Terror, pit, and snare
are upon you, O inhabitant of Moab,”
declares the LORD.
44 “He who flees from the terror
will fall into the pit,
and he who climbs out of the pit
will be caught in the snare;
for I will bring upon her, upon Moab,
the year of their punishment,” declares the LORD.


45 “In the shadow of Heshbon
the fugitives stand without strength;
for a fire has gone out from Heshbon,
a flame from the midst of Sihon;
it has devoured the forehead of Moab
and the crown of the sons of tumult.
46 Woe to you, O Moab!
The people of Chemosh are undone;
for your sons have been taken captive,
and your daughters into exile.


47 Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab
in the latter days,” declares the LORD.
Thus far is the judgment of Moab.




Chapter 49


1 Concerning the sons of Ammon.
Thus says the LORD:
“Has Israel no sons? Has he no heir?
Why then has Malcam taken possession of Gad,
and his people settled in its cities?
2 Therefore, behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD,
“when I will cause the sound of battle to be heard
against Rabbah of the Ammonites;
it shall become a desolate mound,
and her villages shall be set on fire.
Then Israel shall dispossess those who dispossessed him,”
says the LORD.
3 “Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste!
Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah,
gird yourselves with sackcloth;
lament, and run to and fro among the walls,
for Malcam shall go into exile,
his priests and his princes together.
4 Why do you boast of your valleys,
your flowing valley, O faithless daughter,
who trusted in her treasures, saying,
‘Who will come against me?’
5 See how I will bring terror upon you,”
declares the Lord GOD of hosts,
“from all around you;
and each of you will be driven headlong,
and there shall be no one to gather the fugitives.


6 But afterward I will restore the fortunes of the sons of Ammon,”
declares the LORD.


7 Concerning Edom.
Thus says the LORD of hosts:
“Is there no longer wisdom in Teman?
Has counsel perished from the prudent?
Has their wisdom vanished?
8 Flee, turn back, dwell deep,
O inhabitants of Dedan,
for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him,
the time when I punish him.
9 If grape gatherers came to you,
would they not leave gleanings?
If thieves came by night,
would they not destroy only until they had enough?
10 But I have stripped Esau bare;
I have uncovered his hiding places,
and he is not able to conceal himself.
His children are destroyed, his brothers and his neighbors;
and he is no more.
11 Leave your orphans, I will keep them alive,
and let your widows trust in Me.”


12 For thus says the LORD:
“Look how those who were not sentenced to drink the cup
will surely drink it,
and are you the one who will go unpunished?
You shall not go unpunished,
but you shall surely drink it.
13 For I have sworn by Myself,” declares the LORD,
“that Bozrah shall become a horror,
a reproach, a ruin, and a curse;
and all its cities shall become perpetual ruins.”


14 I have heard a message from the LORD,
and an envoy has been sent among the nations, saying,
“Gather yourselves together and come against her,
and rise up for battle!”
15 “For you will see that I will make you small among the nations,
despised among men.
16 As for the terror of you,
the pride of your heart has deceived you,
O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock,
who hold the height of the hill.
Though you make your nest as high as the eagle,
I will bring you down from there,” declares the LORD.


17 “Edom shall become an object of horror;
everyone who passes by it will be appalled
and will hiss at all its wounds.
18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah
and their neighboring cities,” declares the LORD,
“no man shall live there,
nor shall any son of man sojourn in it.
19 One shall come up like a lion
from the thickets of the Jordan against a perennial pasture,
for suddenly I will make him run away from it.
And I will appoint over it whomever I choose.
For who is like Me, and who will summon Me into court?
Who is the shepherd who can stand before Me?
20 Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD that He has taken against Edom,
and His purposes that He has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman:
Surely the little ones of the flock shall be dragged away;
surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them.
21 The earth has quaked at the sound of their fall;
a cry! Its sound is heard at the Red Sea.
22 Behold, one shall fly swiftly like an eagle
and spread his wings against Bozrah;
and the hearts of the warriors of Edom in that day
shall be like the heart of a woman in her pangs.”


23 Concerning Damascus.
“Hamath and Arpad are put to shame,
for they have heard bad news;
they melt in fear,
there is trouble on the sea,
it cannot be quiet.
24 Damascus has become feeble,
she has turned to flee,
and panic has seized her;
anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her,
like a woman in labor.
25 How the city of praise has not been forsaken,
the city of My joy!
26 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets,
and all the men of war shall be silenced in that day,”
declares the LORD of hosts.
27 “I will set fire to the wall of Damascus,
and it shall consume the strongholds of Ben-hadad.”


28 Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor,
which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck down.
Thus says the LORD:
“Rise up, go up against Kedar,
and destroy the sons of the east.
29 They shall take their tents and their flocks,
their curtains and all their goods;
they shall carry away their camels for themselves,
and they shall cry out to them,
‘Terror on every side!’
30 Flee, wander far away, dwell deep,
O inhabitants of Hazor,” declares the LORD,
“for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has counseled against you,
and has conceived a plan against you.
31 Rise up, go up against a nation at ease,
that dwells securely,” declares the LORD,
“that has neither gates nor bars,
that dwells alone.
32 Their camels shall become plunder,
and the multitude of their herds spoil;
and I will scatter to every wind
those who cut the corners of their hair,
and I will bring their calamity from every side,” declares the LORD.
33 “Hazor shall become a haunt of jackals,
a desolation forever;
no man shall dwell there,
nor shall any son of man sojourn in it.”


34 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam,
at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
35 “Thus says the LORD of hosts:
Look! I will break the bow of Elam,
the chief of their might.
36 And I will bring upon Elam the four winds
from the four quarters of heaven,
and I will scatter them to all those winds;
and there shall be no nation
to which the outcasts of Elam shall not go.
37 And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies
and before those who seek their life;
and I will bring disaster upon them,
My fierce anger,” declares the LORD,
“and I will send the sword after them
until I have consumed them.
38 Then I will set My throne in Elam
and destroy from there king and princes,” declares the LORD.
39 “But it shall come to pass in the latter days
that I will restore the fortunes of Elam,” declares the LORD.




Chapter 50


1 The word that the LORD spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.
2 Proclaim among the nations and make it heard; raise a signal, proclaim and do not hide it. Say, Babylon has been captured, Bel is shamed, Merodach is dismayed; her idols are disgraced, her images are shattered.
3 For a nation has come up against her out of the north; it will make her land a desolation, and no one shall dwell in it—neither man nor beast—they have fled and gone.


4 In those days and at that time, declares the LORD, the sons of Israel will come, they and the sons of Judah together; they will go weeping as they go, and will seek the LORD their God.
5 They will ask the way to Zion, their faces turned toward it, saying, “Come, let us join ourselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten.”
6 My people were lost sheep; their shepherds led them astray, turning them away on the mountains; they went from mountain to hill, they forgot their resting place.
7 All who found them devoured them, and their enemies said, “We are not guilty, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of righteousness, the LORD, the hope of their fathers.”
8 Flee from the midst of Babylon, and go out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be like the he-goats before the flock.
9 For I am stirring up and bringing against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country, and they will array themselves against her; from there she shall be taken. Their arrows are like those of a skilled warrior who does not return empty-handed.
10 Chaldea shall become plunder; all who plunder her shall be satisfied, declares the LORD.


11 Because you rejoiced, because you exulted, you who plunder My inheritance, because you frisk like a heifer threshing grain and neigh like strong horses,
12 your mother shall be utterly shamed, she who bore you shall be disgraced. See, she shall be the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
13 Because of the wrath of the LORD she shall not be inhabited, but shall be an utter desolation; everyone who passes by Babylon shall be appalled and hiss because of all her wounds.
14 Draw up your battle lines against Babylon all around, all you who bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the LORD.
15 Raise a shout against her all around; she has surrendered, her bulwarks have fallen, her walls are thrown down. For this is the vengeance of the LORD; take vengeance on her, as she has done, do to her.


16 Cut off the sower from Babylon and him who handles the sickle at harvest time; because of the oppressing sword every man shall turn to his own people and every man flee to his own land.
17 Israel is a hunted sheep driven away by lions; first the king of Assyria devoured him, and last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gnawed his bones.
18 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria.
19 I will bring Israel back to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
20 In those days and at that time, declares the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found, for I will pardon those whom I leave as a remnant.


21 Go up against the land of Merathaim, and against the inhabitants of Pekod; waste and utterly destroy after them, declares the LORD, and do all that I have commanded you.
22 The noise of battle is in the land, and great destruction.
23 How the hammer of the whole earth is cut down and broken! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!
24 I set a snare for you and you were caught, O Babylon, and you did not know it; you were found and also seized, because you strove against the LORD.
25 The LORD has opened His armory and brought out the weapons of His wrath, for the Lord GOD of hosts has work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.
26 Come against her from every side; open her storehouses; pile her up like heaps and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her remain.
27 Slay all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them, for their day has come, the time of their punishment.
28 The voice of those who flee and escape from the land of Babylon comes to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of His temple.
29 Summon archers against Babylon, all who bend the bow; encamp around her; let no one escape. Repay her according to her deeds; do to her according to all that she has done, for she has been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.


30 Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares, and all her warriors shall perish in that day, declares the LORD.
31 I am against you, O proud one, declares the Lord GOD of hosts, for your day has come, the time when I will punish you.
32 The proud one shall stumble and fall, with no one to raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that is around him.


33 Thus says the LORD of hosts: the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah are oppressed together, and all who took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.
34 Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is His name. He will surely plead their cause, that He may give rest to the earth, but unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.
35 A sword is against the Chaldeans, declares the LORD, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, and against her princes and against her wise men.
36 A sword is against the diviners, and they shall become fools; a sword is against her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.
37 A sword is against their horses and against their chariots and against all the mixed people who are in her midst, and they shall become like women; a sword is against her treasures, and they shall be plundered.
38 A drought is against her waters, and they shall dry up, for it is a land of idols, and they go mad over their images.
39 Therefore wild beasts shall dwell with hyenas, and ostriches shall dwell in her; she shall never again be inhabited or lived in for all generations.
40 As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, declares the LORD, so no man shall dwell there, and no son of man shall sojourn in her.


41 A people comes from the north, a great nation and many kings are stirred up from the ends of the earth.
42 They hold bow and spear; they are cruel and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride upon horses, arrayed as a man for battle against you, O daughter of Babylon.
43 The king of Babylon heard the report of them, and his hands grew feeble; anguish seized him, pain like that of a woman in labor.
44 See, like a lion coming up from the thickets of the Jordan to a secure pasture, I will suddenly make them run from it, and whoever is chosen I will appoint over it. For who is like Me? Who will summon Me to court? Who is the shepherd who can stand before Me?
45 Therefore hear the plan of the LORD that He has made against Babylon, and His purposes that He has formed against the land of the Chaldeans: surely the little ones of the flock shall drag them away; surely He shall make their pasture desolate because of them.
46 At the sound of Babylon’s capture the earth shall tremble, and her cry shall be heard among the nations.




Chapter 51


1 Thus says the LORD: See, I am stirring up against Babylon and against those who dwell in Leb-kamai a destroying wind.
2 I will send strangers to Babylon, and they shall winnow her, and they shall empty her land; for in the day of trouble they shall be against her all around.
3 Let not the archer bend his bow, and let him not stand up in his armor; do not spare her young men, utterly destroy all her host.
4 They shall fall slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in her streets.


5 For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God, the LORD of hosts, though their land was full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.
6 Flee from the midst of Babylon, and let each save his life; do not be cut off in her punishment, for this is the time of the LORD’s vengeance; He is repaying her what she has done.
7 Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD’s hand, making all the earth drunk; the nations drank of her wine, therefore the nations have gone mad.
8 Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been shattered; wail for her! Take balm for her pain; perhaps she may be healed.
9 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed. Leave her, and let each go to his own land, for her judgment reaches to heaven and is lifted up to the skies.
10 The LORD has brought forth our vindication; come, let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.


11 Sharpen the arrows, take up the shields! The LORD has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes, because His purpose concerning Babylon is to destroy it, for that is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance for His temple.
12 Raise a standard against the walls of Babylon, strengthen the watch, set the guards, prepare the ambushes, for the LORD has both planned and done what He spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
13 O you who dwell by many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your covetousness.
14 The LORD of hosts has sworn by Himself: Surely I will fill you with men like locusts, and they shall raise a shout of triumph over you.


15 It is He who made the earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom, and by His understanding stretched out the heavens.
16 When He utters His voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain, and brings forth the wind from His storehouses.
17 Every man is stupid, without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols, for his images are a lie, and there is no breath in them.
18 They are worthless, a work of delusion; at the time of their punishment they shall perish.
19 The portion of Jacob is not like these, for He is the one who formed all things, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; the LORD of hosts is His name.


20 You are My hammer and weapon of war; with you I shatter nations, with you I destroy kingdoms;
21 with you I shatter horse and rider, with you I shatter chariot and charioteer;
22 with you I shatter man and woman, with you I shatter old and young, with you I shatter young man and maiden;
23 with you I shatter shepherd and flock, with you I shatter farmer and yoke of oxen, with you I shatter governors and commanders.
24 I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all the evil they have done in Zion before your eyes, declares the LORD.


25 I am against you, O destroying mountain, declares the LORD, which destroys all the earth; I will stretch out My hand against you, and roll you down from the crags, and make you a burned-out mountain.
26 They shall not take from you a stone for a corner or a stone for a foundation, but you shall be a perpetual waste, declares the LORD.
27 Raise a signal in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations; consecrate the nations against her, summon the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; appoint a marshal against her; bring up horses like bristling locusts.
28 Consecrate the nations against her, the kings of Media, their governors and all their deputies, and every land under their dominion.
29 The earth trembles and writhes, for the LORD’s purposes against Babylon stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant.


30 The warriors of Babylon have ceased fighting; they remain in their strongholds; their strength has failed; they have become like women. Her dwellings are set on fire; her bars are broken.
31 One runner runs to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken from end to end,
32 the fords have been seized, the marshes have been burned with fire, and the men of war are terrified.


33 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled; yet a little while and the time of her harvest will come.
34 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me like a dragon, he has filled his belly with my delicacies, he has rinsed me out.
35 May the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, say the inhabitant of Zion; and, “My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,” says Jerusalem.
36 Therefore thus says the LORD: See, I will plead your cause and take vengeance for you; I will dry up her sea and make her fountain dry,
37 and Babylon shall become a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals, an object of horror and of hissing, without inhabitant.
38 They shall roar together like lions; they shall growl like lions’ cubs.
39 While they are inflamed I will prepare their drink and make them drunk, that they may become merry and sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake, declares the LORD.
40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and male goats.


41 How Sheshach has been taken, and the praise of the whole earth seized! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!
42 The sea has come up over Babylon; she is covered with its roaring waves.
43 Her cities have become a horror, a dry land and a desert, a land in which no man dwells, and through which no son of man passes.
44 I will punish Bel in Babylon and make him disgorge what he has swallowed. The nations shall no longer stream to him; the wall of Babylon has fallen.


45 Go out of her midst, My people, and let every man save his life from the fierce anger of the LORD.
46 Let not your heart faint, and do not fear the rumor that is heard in the land; for in one year one rumor will come, and afterward another in another year, and violence will be in the land, with ruler against ruler.


47 Therefore, see, the days are coming when I will punish the idols of Babylon; her whole land shall be put to shame, and all her slain shall fall in her midst.
48 Then the heavens and the earth and all that is in them shall sing for joy over Babylon, for the destroyers shall come to her from the north, declares the LORD.
49 Babylon must fall for the slain of Israel, as for Babylon have fallen the slain of all the earth.


50 You who have escaped from the sword, go, do not stand still! Remember the LORD from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your heart.
51 We are ashamed, for we have heard reproach; disgrace has covered our faces, for foreigners have come into the holy places of the LORD’s house.
52 Therefore, see, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will punish her idols, and throughout her land the wounded shall groan.
53 Though Babylon should ascend to heaven, and though she should fortify her strong height, yet destroyers from Me shall come to her, declares the LORD.


54 A sound of cry from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
55 For the LORD is laying Babylon waste and stilling her mighty voice; their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is raised.
56 For a destroyer has come upon her, upon Babylon; her warriors are taken, their bows are broken, for the LORD is a God of recompense; He will surely repay.
57 I will make her princes and her wise men, her governors, her commanders, and her warriors drunk; they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake, declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.


58 Thus says the LORD of hosts: The broad wall of Babylon shall be leveled to the ground, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; the peoples labor for nothing, and the nations weary themselves only for fire.


59 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was quartermaster.
60 Jeremiah wrote in a book all the disaster that should come upon Babylon, all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you come to Babylon, see that you read all these words,
62 and say, ‘O LORD, You have spoken concerning this place, that You will cut it off, so that none shall dwell in it, neither man nor beast, but it shall be desolate forever.’
63 When you finish reading this book, tie a stone to it and cast it into the middle of the Euphrates,
64 and say, ‘Thus shall Babylon sink, to rise no more, because of the disaster that I am bringing upon her, and they shall weary themselves.’”


Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.




Chapter 52


1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.
3 For because of the anger of the LORD it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that He cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.


4 In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and they encamped against it and built siegeworks all around it.
5 So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
6 In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine became so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
7 Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, by the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city; and they went in the direction of the Arabah.
8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.
9 Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
10 The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the princes of Judah at Riblah.
11 He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon and put him in prison till the day of his death.


12 In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
13 He burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned with fire.
14 And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
15 And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people, and the rest of the people who were left in the city, and the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen.
16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.


17 And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands, and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all the bronze to Babylon.
18 They also took away the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service.
19 The captain of the guard took away the basins and the firepans and the bowls and the pots and the lampstands and the spoons and the cups—whatever was of gold in gold, and whatever was of silver in silver.
20 As for the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze oxen that were under the sea, and the stands, which King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these things was beyond weighing.
21 As for the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, its circumference twelve cubits; it was four fingers thick, and hollow.
22 On it was a capital of bronze, and the height of one capital was five cubits; a network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were around the capital; and the second pillar was like these, with pomegranates.
23 There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates around the network were a hundred.


24 The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold;
25 and from the city he took an officer who was over the men of war, and seven men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city, and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city.
26 And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
27 And the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah went into exile from its land.


28 This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Jews;
29 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred thirty-two persons from Jerusalem;
30 in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away seven hundred forty-five persons of the Jews; all the persons were four thousand six hundred.


31 And in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year he began to reign, showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison.
32 He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
33 So Jehoiachin changed his prison garments, and he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life.
34 And as for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king of Babylon, day by day, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.﻿The Lamentations of Ezekiel


Chapter 1


1 How lonely sits the city that was full of people!
She has become like a widow, she who was great among the nations!
She who was a princess among the provinces has become a slave.


2 She weeps bitterly in the night,
and her tears are on her cheeks;
among all her lovers there is none to comfort her.
All her friends have dealt treacherously with her;
they have become her enemies.


3 Judah has gone into exile under affliction
and under harsh servitude;
she dwells among the nations,
but finds no rest.
All her pursuers have overtaken her
in the midst of distress.


4 The roads of Zion mourn,
because none come to the appointed feasts;
all her gates are desolate,
her priests groan,
her virgins grieve,
and she herself is bitter.


5 Her adversaries have become her masters,
her enemies prosper,
for the LORD has afflicted her
for the multitude of her transgressions;
her little ones have gone away captive
before the foe.


6 From the daughter of Zion
all her splendor has departed.
Her princes have become like deer
that find no pasture;
they fled without strength
before the pursuer.


7 In the days of her affliction and wandering,
Jerusalem remembers all her precious things
that were from the days of old.
When her people fell into the hand of the enemy
and no one helped her,
the adversaries saw her and mocked
at her downfall.


8 Jerusalem has grievously sinned;
therefore she has become unclean.
All who honored her despise her,
because they have seen her nakedness;
she herself groans
and turns away.


9 Her uncleanness was in her skirts;
she did not consider her latter end.
Therefore she has fallen astonishingly;
she has no comforter.
“See, O LORD, my affliction,
for the enemy has magnified himself.”


10 The adversary has stretched out his hand
over all her precious things;
for she has seen the nations
enter her sanctuary,
those whom You commanded
that they should not enter Your assembly.


11 All her people groan
as they search for bread;
they have given their precious things for food
to restore their lives.
“See, O LORD, and look,
for I am despised.”


12 “Is it nothing to you, all who pass by?
Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow,
which has been brought upon me,
which the LORD inflicted
in the day of His fierce anger.


13 From on high He sent fire into my bones,
and it prevailed against them;
He has spread a net for my feet,
He has turned me back;
He has made me desolate
and faint all the day long.


14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand;
they are knit together;
they have come up upon my neck;
He has made my strength fail.
The Lord has given me into the hands
of those whom I cannot withstand.


15 The Lord has rejected
all my mighty men in my midst;
He has called an assembly against me
to crush my young men.
The Lord has trodden as in a winepress
the virgin daughter of Judah.


16 For these things I weep;
my eyes flow with tears,
for a comforter is far from me,
one to restore my life.
My children are desolate,
for the enemy has prevailed.”


17 Zion stretches out her hands,
but there is no one to comfort her;
the LORD has commanded against Jacob
that his neighbors should be his adversaries;
Jerusalem has become
an unclean thing among them.


18 “The LORD is righteous,
for I have rebelled against His commandment.
Hear, all peoples, and see my sorrow;
my virgins and my young men
have gone into captivity.


19 I called to my lovers,
but they deceived me;
my priests and my elders perished in the city
while they sought food for themselves
to restore their lives.


20 See, O LORD, for I am in distress;
my spirit is greatly troubled;
my heart is overturned within me,
for I have been very rebellious.
In the street the sword bereaves;
in the house it is like death.


21 They have heard that I sigh;
there is none to comfort me.
All my enemies have heard of my trouble;
they are glad that You have done it.
Bring the day that You have proclaimed,
that they may become like me.


22 Let all their wickedness come before You,
and deal with them as You have dealt with me
because of all my transgressions;
for my sighs are many,
and my heart is faint.”




Chapter 2


1 How the Lord in His anger
has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud!
He has cast down from heaven to earth
the splendor of Israel,
and has not remembered His footstool
in the day of His anger.


2 The Lord has swallowed up without mercy
all the habitations of Jacob;
He has torn down in His wrath the strongholds
of the daughter of Judah;
He has brought them down to the ground;
He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.


3 In fierce anger He has cut off
every horn of Israel;
He has withdrawn His right hand
from before the enemy;
He has burned against Jacob like a flaming fire
consuming all around.


4 He has bent His bow like an enemy;
He has set His right hand like an adversary
and slain all that were pleasant to the eye;
in the tent of the daughter of Zion
He has poured out His fury like fire.


5 The Lord has become like an enemy;
He has swallowed up Israel;
He has swallowed up all her palaces;
He has destroyed her strongholds,
and multiplied in the daughter of Judah
mourning and lamentation.


6 He has violently treated His tabernacle like a garden hut;
He has destroyed His appointed meeting place.
The LORD has caused the appointed feast and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion,
and in the indignation of His anger has despised king and priest.


7 The Lord has rejected His altar;
He has abandoned His sanctuary;
He has delivered into the hand of the enemy
the walls of her palaces.
They have raised a cry in the house of the LORD
as on the day of an appointed feast.


8 The LORD determined to destroy
the wall of the daughter of Zion;
He stretched out the measuring line;
He did not withdraw His hand from destroying;
He made rampart and wall lament;
they languish together.


9 Her gates have sunk into the ground;
He has destroyed and broken her bars;
her king and her princes are among the nations;
the law is no more,
and her prophets find no vision from the LORD.


10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground and keep silence;
they have thrown dust on their heads;
they have girded themselves with sackcloth;
the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.


11 My eyes fail because of tears,
my spirit is troubled;
my heart is poured out on the ground
because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,
when the little ones and infants faint
in the streets of the city.


12 They say to their mothers,
“Where is grain and wine?”
as they faint like wounded men
in the streets of the city,
as their life is poured out
on their mothers’ bosom.


13 What can I say for you?
What can I compare to you, O daughter of Jerusalem?
What can I liken to you that I may comfort you,
O virgin daughter of Zion?
For your ruin is vast as the sea;
who can heal you?


14 Your prophets have seen for you
vain and foolish things;
they have not exposed your iniquity
to restore your fortunes,
but have seen for you oracles
of falsehood and delusion.


15 All who pass along the way clap their hands at you;
they hiss and shake their heads
at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,
“Is this the city that was called
the perfection of beauty,
the joy of the whole earth?”


16 All your enemies open their mouths wide against you;
they hiss and gnash their teeth;
they say,
“We have swallowed her up!
Surely this is the day we have waited for;
we have found it, we have seen it.”


17 The LORD has done what He purposed;
He has carried out His word
which He commanded from days of old;
He has thrown down without pity
and has caused the enemy to rejoice over you;
He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.


18 Their heart cried out to the Lord,
“O wall of the daughter of Zion,
let tears run down like a river day and night;
give yourself no relief;
let not the apple of your eye cease.”


19 “Arise, cry out in the night
at the beginning of the watches;
pour out your heart like water
before the face of the Lord;
lift up your hands toward Him
for the life of your little ones,
who faint for hunger
at the head of every street.”


20 “Look, O LORD, and consider
to whom You have done this!
Should women eat the fruit of their womb,
the children they have cared for?
Should priest and prophet be slain
in the sanctuary of the Lord?”


21 The young and the old
lie on the ground in the streets;
my virgins and my young men
have fallen by the sword;
You have slain them in the day of Your anger;
You have slaughtered without pity.


22 You have summoned as on an appointed day
my terrors on every side,
and there was no one who escaped or survived
in the day of the LORD’s anger;
those whom I have cared for and raised,
my enemy has destroyed.




Chapter 3

1 I am the man who has seen affliction
by the rod of His wrath.
2 He has driven me and brought me
into darkness and not light.
3 Surely against me He turns His hand
again and again all the day.


4 He has worn away my flesh and my skin;
He has broken my bones.
5 He has besieged me and surrounded me
with bitterness and hardship.
6 He has made me dwell in dark places
like those long dead.


7 He has walled me in so I cannot escape;
He has made my chains heavy.
8 Even when I cry out and call for help,
He shuts out my prayer.
9 He has blocked my ways with hewn stone;
He has made my paths crooked.


10 He is to me like a bear lying in wait,
like a lion in hiding.
11 He has turned aside my ways and torn me in pieces;
He has made me desolate.
12 He has bent His bow and set me
as the target for His arrow.


13 He has caused the arrows of His quiver
to pierce my inward parts.
14 I have become the laughingstock of all my people,
their song all the day.
15 He has filled me with bitterness,
He has made me drunk with wormwood.


16 He has broken my teeth with gravel;
He has covered me with ashes.
17 My soul has been removed from peace;
I have forgotten what prosperity is.
18 So I said, “My strength is gone,
and my hope from the LORD.”


19 Remember my affliction and my wandering,
the wormwood and the gall.
20 My soul continually remembers
and is bowed down within me.
21 Yet this I call to mind,
and therefore I have hope:


22 The LORD’s loyal love never ceases;
His compassions never fail.
23 They are new every morning;
great is Your faithfulness.
24 “The LORD is my portion,” says my soul,
“therefore I will hope in Him.”


25 The LORD is good to those who wait for Him,
to the soul who seeks Him.
26 It is good that one should wait quietly
for the salvation of the LORD.
27 It is good for a man
to bear the yoke in his youth.


28 Let him sit alone and be silent,
because He has laid it on him.
29 Let him put his mouth in the dust—
perhaps there is hope.
30 Let him give his cheek to the one who strikes him;
let him be filled with reproach.


31 For the Lord will not
reject forever.
32 Though He causes grief, He will have compassion
according to the abundance of His steadfast love.
33 For He does not willingly afflict
or grieve the sons of man.


34 To crush underfoot
all the prisoners of the earth,
35 to deny a man justice
in the presence of the Most High,
36 to subvert a man in his cause—
the Lord does not approve.


37 Who is there who speaks and it happens,
unless the Lord has commanded it?
38 Is it not from the mouth of the Most High
that both calamities and blessings come?
39 Why should any living man comlain,
a man for the punishment of his sins?


40 Let us test and examine our ways,
and return to the LORD.
41 Let us lift up our hearts and hands
to God in heaven:
42 “We have transgressed and rebelled,
and You have not pardoned.


43 You have wrapped Yourself in anger and pursued us;
You have slain without pity.
44 You have covered Yourself with a cloud
so that no prayer can pass through.
45 You have made us scum and refuse
among the nations.


46 All our enemies have opened their mouths
against us.
47 Terror and pitfall have come upon us,
devastation and destruction.
48 My eyes flow with streams of tears
for the destruction of the daughter of my people.


49 My eyes flow unceasingly,
without relief,
50 until the LORD looks down
and sees from heaven.
51 My eyes bring pain to my soul
because of all the daughters of my city.”


52 My enemies without cause
hunted me down like a bird.
53 They silenced my life in the pit
and cast stones on me.
54 Waters flowed over my head;
I said, “I am cut off.”


55 I called on Your name, O LORD,
from the lowest pit.
56 You heard my voice:
“Do not close Your ear to my cry for relief,
to my cry for help.”
57 You drew near when I called on You;
You said, “Do not fear.”


58 You have pleaded the causes of my soul, O Lord;
You have redeemed my life.
59 You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me;
judge my cause.
60 You have seen all their vengeance,
all their plots against me.


61 You have heard their reproach, O LORD,
all their schemes against me,
62 the lips of my enemies and their whispering
are against me all day long.
63 Look at their sitting down and their rising up;
I am their song.


64 You will repay them, O LORD,
according to the work of their hands.
65 You will give them hardness of heart;
Your curse will be on them.
66 You will pursue them in anger and destroy them
from under the heavens of the LORD.



Chapter 4


1 How the gold has grown dim,
the fine gold changed!
The sacred stones lie scattered
at every street corner.


2 The precious sons of Zion,
worth their weight in pure gold—
how they are reckoned as clay jars,
the work of a potter’s hands!


3 Even jackals offer the breast
to nurse their young,
but the daughter of my people has become cruel,
like ostriches in the wilderness.


4 The tongue of the nursing infant
sticks to its palate for thirst;
the children beg for bread,
but no one breaks it for them.


5 Those who once feasted on delicacies
lie dying in the streets;
those who were brought up in scarlet
now embrace ash heaps.


6 The guilt of the daughter of my people
is greater than the sin of Sodom,
which was overthrown in a moment,
and no hands were laid on her.


7 Her princes were purer than snow,
whiter than milk;
their bodies were more ruddy than coral,
their form like sapphire.


8 Now their appearance is darker than soot;
they are not recognized in the streets.
Their skin has shriveled on their bones;
it has become dry as wood.


9 Those slain by the sword
were better off than those slain by hunger,
who waste away,
pierced through for lack of the fruits of the field.


10 The hands of compassionate women
have boiled their own children;
they became their food
in the destruction of the daughter of my people.


11 The LORD has spent His fury;
He has poured out His fierce anger.
He kindled a fire in Zion,
and it consumed her foundations.


12 The kings of the earth did not believe,
nor any of the inhabitants of the world,
that foe or enemy could enter
the gates of Jerusalem.


13 It was because of the sins of her prophets
and the iniquities of her priests,
who shed in her midst
the blood of the righteous.


14 They wandered, blind, through the streets,
defiled with blood,
so that none could touch
their garments.


15 “Away! Unclean!” they cried to them.
“Away! Away! Do not touch!”
So they fled and wandered;
it was said among the nations,
“They shall dwell here no longer.”


16 The LORD Himself has scattered them;
He no longer regards them.
They did not honor the priests;
they showed no favor to the elders.


17 Still our eyes failed,
watching vainly for help.
We watched and watched
for a nation that could not save.


18 They hunted our steps
so that we could not walk in our streets.
Our end drew near; our days were finished,
for our end had come.


19 Our pursuers were swifter
than the eagles of the sky.
They chased us on the mountains;
they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.


20 The breath of our nostrils,
the LORD’s anointed,
was captured in their pits—
he of whom we said,
“Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.”


21 Rejoice and be glad,
O daughter of Edom,
you who dwell in the land of Uz!
But to you also the cup shall pass;
you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.


22 The punishment of your iniquity,
O daughter of Zion, is accomplished;
He will no longer exile you.
But He will punish your iniquity,
O daughter of Edom;
He will expose your sins.




Chapter 5


1 Remember, O LORD, what has come upon us;
look and see our disgrace.
2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
our houses to foreigners.
3 We have become orphans, fatherless;
our mothers are like widows.
4 We must pay for the water we drink;
our wood comes at a price.
5 We are pursued with a yoke on our necks;
we are weary, we find no rest.
6 We have given our hand to Egypt
and to Assyria, to get enough bread.
7 Our fathers sinned and are no more,
but we bear their iniquities.
8 Servants rule over us;
there is none to deliver us from their hand.
9 We get our bread at the peril of our lives
because of the sword in the wilderness.
10 Our skin burns like an oven,
from the scorching heat of famine.
11 They ravished the women in Zion,
the virgins in the towns of Judah.
12 Princes were hung up by their hands;
no respect was shown to the elders.
13 Young men were made to grind at the mill,
and boys staggered under loads of wood.
14 The elders have left the gate,
the young men their music.
15 The joy of our hearts has ceased;
our dance has turned into mourning.
16 The crown has fallen from our head;
woe to us, for we have sinned!
17 Because of this our heart is faint;
because of these things our eyes grow dim,
18 because Mount Zion lies desolate;
foxes prowl over it.
19 You, O LORD, reign forever;
Your throne endures from generation to generation.
20 Why do You forget us forever,
why do You forsake us so long?
21 Restore us to Yourself, O LORD, that we may return;
renew our days as of old—
22 unless You have utterly rejected us,
and are exceedingly angry with us.﻿Ezekiel


Chapter 1


1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, while I was among the exiles by the River Chebar, that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.


2 On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin—
3 the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the River Chebar. And the hand of the LORD was upon him there.


4 And I looked, and saw a storm wind came out of the north, a great cloud with fire flashing back and forth, and a brilliance all around it, and in the midst of the fire something like glowing metal.
5 And from its midst came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.
6 Each one had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.
7 Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like polished bronze.
8 Under their wings on their four sides were human hands. And the four of them had their faces and their wings.
9 Their wings touched one another. They did not turn as they moved; each went straight forward.
10 As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man; and all four had the face of a lion on the right side, and all four had the face of an ox on the left side, and all four had the face of an eagle.
11 Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each had two wings touching another, and two covering their bodies.
12 And each went straight forward; wherever the Spirit would go, they went, without turning as they moved.


13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. Fire moved back and forth among the living creatures, and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
14 And the living creatures darted back and forth, like the appearance of a flash of lightning.


15 Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel was on the ground beside each of the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.
16 The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like the gleam of beryl. All four of them had the same form, and their appearance and their workmanship was as if a wheel were within a wheel.
17 When they moved, they went in any of the four directions without turning as they moved.
18 As for their rims, they were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
19 And when the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose.
20 Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
21 When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when they stood still, the wheels stood still; and when they rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.


22 And above the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of an expanse, like the gleam of crystal, spread out above their heads.
23 And under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another. Each one also had two wings covering its body.
24 And I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
25 Then there came a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood still, they let down their wings.


26 And above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man seated on it from above.
27 And I saw something like glowing metal, like the appearance of fire all around within it, from the appearance of his waist and upward. And from the appearance of his waist and downward, I saw something like fire, and there was brightness all around him.
28 Like the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face and heard the voice of one speaking.




Chapter 2


1 Then he said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.”
2 And as he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.
3 And he said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to rebellious nations who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day.
4 And the sons are impudent and stubborn. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’
5 And whether they listen or refuse to listen—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them.


6 But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or of their words. Though briers and thorns are with you and you sit among scorpions, do not be afraid of their words or be dismayed at their faces, for they are a rebellious house.
7 And you shall speak my words to them, whether they listen or refuse to listen, for they are rebellious.
8 But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I give you.”


9 Then I looked, and behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, in it was a scroll.
10 And he spread it out before me, and it was written on the front and on the back. And written on it were words of lamentation, mourning, and woe.




Chapter 3


1 And he said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”
2 So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat.
3 And he said to me, “Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your belly with this scroll that I give you.” Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.


4 Then he said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them.
5 For you are not sent to a people of ⁸obscure speech and difficult language, but to the house of Israel—
6 not to many nations of obscure speech and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.
7 But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me. For all the house of Israel are hard-headed and stubborn of heart.
8 Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
9 Like emery harder than flint I have made your forehead. Do not be afraid of them or dismayed at their faces, for they are a rebellious house.”


10 Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, receive in your heart and hear with your ears all my words that I speak to you.
11 And go to the exiles, to the sons of your people, and speak to them. Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ whether they listen or refuse to listen.”


12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great rumbling voice: “Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place!”
13 I also heard the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, a great rumbling sound.
14 So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.


15 And I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar, and I sat where they were dwelling. And I sat there seven days, stunned among them.
16 And at the end of seven days, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
17 “Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, give them warning from me.
18 When I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you do not warn him or speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his guilt, but his blood I will require at your hand.
19 But if you warn the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die in his guilt, but you will have delivered your soul.
20 Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I place a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you have not warned him, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds that he has done shall not be remembered, but his blood I will require at your hand.
21 But if you warn the righteous man not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and you will have delivered your soul.”


22 And the hand of the LORD was upon me there, and he said to me, “Arise, go out to the plain, and there I will speak with you.”


23 So I arose and went out to the plain, and the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory that I had seen by the River Chebar, and I fell on my face.
24 Then the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and he spoke with me and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your house.
25 And you, son of man, cords will be placed upon you, and you will be bound with them so that you cannot go out among them.
26 And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious house.
27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’ He who hears, let him hear, and he who refuses, let him refuse, for they are a rebellious house.”




Chapter 4


1 “And you, son of man, take a brick and set it before you, and engrave on it a city—Jerusalem.
2 Then lay siege against it, and build a siege wall against it, and raise up a ramp against it, and set camps against it, and place battering rams all around it.
3 Then take an iron plate and set it as an iron wall between you and the city, and set your face against it, and it shall be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.
4 Then lie on your left side, and place the guilt of the house of Israel upon it. According to the number of days that you lie on it, you shall bear their guilt.
5 For I assign you a number of days, equal to the number of the years of their guilt—three hundred ninety days. Thus you shall bear the guilt of the house of Israel.
6 And when you have completed these, lie down again, but on your right side, and you shall bear the guilt of the house of Judah forty days. A day for each year I assign you, a day for each year.


7 Then you shall set your face firmly toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared, and you shall prophesy against it.
8 And I will place cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, until you have completed the days of your siege.
9 And you, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them in a single vessel and make bread out of them for yourself. You shall eat it according to the number of the days that you lie on your side—three hundred ninety days you shall eat it.
10 And your food that you eat each day shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; you shall eat it from time to time.
11 And you shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin; you shall drink it from time to time.
12 And you shall eat it as barley cake, and you shall bake it in their sight on human dung.”


13 And the LORD said, “Thus shall the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations where I will drive them.”


14 Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Look, I have never been defiled; from my youth until now I have not eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has unclean meat entered my mouth.”
15 Then he said to me, “See, I will give you cow dung instead of human dung, and you shall prepare your bread on it.”
16 Moreover, he said to me, “Son of man, behold, I am about to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. And they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and drink water by measure and in horror,
17 that they may lack bread and water, and be appalled with one another, and rot away in their guilt.”




Chapter 5


1 “And you, son of man, take a sharp sword. Use it as a barber’s razor and pass it over your head and your beard. Then take balances and divide the hair.
2 A third part you shall burn with fire in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are completed. A third part you shall strike with the sword all around the city. And a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe a sword after them.
3 And take from these a few in number and bind them in the folds of your robe.
4 And from these again take some and throw them into the fire and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will go out into all the house of Israel.”


5 Thus says the Lord GOD: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the midst of the nations, with countries all around her.
6 But she has rebelled against my judgments more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her. For they have rejected my judgments, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.
7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have multiplied your disobedience more than the nations around you, and have not walked in my statutes nor kept my judgments, nor even acted according to the rules of the nations that are around you—
8 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Look: I, even I, am against you, and I will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations.
9 And I will do with you what I have never done, and the like of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations.


10 Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments on you, and scatter all your remnant to every wind.
11 Therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, I myself will withdraw, and my eye will not spare, and I will have no pity.
12 A third of you shall die by pestilence and be consumed with famine in your midst. A third shall fall by the sword all around you. And a third I will scatter to every wind, and I will unsheathe a sword after them.
13 Then my anger shall be spent, and I will cause my wrath to rest upon them, and I will be satisfied. And they shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken in my zeal, when I have spent my wrath upon them.
14 Moreover, I will make you a ruin and a reproach among the nations that are around you, in the sight of all who pass by.


15 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror to the nations around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath and in furious rebukes—I, the LORD, have spoken—


16 when I send against you the deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. And I will increase the famine upon you and break your supply of bread.


17 I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they shall bereave you. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I, the LORD, have spoken.”




Chapter 6


1 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.
3 And say, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: See here! I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.


4 Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken. And I will cast down your slain before your idols.
5 And I will lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
6 In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste and the high places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and become desolate, and your idols broken and brought to an end, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out.
7 And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the LORD.


8 Yet I will leave a remnant, when you have some who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the lands.
9 Then those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I was crushed by their adulterous heart, which departed from me, and by their eyes, which go whoring after their idols. And they will loathe themselves for the evils that they have committed in all their abominations.
10 And they shall know that I am the LORD. I have not said in vain that I would bring this evil upon them.


11 Thus says the Lord GOD: Strike your hand and stamp your foot, and say, Alas! for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.
12 He who is far off shall die by pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them.
13 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak—the places where they offered pleasing aroma to all their idols.
14 And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate and a waste, from the wilderness to Riblah, in all their dwelling places. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.”




Chapter 7


1 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “And you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
3 Now the end is upon you, and I will send my anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring upon you all your abominations.
4 My eye shall not spare you, nor will I have pity, but I will bring your ways upon you, and your abominations shall be in your midst; then you shall know that I am the LORD.


5 Thus says the Lord GOD: A disaster—only one disaster—but look, it is coming!
6 An end has come, the end has come; it has awakened against you. Look out, it is coming!
7 Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come, the day is near—a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting on the mountains.
8 Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways; and I will bring upon you all your abominations.
9 My eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity. I will repay you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you shall know that it is I, the LORD, who strikes.


10 Look out for the day! See! It is coming! Your doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed, pride has budded.
11 Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them.
12 The time has come, the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude.
13 For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, as long as they live. For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not turn back. And because of his iniquity, none shall preserve his life.


14 They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but no one goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude.
15 The sword is outside; pestilence and famine are within. He who is in the field shall die by the sword, and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
16 And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity.
17 All hands are feeble, and all knees turn to water.
18 They put on sackcloth, and horror covers them. Shame is on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.


19 They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is treated as unclean. Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them on the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it, for it was the stumbling block of their iniquity.
20 His beautiful ornament they used for pride, and they made from it their abominable images and their detestable things. Therefore I make it an unclean thing to them.
21 And I will give it into the hand of foreigners for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they shall profane it.
22 I will turn my face from them, and they shall profane my treasured place. Robbers shall enter and profane it.


23 Forge a chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence.
24 I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places shall be profaned.
25 Anguish comes; they seek peace, but there is none.
26 Disaster comes upon disaster; rumor follows rumor. They seek a vision from the prophet, while the law perishes from the priest and counsel from the elders.
27 The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the common man tremble. According to their way I will deal with them, and by their judgments I will judge them. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.”




Chapter 8


1 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there.
2 Then I looked, and saw a form that had the appearance of a man. From what appeared to be his waist downward was fire, and from his waist upward was something like the appearance of brightness, like glowing metal.
3 And he stretched out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner gate that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.
4 And I saw that the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the valley.


5 Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north.” So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and saw, north of the altar gate, at the entrance, was this image of jealousy.
6 And he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing—the great abominations that the house of Israel is committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations.”


7 And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and I looked, and saw, there was a hole in the wall.
8 Then he said to me, “Son of man, dig through the wall.” So I dug through the wall, and I saw an entrance.
9 And he said to me, “Go in and see the wicked abominations that they are doing here.”
10 So I went in and looked, and I saw every form of creeping thing and detestable beast, and all the idols of the house of Israel, were carved on the wall all around.
11 And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up.
12 Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each in his room of images? For they say, ‘The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.’”
13 He said also to me, “You will see still greater abominations that they are committing.”


14 Then he brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of the LORD that was on the north, and I saw that women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.
15 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these.”


16 And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD, and I saw at the entrance of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, there were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east.
17 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they fill the land with violence and provoke me still further? They put the branch to their nose.
18 Therefore I also will act in wrath. My eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”




Chapter 9


1 Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Bring near the executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand.”
2 And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon for destruction in his hand. And one man among them was clothed in linen, with a writing case at his side. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.


3 Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his side.
4 And the LORD said to him, “Pass through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it.”
5 And to the others he said in my hearing, “Pass through the city after him, and strike. Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity.
6 Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no man on whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the house.


7 Then he said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out.” So they went out and struck in the city.
8 And while they were striking, and I was left alone, I fell on my face and cried out, “Ah, Lord GOD! Will you destroy all the remnant of Israel in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?”


9 Then he said to me, “The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice. For they say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see.’
10 As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will bring their way upon their head.”


11 And behold, the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his side, brought back word, saying, “I have done as you commanded me.”




Chapter 10


1 Then I looked, and saw on the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim, there appeared above them something like a sapphire stone, in appearance resembling a throne.
2 And he spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, “Go in between the whirling wheels beneath the cherubim, and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” And he went in as I watched.


3 Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.
4 Then the glory of the LORD rose up from above the cherub and moved to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD.
5 And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.


6 And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” he went in and stood beside a wheel.
7 And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it and placed it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
8 And the cherubim appeared to have the form of a man’s hand under their wings.


9 And I looked, and saw four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub. And the appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a beryl stone.
10 And as for their appearance, all four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel.
11 When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went, but in whatever direction the head faced, they followed without turning as they went.
12 And their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around—the wheels belonging to all four.
13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing “the whirling wheels.”


14 And each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, the second face was the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
15 And the cherubim rose up—these were the living creatures that I saw by the Kebar River.


16 And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them. And when the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise from the earth, the wheels also did not leave their side.
17 When they stood still, these stood still, and when they rose up, these rose up with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.


18 Then the glory of the LORD went out from the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim.
19 And the cherubim lifted up their wings and rose up from the earth before my eyes as they went out, with the wheels beside them. And they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the LORD, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.


20 These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the Kebar River, and I knew that they were cherubim.
21 Each one had four faces, and each had four wings, and beneath their wings was the likeness of human hands.
22 And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces I had seen by the Kebar River, their appearance and their whole form. Each one went straight forward.




Chapter 11


1 Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the house of the LORD, which faces east. And there at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men. And I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, officials of the people.
2 And he said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise wickedness and give evil counsel in this city.
3 They say, ‘The time is not near to build houses; this city is the pot, and we are the meat.’
4 Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man.”


5 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, “Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel, for I know the things that come into your spirit.
6 You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.
7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Your slain whom you have laid in its midst—they are the meat, and this city is the pot. But you shall be brought out of the midst of it.
8 You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, declares the Lord GOD.
9 And I will bring you out of the midst of it and give you into the hands of foreigners, and I will execute judgment upon you.
10 You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
11 This city shall not be your pot, nor shall you be the meat in the midst of it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,
12 and you shall know that I am the LORD, for you have not walked in my statutes, nor obeyed my judgments, but have acted according to the judgments of the nations that are around you.”


13 And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Will you make a complete end of the remnant of Israel?”


14 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
15 “Son of man, your brothers, your kinsmen, your fellow exiles, and all the house of Israel—all of them—are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Stay far from the LORD; to us this land is given as a possession.’
16 Therefore say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a little while in the countries where they have gone.


17 Therefore say, Thus says the Lord GOD: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
18 And they will come there and remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations.
19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
20 that they may walk in my statutes and keep my judgments and do them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
21 But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way down upon their own heads, declares the Lord GOD.”


22 Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain that is east of the city.


24 And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me.
25 And I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.




Chapter 12


1 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious house.
3 As for you, son of man, prepare for yourself baggage for exile, and go into exile by day in their sight. You shall go into exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house.


4 You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. Then in the evening you shall go out in their sight, as those do who go into exile.
5 In their sight, dig through the wall and bring your baggage out through it.
6 In their sight, you shall lift the baggage on your shoulder and carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel.”


7 So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand. In darkness I brought it out; I lifted it on my shoulder in their sight.


8 And in the morning the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
9 “Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’
10 Say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.
11 Say, ‘I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.’
12 And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage on his shoulder in the dark and go out. They shall dig through the wall to bring it out. He shall cover his face so that he cannot see the land with his eyes.
13 And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be caught in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, and there he shall die.
14 And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, and I will unsheathe the sword after them.


15 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
16 But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine, and from pestilence, so that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, and they shall know that I am the LORD.”


17 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
18 “Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and anxiety.
19 And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, so that her land may be emptied of all who are in it because of the violence of all who dwell in it.
20 And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation, and you shall know that I am the LORD.”


21 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
22 “Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails’?
23 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no longer use it as a proverb in Israel. But say to them, ‘The days are near, and the fulfillment of every vision.’
24 For there shall no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
25 For I am the LORD; I will speak whatever word I speak, and it shall be fulfilled. It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and fulfill it, declares the Lord GOD.”


26 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
27 “Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.’
28 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: None of my words will be delayed any longer, but the word that I speak will be fulfilled, declares the Lord GOD.”




Chapter 13


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are prophesying, and say to those who prophesy out of their own hearts, ‘Hear the word of the LORD!’
3 Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!
4 Your prophets, O Israel, are like foxes among ruins.
5 You have not gone up into the breaches or built up a wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in the battle on the day of the LORD.


6 They have seen false visions and lying divinations. They say, ‘Declares the LORD,’ when the LORD has not sent them, and yet they expect him to fulfill their word.
7 Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination, whenever you have said, ‘Declares the LORD,’ although I have not spoken?”


8 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have spoken falsehood and seen lying visions, therefore, I am against you, declares the Lord GOD.
9 My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel. Then you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.


10 Because they have led my people astray, saying, ‘Peace,’ when there is no peace, and because, when the people build a wall, they smear it with whitewash,
11 say to those who smear it with whitewash that it shall fall. There will be a deluge of rain, and you, O hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind shall break out.
12 And when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, ‘Where is the coating with which you smeared it?’


13 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath, and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and hailstones in wrath to make a full end.
14 And I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you shall perish in its midst, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
15 Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash. And I will say to you, ‘The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it,
16 the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace,’ declares the Lord GOD.


17 And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own hearts. Prophesy against them
18 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists and make veils for the heads of persons of every height in order to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls belonging to my people and keep your own souls alive?
19 You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death souls who should not die and keeping alive souls who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.


20 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your magic bands with which you hunt the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls you hunt go free—the souls like birds.
21 Your veils also I will tear off and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be in your hand as prey. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.


22 Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, though I have not grieved him, and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not turn from his evil way to save his life,
23 therefore you shall no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.”




Chapter 14


1 Then certain men from the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.
2 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
3 “Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts and have put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them?


4 Therefore speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Any man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and comes to the prophet—I the LORD will answer him according to it, according to the multitude of his idols,
5 in order to seize the house of Israel in their hearts, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.


6 Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations.
7 For any one of the house of Israel or of the sojourners who dwell in Israel, who separates himself from me, takes his idols into his heart, and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to a prophet to inquire of me through him—I the LORD will answer him myself.
8 And I will set my face against that man, and I will make him a sign and a proverb and cut him off from the midst of my people. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.


9 And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
10 They shall bear their punishment—the punishment of the inquirer shall be the same as the punishment of the prophet—
11 that the house of Israel may no longer go astray from me, nor defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions. Then they shall be my people, and I will be their God, declares the Lord GOD.”


12 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13 “Son of man, if a land sins against me by acting unfaithfully, and I stretch out my hand against it and break its supply of bread and send famine upon it and cut off from it man and beast,
14 even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in it, they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Lord GOD.


15 If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land and they bereave it so that it becomes a desolation, with no one passing through because of the beasts,
16 even though these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the land would be a desolation.


17 Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say, ‘Let a sword pass through the land,’ and I cut off from it man and beast,
18 even though these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they alone would be delivered.


19 Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out my wrath upon it with blood, to cut off from it man and beast,
20 even though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither son nor daughter. They would deliver only themselves by their righteousness.


21 For thus says the Lord GOD: How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my four disastrous judgments—sword, famine, wild beasts, and pestilence—to cut off from it man and beast!
22 Yet you will see, there shall be left in it survivors, sons and daughters who will be brought out. See how they will come out to you, and you will see their way and their deeds. Then you will be comforted for the disaster that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it.
23 And they will comfort you when you see their way and their deeds, and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, declares the Lord GOD.”




Chapter 15


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?
3 Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do they take a peg from it to hang any vessel on it?
4 See, it is given to the fire for fuel. The fire consumes both its ends, and its middle is charred. Is it useful for any work?
5 See, when it was whole, it was not used for any work. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it still be used for anything?


6 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
7 And I will set my face against them. Though they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them. Then you shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.
8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully, declares the Lord GOD.”




Chapter 16


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations,
3 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are from the land of the Canaanites. Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
4 As for your birth, on the day you were born, your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloth strips.
5 No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you out of compassion. You were thrown out into the open field, for you were abhorred on the day you were born.


6 And when I passed by you and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’ I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’
7 I made you flourish like a plant of the field. And you grew up and became tall and reached full adornment. Your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown, yet you were naked and bare.
8 Then I passed by you again and saw you, and behold, you were at the time for love. And I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness. I swore to you and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord GOD, and you became mine.


9 Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil.
10 I clothed you with embroidered cloth and put sandals of fine leather on your feet. I bound you with fine linen and covered you with silk.
11 And I adorned you with ornaments and put bracelets on your wrists and a chain on your neck.
12 I put a ring on your nose and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
13 Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour and honey and oil. You became exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royal splendor.
14 And your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through my splendor, which I had bestowed on you, declares the Lord GOD.


15 But you trusted in your beauty and played the harlot because of your fame, and poured out your whorings on every passerby. Your beauty became his.
16 And you took some of your garments and made for yourself colorful shrines and played the harlot on them—things such as never have been nor ever shall be.
17 You also took your beautiful jewelry of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of males and played the harlot with them.
18 And you took your embroidered garments to cover them and set my oil and my incense before them.
19 Also my bread that I gave you—I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey—you set it before them for a pleasing aroma. And so it was, declares the Lord GOD.


20 And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your whorings so small a matter
21 that you slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering by fire to them?
22 And in all your abominations and your whorings you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, wallowing in your blood.


23 And after all your wickedness—woe, woe to you! declares the Lord GOD—
24 you built yourself a vaulted chamber and made yourself a high place in every square.
25 At the head of every street you built your high place and made your beauty an abomination. You spread your legs to every passerby and multiplied your whorings.
26 You also played the harlot with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and multiplied your whorings to provoke me to anger.
27 See, therefore, how I stretched out my hand against you and diminished your portion and gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior.


28 You played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because you were not satisfied. Yes, you played the harlot with them, and still you were not satisfied.
29 You multiplied your whorings also with the land of traders, Chaldea, and even with this you were not satisfied.
30 How sick is your heart, declares the Lord GOD, when you do all these things, the work of a brazen prostitute,
31 building your vaulted chamber at the head of every street, and making your high place in every square. Yet you were not like a harlot, because you scorned payment.
32 You adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband!


33 Men give gifts to all harlots, but you gave your gifts to all your lovers and bribed them to come to you from every direction in your whorings.
34 So you were different from other women in your whorings; no one solicited you to play the harlot. You gave payment, and no payment was given to you; thus you were the opposite.


35 Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:
36 Thus says the Lord GOD, Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered through your whorings with your lovers and with all your detestable idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them,
37 therefore, see how I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated. I will gather them against you from every side and will uncover your nakedness to them, and they shall see all your nakedness.
38 And I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged, and I will bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy.


39 And I will give you into their hands, and they shall throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your high places. They shall strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewels and leave you naked and bare.
40 They shall bring up a crowd against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
41 And they shall burn your houses with fire and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. Then I will make you cease from playing the harlot, and you shall also give payment no more.


42 So I will satisfy my wrath on you, and my jealousy shall turn away from you. I will be calm and will no longer be angry.
43 Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things, see, I also will bring your way down on your own head, declares the Lord GOD. Have you not committed lewdness in addition to all your abominations?


44 Look how everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you, saying, ‘Like mother, like daughter.’
45 You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children. And you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.


46 And your elder sister is Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters.
47 Yet you have not walked in their ways nor acted according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.
48 As I live, declares the Lord GOD, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done.


49 Look here! This was the guilt of your sister Sodom: pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease were hers and her daughters', but she did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
50 And they were haughty and did an abomination before me. So I removed them when I saw it.


51 Samaria has not committed half your sins. You have multiplied your abominations beyond theirs and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations that you have done.
52 Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have made judgment favorable to your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. So be ashamed, you also, and bear your disgrace, for you have justified your sisters.


53 I will restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your fortunes among them,
54 that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all that you have done, becoming a consolation to them.
55 Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, and you and your daughters shall return to your former state.
56 Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride,
57 before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you are a reproach to the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and to the daughters of the Philistines, those all around who despise you.


58 You bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, declares the LORD.
59 For thus says the Lord GOD: I will deal with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath, breaking the covenant.


60 Yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish for you an everlasting covenant.
61 Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your sisters, both your elder and your younger, and I give them to you as daughters—but not because of your covenant.
62 I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD,
63 that you may remember and be ashamed and never open your mouth again because of your disgrace, when I atone for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord GOD.”




Chapter 17


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, propose a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel,
3 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, rich in plumage of many colors, came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar.
4 He plucked off the topmost of its young twigs and brought it to a land of merchants; he set it in a city of traders.
5 Then he took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed it beside abundant waters. He set it like a willow twig,
6 and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine. Its branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out boughs.


7 But there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage. And this vine bent its roots toward him and sent its branches toward him from the bed where it was planted, that he might water it.
8 It had been planted in good soil by abundant waters, that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine.
9 Say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers—so that all its fresh sprouts wither? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots.
10 See, it is planted, but will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it? Wither away on the bed where it grew?”


11 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
12 “Say now to the rebellious house, Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, See, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took its king and princes and brought them to him in Babylon.
13 And he took one of the royal offspring and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land,
14 that the kingdom might be brought low and not lift itself up, and that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
15 But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Can one who does such things escape? Can he break the covenant and yet escape?


16 As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke—in Babylon he shall die.
17 Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives.
18 He despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and he gave his hand and did all these things—he shall not escape.
19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely it is my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke—I will bring it down on his own head.
20 And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for the treachery he has committed against me.
21 And all the choice men in all his troops shall fall by the sword, and the survivors shall be scattered to every wind. Then you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken.”


22 Thus says the Lord GOD: I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and will plant it. I will pluck from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
23 On the mountain height of Israel I will plant it, that it may bear branches and produce fruit and become a noble cedar. And under it will dwell every kind of bird; in the shade of its branches birds of every sort will nest.
24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the LORD. I bring low the high tree, and exalt the low tree, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree flourish. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it.”




Chapter 18


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the sons are set on edge’?
3 As I live, declares the Lord GOD, you shall no longer use this proverb in Israel.
4 All lives are mine, the life of the father as well as the life of the son is mine. The soul who sins shall die.


5 But if a man is righteous and does what is just and right,
6 if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor’s wife or approach a woman during her impurity,
7 does not oppress anyone, but returns his pledge, commits no robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
8 does not lend at interest or take any profit, withholds his hand from injustice, executes true justice between man and man,
9 walks in my statutes and keeps my judgments to act faithfully—he is righteous; he shall surely live, declares the Lord GOD.


10 If he fathers a son who is violent, a shedder of blood, and who does any of these things—
11 though he himself did none of these things—who even eats upon the mountains, defiles his neighbor’s wife,
12 oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not return the pledge, lifts up his eyes to idols, commits abomination,
13 lends at interest and takes profit—shall the son then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die. His blood shall be upon himself.


14 But see here, if this man fathers a son who sees all the sins that his father has done and considers and does not do likewise—
15 who does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor’s wife,
16 does not oppress anyone, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
17 withholds his hand from wrongdoing, takes no interest or profit, keeps my judgments and walks in my statutes—he shall not die for his father's iniquity; he shall surely live.
18 As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, he shall die for his own iniquity.


19 Yet you say, ‘Why does not the son bear the guilt of the father?’ When the son has done what is just and right, and has kept all my statutes and acted faithfully, he shall surely live.
20 The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the guilt of the father, nor shall the father bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.


21 But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
22 None of the transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness that he has done, he shall live.
23 Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord GOD, rather than that he should turn from his ways and live?


24 But if a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits injustice, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered. For the unfaithfulness of which he is guilty, and for the sin he has committed, he shall die.


25 Yet you say, ‘The way of the LORD is not just.’ Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
26 When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits injustice, and dies for it, for the injustice that he has done he shall die.
27 Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he shall save his life.
28 Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions that he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
29 Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the LORD is not just.’ O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?


30 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each one according to his ways, declares the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your downfall.
31 Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, O house of Israel?
32 For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies, declares the Lord GOD. Therefore, turn and live.”




Chapter 19


1 And you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
2 and say: What was your mother? A lioness. Among lions she lay down; in the midst of young lions she raised her cubs.
3 And she brought up one of her cubs; he became a young lion. He learned to tear the prey; he devoured men.
4 Then the nations heard of him; he was caught in their pit, and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.


5 When she saw that she waited in vain, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.
6 And he prowled among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to tear the prey; he devoured men.
7 And he ravaged strongholds and laid waste their cities. The land was appalled and all who were in it, at the sound of his roaring.
8 Then the nations set against him from the provinces on every side. They spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
9 With hooks they put him in a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon. They brought him into strongholds, so that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel.


10 Your mother was like a vine in your likeness, planted by the waters. She was fruitful and full of branches by reason of abundant water.
11 And she had strong branches, fit for scepters of rulers, and her height was exalted among the clouds. It was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.
12 But it was plucked up in fury, cast down to the ground. The east wind dried up its fruit; its strong branch was torn off and withered; fire consumed it.
13 Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
14 And fire has gone out from the rod of its branches; it has consumed its fruit, so that there is no strong branch in it, a scepter for ruling.


This is a lamentation and has become a lamentation.




Chapter 20


1 And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that certain men from the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and they sat before me.
2 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
3 “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Have you come to inquire of me? As I live, I will not be inquired of by you, declares the Lord GOD.


4 Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Make known to them the abominations of their fathers,
5 and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day when I chose Israel, I lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt. I lifted up my hand to them, saying, I am the LORD your God.
6 On that day I lifted up my hand to them, that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.
7 And I said to them, Cast away every man the detestable things of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.
8 But they rebelled against me and were not willing to listen to me. They did not each cast away the detestable things of their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them to complete my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
9 But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.


10 So I brought them out of the land of Egypt and led them into the wilderness.
11 And I gave them my statutes and made known to them my judgments, by which, if a man does them, he shall live.
12 Moreover, I gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not walk in my statutes and they rejected my judgments—by which, if a man does them, he shall live—and they greatly profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a complete end of them.
14 But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned before the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.


15 I also lifted up my hand to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them—a land flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands—
16 because they rejected my judgments and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths, for their heart went after their idols.
17 Yet my eye spared them from destruction, and I did not make a complete end of them in the wilderness.


18 And I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
19 I am the LORD your God. Walk in my statutes, keep my judgments, and do them.
20 And sanctify my Sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.
21 But the children rebelled against me. They did not walk in my statutes, nor did they keep my judgments to do them (by which, if a man does them, he shall live). They profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
22 Nevertheless, I withdrew my hand and acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.


23 Also I lifted up my hand to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands,
24 because they had not done my judgments, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were fixed on their fathers' idols.
25 So I gave them statutes that were not good and judgments by which they could not live,
26 and I defiled them through their gifts, in making all their firstborn pass through the fire, that I might devastate them, in order that they might know that I am the LORD.


27 Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: In this also your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have been unfaithful to me.
28 For when I had brought them into the land that I lifted up my hand to give them, then they saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and there they offered their sacrifices and presented the provocation of their offering. There also they made their sweet aroma and poured out their drink offerings.
29 Then I said to them, What is this high place to which you go? So its name is called Bamah to this day.


30 Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will you defile yourselves in the manner of your fathers and go whoring after their detestable things?
31 And when you offer your gifts and make your sons pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. So shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.


32 And what comes into your mind shall never happen, when you say, ‘We will be like the nations, like the families of the lands, serving wood and stone.’


33 As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out I will be king over you.
34 And I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out.
35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.
36 Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, declares the Lord GOD.
37 And I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
38 And I will purge out from among you the rebels and those who transgress against me. I will bring them out from the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.


39 As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD: Go, serve every one of you his idols, now and hereafter—if you will not listen to me—but my holy name you shall no longer profane with your gifts and with your idols.


40 For on my holy mountain, on the mountain height of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land. There I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your holy things.
41 As a pleasing aroma I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the lands where you have been scattered. And I will be sanctified through you in the sight of the nations.
42 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land that I lifted up my hand to give to your fathers.
43 And there you shall remember your ways and all your deeds by which you have defiled yourselves, and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have done.
44 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I deal with you for the sake of my name, not according to your evil ways or according to your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD.”


45 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
46 “Son of man, set your face toward the south, and preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land of the Negev.
47 And say to the forest of the Negev, Hear the word of the LORD: Thus says the Lord GOD, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree. The blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it.
48 And all flesh shall see that I, the LORD, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.”
49 Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! They say of me, ‘Is he not speaking parables?’”




Chapter 21


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and preach against the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel.
3 And say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: Pay attention here! I am against you and will draw my sword from its sheath and will cut off from you both righteous and wicked.
4 Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword shall go out from its sheath against all flesh from south to north.
5 And all flesh shall know that I the LORD have drawn my sword from its sheath; it shall not return anymore.


6 And you, son of man, groan with shaking loins, and with bitterness groan before their eyes.
7 And when they say to you, ‘Why do you groan?’ you shall say, ‘Because of the report that is coming. Every heart will melt, and all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Look! It is coming, and it will be fulfilled,’ declares the Lord GOD.”


8 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
9 “Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the LORD: Say,


A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished,
10 sharpened to make a great slaughter,
polished that it may flash like lightning!


Shall we rejoice? You have despised the rod, my son, with everything of wood.
11 So the sword is given to be polished, that it may be grasped in the hand. It is sharpened and polished to be put in the hand of the slayer.
12 Cry and wail, son of man, for it is against my people; it is against all the princes of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Therefore strike your thigh.


13 For it is a test, and what if even the rod that despises shall be no more? declares the Lord GOD.
14 And you, son of man, prophesy and strike your hands together. Let the sword be doubled the third time. It is the sword of the slain. It is the sword of the great slaughter, surrounding them.
15 That their hearts may melt and many stumble. At all their gates I have set the point of the sword. Ah! It is made like lightning; it is sharpened for slaughter.


16 Gather yourself. Go to the right, set yourself; or go to the left, wherever your edge is directed.
17 I also will strike my hands together, and I will satisfy my wrath. I the LORD have spoken.”


18 And the word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
19 “As for you, son of man, mark out two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come. Both shall come out of the same land. And make a signpost; make it at the head of the road to the city.
20 Mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon and to fortified Jerusalem in Judah.
21 For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two roads, to practice divination. He shakes the arrows, he consults the household idols, he looks at the liver.
22 In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem: to set battering rams, to open the mouth for slaughter, to lift the voice with a battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up ramps, to build a siege wall.
23 But to them it will seem like false divination—they have sworn oaths—but he will bring their guilt to remembrance, that they may be taken.


24 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that your sins are seen in all your deeds—because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand.
25 And you, O profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day, the time of the final punishment, has come—
26 thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Things shall not remain as they are. Exalt what is low, and bring low what is high.
27 A ruin, a ruin, a ruin I will make it. This also shall not be, until he comes—the one to whom judgment belongs—and I will give it to him.


28 And you, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the sons of Ammon and concerning their reproach. Say,


A sword, a sword is drawn for the slaughter,
it is polished to consume and to flash like lightning—
29 while they see for you false visions,
while they divine lies for you—
to place you on the necks of the profane wicked,
whose day has come, the time of final punishment.


30 Return it to its sheath.
In the place where you were created,
in the land of your origin,
I will judge you.
31 And I will pour out my indignation upon you;
I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath,
and I will give you into the hands of brutal men,
skilled to destroy.
32 You shall be fuel for the fire;
your blood shall be in the midst of the land;
you shall be remembered no more,
for I the LORD have spoken.”




Chapter 22


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Now you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the city of blood? Then you shall make known to her all her abominations.
3 And you shall say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: A city that sheds blood in her midst, that her time may come, and that makes idols for herself to defile herself!
4 You have become guilty by the blood that you have shed, and defiled by the idols that you have made. And you have brought your days near and have come to your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mockery to all the lands.
5 Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you, O defiled of name, full of tumult.


6 Behold, the princes of Israel, every one according to his power, have been in you to shed blood.
7 Father and mother are treated with contempt in you; the sojourner suffers extortion in your midst; the fatherless and the widow are wronged in you.
8 You have despised my holy things and have profaned my Sabbaths.
9 Slanderous men are in you to shed blood, and in you they eat on the mountains; in your midst they commit lewdness.
10 In you a man uncovers his father's nakedness; in you they violate a woman during her impurity.
11 One commits abominations with his neighbor’s wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; another violates his sister, his father's daughter.
12 In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take interest and profit and make gain of your neighbors by extortion. But me you have forgotten,’ declares the Lord GOD.


13 ‘Behold, I strike my hand at your dishonest gain that you have made, and at the blood that has been in your midst.
14 Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.
15 And I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the lands, and I will consume your uncleanness from you.
16 And you shall be profaned in yourself in the sight of the nations, and you shall know that I am the LORD.’”


17 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
18 “Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace—they are dross of silver.
19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Because you have all become dross, therefore, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
20 As one gathers silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into the midst of a furnace, to blow fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will put you there and melt you.
21 I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst of it.
22 As silver is melted in the midst of a furnace, so you shall be melted in the midst of it, and you shall know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath upon you.’”


23 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
24 “Son of man, say to her, ‘You are a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
25 The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey. They have devoured lives, they take treasure and precious things, they have made many widows in her midst.
26 Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and they have hidden their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
27 Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain.
28 And her prophets have daubed them with whitewash, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, “Thus says the Lord GOD, when the LORD has not spoken.”
29 The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy and have extorted from the sojourner without justice.


30 And I sought for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none.
31 Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD.’”




Chapter 23


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.
3 They prostituted themselves in Egypt; they prostituted themselves in their youth. There their breasts were pressed, and there their virgin bosoms were handled.
4 Their names were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister. And they became mine and bore sons and daughters. As for their names: Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.


5 Oholah prostituted herself while she was mine, and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians, warriors
6 clothed in blue, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
7 She bestowed her harlotries upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them, and with all whom she lusted after; with all their idols she defiled herself.
8 She did not give up her harlotries that she had begun in Egypt, for in her youth men had lain with her and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their whoring upon her.


9 Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted.
10 They uncovered her nakedness, they took her sons and daughters, and they killed her with the sword. And she became a byword among women, when judgment had been executed on her.


11 Her sister Oholibah saw it, yet she was more corrupt in her lust than she, and her whoring was worse than the whoring of her sister.
12 She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and officials, warriors clothed in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.
13 And I saw that she was defiled; they both went the same way.
14 But she carried her whorings still further. She saw men portrayed on the wall, images of the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,
15 wearing belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them having the appearance of officers, like Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea.
16 When she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
17 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their lust. And after she was defiled by them, she turned from them in disgust.
18 When she carried on her whoring openly and exposed her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned in disgust from her sister.
19 Yet she multiplied her whorings, remembering the days of her youth, when she prostituted herself in the land of Egypt
20 and lusted after her lovers there, whose members were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of stallions.
21 Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom because of your youthful breasts.


22 Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD: See here, I will stir up your lovers against you, from whom you turned in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side:
23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and officials, all of them officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.
24 And they shall come against you from the north with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples. They shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet. And I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.
25 And I will set my jealousy against you, and they shall deal with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors shall fall by the sword. They shall seize your sons and your daughters, and your survivors shall be consumed by fire.
26 They shall also strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewels.
27 Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and your whoring begun in the land of Egypt, so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.


28 For thus says the Lord GOD: I will give you into the hand of those whom you hate, into the hand of those from whom you turned in disgust,
29 and they shall deal with you in hatred and take away all the fruit of your labor and leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your whoring shall be uncovered. Your lewdness and your harlotry
30 have brought this upon you, because you prostituted yourself with the nations and defiled yourself with their idols.
31 You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.


32 Thus says the Lord GOD:


‘You shall drink your sister’s cup,
that is deep and large;
you shall be laughed at and held in derision,
for it holds much.
33 You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow,
a cup of horror and desolation,
the cup of your sister Samaria.
34 You shall drink it and drain it out,
and gnaw its shards
and tear your breasts;
for I have spoken,
declares the Lord GOD.’


35 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, you yourself shall bear the penalty for your lewdness and your harlotry.’”


36 And the LORD said to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.
37 For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. With their idols they have committed adultery, and even their children whom they bore to me they have sacrificed to them as food.
38 Moreover, this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my Sabbaths.
39 For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, they came into my sanctuary on the same day to profane it. This is how they behaved in my house!


40 Furthermore, they sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came. For them you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments.
41 You sat on a stately couch with a table spread before it, on which you had set my incense and my oil.
42 The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness, and they put bracelets on the arms of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads.


43 Then I said of her who was worn out by adultery, ‘Now they will continue with her acts of harlotry, even her!’
44 For they went in to her, as men go in to a prostitute. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, lewd women.
45 But righteous men shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.


46 For thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Bring up a host against them and give them over to terror and plunder.
47 And the host shall stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters and burn their houses with fire.
48 Thus I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done.
49 And they shall return your lewdness upon you, and you shall bear the penalty for your idolatry. Then you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.’”




Chapter 24


1 And the word of the LORD came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, saying,
2 “Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
3 And speak a parable to the rebellious house and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD:


‘Set on the pot, set it on;
also pour water into it.
4 Put in it pieces of meat,
every good piece, thigh and shoulder;
fill it with the choicest bones.
5 Take the choicest of the flock,
pile the bones under it;
make it boil well;
also let its bones seethe in it.’


6 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD:
‘Woe to the bloody city,
to the pot whose corrosion is in it,
and whose corrosion has not gone out of it!
Empty it piece by piece,
no lot has fallen upon it.
7 For her blood is in her midst;
she set it on the bare rock;
she did not pour it out on the ground,
to cover it with dust.
8 That it might cause wrath to come up to take vengeance,
I have set her blood on the bare rock,
so that it would not be covered.’


9 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD:
‘Woe to the bloody city!
I also will make the pile great.
10 Heap on the logs, kindle the fire,
boil the meat well, mix in the spices,
and let the bones be burned.
11 Then set it empty upon its coals,
that it may become hot and its bronze may glow,
and that its filthiness may be melted in it,
its corrosion consumed.
12 She has wearied herself with toil,
yet her abundant corrosion has not gone out of her;
her corrosion is in the fire.
13 In your lewd impurity, because I tried to cleanse you
but you would not be cleansed from your filthiness,
you shall not be cleansed again
until I have satisfied my fury upon you.


14 I, the LORD, have spoken.
It shall come to pass; I will do it.
I will not go back; I will not spare; I will not relent.
According to your ways and according to your deeds
they will judge you,’ declares the Lord GOD.”


15 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
16 “Son of man, I am about to take from you the delight of your eyes with a blow. Yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down.
17 Groan silently; do not make mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache, and do not eat the bread of mourners.”


18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And the next morning I did as I was commanded.


19 And the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are doing?”
20 Then I said to them, “The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
21 ‘Say to the house of Israel, “Thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Look here! I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes and the desire of your soul. And your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind shall fall by the sword.
22 And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your mustache or eat the bread of mourners.
23 Your turbans shall be on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You shall not mourn or weep, but you shall rot away in your iniquities and groan to one another.
24 Thus Ezekiel shall be a sign to you; according to all that he has done you shall do. When this happens, then you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.’”’


25 As for you, son of man, surely on the day when I take from them their stronghold—the joy of their glory, the delight of their eyes and the longing of their soul—and also their sons and their daughters,
26 on that day a fugitive will come to you to report it to your ears.
27 On that day your mouth will be opened to the fugitive, and you shall speak and no longer be mute. So you shall be a sign to them, and they shall know that I am the LORD.”




Chapter 25


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, set your face toward the sons of Ammon and prophesy against them.
3 Say to the sons of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD: Because you said, ‘Aha!’ against my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile,
4 therefore, behold, I am giving you to the sons of the east for a possession. They shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you; they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.
5 I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the sons of Ammon a resting place for flocks. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.


6 For thus says the Lord GOD: Because you clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the malice of your soul against the land of Israel,
7 therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand against you, and I will give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and make you perish from the lands. I will destroy you, and you shall know that I am the LORD.”


8 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Moab and Seir say, ‘Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,’
9 therefore, behold, I will open the flank of Moab from the cities, from its cities on its frontier, the glory of the land—Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim.
10 I will give it along with the sons of Ammon to the sons of the east as a possession, so that the sons of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations,
11 and I will execute judgments upon Moab. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.


12 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Edom has acted in vengeance against the house of Judah and has grievously offended in taking vengeance on them,
13 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off from it man and beast, and I will make it desolate from Teman; even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword.
14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall act in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath, and they shall know my vengeance, declares the Lord GOD.


15 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the Philistines have acted in vengeance and have taken vengeance with malice of soul to destroy with everlasting enmity,
16 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast.
17 I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes. Then they shall know that I am the LORD, when I lay my vengeance upon them.”




Chapter 26


1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, because Tyre has said concerning Jerusalem, ‘Aha! She is broken, the gateway of the peoples; it has swung open to me; I shall be filled, now that she is laid waste,’
3 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I am against you, O Tyre, and will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.
4 They shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers, and I will scrape her soil from her and make her a bare rock.
5 She shall be in the midst of the sea a place for spreading nets, for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD, and she shall become plunder for the nations.
6 And her daughters on the mainland shall be killed by the sword. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.


7 For thus says the Lord GOD: See how I will bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, with horsemen and an army, even a great company.
8 He shall kill with the sword your daughters on the mainland. He shall set up a siege wall against you and cast up a mound against you, and raise a roof of shields against you.
9 He shall direct the blow of his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.
10 From the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you; at the sound of the horseman and the wheel and the chariot, your walls shall shake when he enters your gates, as men enter a breached city.
11 With the hooves of his horses he shall trample all your streets; he shall kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars shall fall to the ground.
12 They shall plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they shall break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; and your stones and your timber and your soil they shall cast into the midst of the waters.
13 And I will put an end to the sound of your songs, and the sound of your lyres shall be heard no more.
14 I will make you a bare rock; you shall be a place for spreading nets. You shall never be rebuilt, for I the LORD have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.


15 Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre: Will not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when slaughter is made in your midst?
16 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. They shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit on the ground and tremble every moment and be appalled at you.
17 And they shall raise a lament over you and say to you,


How you have perished, you who were inhabited from the seas,
O city renowned, who was strong on the sea,
she and her inhabitants, who put their terror on all her inhabitants!
18 Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your fall,
and the coastlands that are by the sea are dismayed at your departure.


19 For thus says the Lord GOD: When I make you a desolate city, like cities that are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep over you, and the great waters cover you,
20 then I will make you go down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old, and I will make you dwell in the lowest parts of the earth, like the waste places of old, with those who go down to the pit, so that you will not be inhabited; but I will set beauty in the land of the living.
21 I will bring you to a terrible end, and you shall be no more. Though you be sought for, you will never be found again, declares the Lord GOD.”




Chapter 27


1 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Now you, son of man, lift up a lamentation over Tyre,
3 and say to Tyre, who dwells at the entrances of the sea, who is the merchant of the peoples to many coastlands, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD:
O Tyre, you have said, “I am perfect in beauty.”
4 Your borders are in the heart of the seas;
your builders perfected your beauty.
5 They made all your planks of juniper from Senir;
they took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
6 Of oaks from Bashan they made your oars;
they made your deck of ivory inlaid in boxwood from the coasts of Cyprus.
7 Fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail,
serving as your banner;
blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah
was your awning.
8 The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers;
your wise men, O Tyre, were aboard;
they were your pilots.
9 The elders of Gebal and her craftsmen were aboard to caulk your seams;
all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you
to trade in your merchandise.
10 Persia, Lud, and Put were in your army,
your men of war;
they hung the shield and helmet in you;
they gave you splendor.
11 The men of Arvad and Helek were on your walls all around,
and valiant men were stationed in your towers;
they hung their shields on your walls all around;
they perfected your beauty.
12 Tarshish traded with you
because of your great wealth of every kind;
silver, iron, tin, and lead
they exchanged for your merchandise.
13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you;
they exchanged slaves and bronze vessels for your merchandise.
14 From Beth-togarmah they exchanged horses, war horses, and mules for your merchandise.
15 The men of Dedan traded with you;
many coastlands were your own special market;
they brought you ivory tusks and ebony as your payment.
16 Syria traded with you because of your great abundance of goods;
emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies they gave you for your merchandise.
17 Judah and the land of Israel traded with you;
they exchanged wheat of Minnith, cakes, honey, oil, and balm for your merchandise.
18 Damascus traded with you because of your great abundance of goods,
because of your great wealth of every kind;
wine of Helbon and white wool they exchanged for your merchandise.
19 Dan and Javan from Uzal traded for your goods;
wrought iron, cassia, and calamus were among your merchandise.
20 Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding.
21 Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were merchants of your hand;
they traded with you in lambs, rams, and goats.
22 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you;
the best of all spices, precious stones, and gold they exchanged for your merchandise.
23 Haran, Canneh, Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you.
24 They traded with you in choice garments, in cloaks of blue and embroidered work,
and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among your merchandise.
25 The ships of Tarshish carried your merchandise,
and you were filled and heavily laden
in the heart of the seas.
26 Your rowers have brought you into great waters;
the east wind has broken you
in the heart of the seas.


27 Your wealth, your wares, your merchandise, your mariners, your pilots,
your caulkers, your dealers in merchandise,
and all your men of war who are in you,
with all your company that is in your midst,
sink into the heart of the seas
on the day of your downfall.
28 At the sound of the cry of your pilots
the countryside shakes,
29 and all who handle the oar
abandon their ships.
The mariners and all the pilots of the sea
stand on the shore
30 and raise their voices for you
and cry out bitterly.
They cast dust on their heads
and wallow in ashes;
31 they make themselves bald for you
and gird themselves with sackcloth,
and they weep for you in bitterness of soul,
with bitter mourning.


32 In their wailing they raise a lamentation for you
and lament over you:
‘Who is like Tyre,
like one destroyed in the midst of the sea?
33 When your wares came from the seas,
you satisfied many peoples;
with your abundant wealth and merchandise
you enriched the kings of the earth.


34 Now you are wrecked by the seas,
in the depths of the waters;
your merchandise and all your company
have sunk with you.
35 All the inhabitants of the coastlands
are appalled at you,
and their kings are horribly afraid;
their faces are convulsed.
36 The merchants among the peoples hiss at you;
you have come to a dreadful end
and shall be no more forever.’”




Chapter 28


1 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord GOD:
Because your heart is proud, and you have said, ‘I am a god;
I sit in the seat of gods, in the heart of the seas,’
yet you are a man, and not a god,
though you make your heart like the heart of a god—
3 behold, you are wiser than Daniel;
no secret is hidden from you;
4 by your wisdom and your understanding
you have made wealth for yourself,
and have gathered gold and silver
into your treasuries;
5 by the greatness of your wisdom in your trade
you have increased your wealth,
and your heart has become proud in your wealth—
6 therefore thus says the Lord GOD:
Because you make your heart like the heart of a god.


7 Therefore, look how I will bring foreigners upon you,
the most ruthless of the nations;
and they shall draw their swords
against the beauty of your wisdom
and defile your splendor.
8 They shall bring you down to the pit,
and you shall die the death of the slain
in the heart of the seas.


9 Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’
in the presence of those who kill you,
though you are but a man, and no god,
in the hand of those who pierce you?
10 You shall die the death of the uncircumcised
by the hand of foreigners;
for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.”


11 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
12 “Son of man, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord GOD:
You were the signet of perfection,
full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
13 You were in Eden, the garden of God;
every precious stone was your covering,
sardius, topaz, and diamond,
beryl, onyx, and jasper,
sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle;
and crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings.
On the day that you were created
they were prepared.
14 You were an anointed guardian cherub;
I placed you;
you were on the holy mountain of God;
in the midst of the stones of fire you walked.
15 You were blameless in your ways
from the day you were created,
till unrighteousness was found in you.
16 In the abundance of your trade
you were filled with violence in your midst,
and you sinned;
so I cast you as a profane thing
from the mountain of God,
and I destroyed you,
O guardian cherub,
from the midst of the stones of fire.


17 Your heart was proud because of your beauty;
you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor.
I cast you to the ground;
I exposed you before kings,
to feast their eyes on you.
18 By the multitude of your iniquities,
in the unrighteousness of your trade,
you profaned your sanctuaries;
so I brought fire out from your midst;
it consumed you,
and I turned you to ashes on the earth
in the sight of all who saw you.
19 All who know you among the peoples
are appalled at you;
you have come to a dreadful end
and shall be no more forever.”


20 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
21 “Son of man, set your face toward Sidon,
and prophesy against her,
22 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD:
Look how I am against you, O Sidon,
and I will manifest my glory in your midst.
And they shall know that I am the LORD
when I execute judgments in her
and manifest my holiness in her;
23 for I will send pestilence into her,
and blood into her streets;
and the slain shall fall in her midst,
by the sword that is against her on every side;
and they shall know that I am the LORD.
24 And for the house of Israel there shall be no more a brier to prick or a thorn to hurt them
from all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt.
Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.


25 Thus says the Lord GOD: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered,
and manifest my holiness in them in the sight of the nations,
then they shall dwell in their own land that I gave to my servant Jacob.
26 And they shall dwell securely in it, and build houses, and plant vineyards.
They shall dwell securely, when I execute judgments upon all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt.
Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.”




Chapter 29


1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
3 Speak, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD:
See, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt,
the great dragon lying in the midst of his Nile streams,
who says, ‘My Nile is mine, and I made it.’


4 I will put hooks in your jaws,
and I will make the fish of your Nile streams stick to your scales,
and I will draw you up out of the midst of your Nile streams,
with all the fish of your Nile streams
that stick to your scales.
5 And I will cast you out into the wilderness,
you and all the fish of your Nile streams;
on the open field you shall fall;
you shall not be gathered or buried.
I have given you as food to the beasts of the earth
and to the birds of the heavens.


6 Then all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD.
Because you have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel,
7 when they grasped you with the hand, you broke,
and tore all their shoulders;
and when they leaned on you, you broke,
and made all their loins to shake.


8 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will bring a sword upon you,
and will cut off from you man and beast,
9 and the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste.
Then they will know that I am the LORD.
Because you said, ‘The Nile is mine, and I made it,’
10 therefore, behold, I am against you and against your Nile streams,
and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation,
from Migdol to Syene,
as far as the border of Cush.


11 No foot of man shall pass through it,
and no foot of beast shall pass through it;
it shall be uninhabited forty years.
12 And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated lands,
and her cities shall be a desolation forty years
among cities that are laid waste.
I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations,
and disperse them through the countries.


13 For thus says the Lord GOD: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered,
14 and I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin,
and there they shall be a lowly kingdom.
15 It shall be the lowliest of the kingdoms,
and never again exalt itself above the nations;
and I will make them so small that they will never again rule over the nations.
16 And it shall never again be the confidence of the house of Israel,
recalling their iniquity, when they turn to follow them.
Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.”


17 And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
18 “Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre;
every head was made bald, and every shoulder rubbed bare;
yet neither he nor his army received wages from Tyre
for the labor that he had performed against her.


19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Look! I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
and he shall carry off her wealth
and seize her spoil and take her plunder;
and it shall be the wages for his army.


20 I have given him the land of Egypt as his payment for which he labored,
because they worked for Me,
declares the Lord GOD.
21 On that day I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel,
and I will open your mouth among them.
Then they will know that I am the LORD.”




Chapter 30


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord GOD:
Wail, ‘Alas for the day!’
3 For the day is near,
the day of the LORD is near;
it will be a day of clouds,
a time of doom for the nations.
4 A sword shall come upon Egypt,
and anguish shall be in Cush,
when the slain fall in Egypt,
and her wealth is carried away,
and her foundations are torn down.
5 Cush, and Put, and Lud, and all Arabia, and Libya, and the sons of the land of the covenant shall fall with them by the sword."


6 Thus says the LORD:
"Those who support Egypt shall fall,
and the pride of her strength shall come down;
from Migdol to Syene they shall fall in it by the sword,"
declares the Lord GOD.
7 "And they shall be desolate in the midst of desolated lands,
and her cities shall be in the midst of cities that are laid waste.
8 Then they will know that I am the LORD,
when I have set fire to Egypt,
and all her helpers are broken.
9 On that day messengers shall go forth from Me in ships to terrify confident Cush,
and anguish shall be on them in the day of Egypt;
for behold, it comes."


10 Thus says the Lord GOD:
"I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt
by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
11 He and his people with him, the most ruthless of the nations,
shall be brought in to destroy the land;
and they shall draw their swords against Egypt
and fill the land with the slain.
12 And I will make the Nile streams dry,
and will sell the land into the hand of evil men;
and I will make the land and all that fills it desolate
by the hand of foreigners.
I, the LORD, have spoken."


13 Thus says the Lord GOD:
"I will destroy the idols
and put an end to the images in Memphis;
there shall no longer be a prince from the land of Egypt;
so I will put fear in the land of Egypt.
14 I will make Pathros desolate,
and will set fire to Zoan,
and will execute judgments on Thebes.
15 I will pour out My wrath on Pelusium,
the stronghold of Egypt,
and will cut off the multitude of Thebes.
16 And I will set fire to Egypt;
Pelusium shall writhe in anguish,
Thebes shall be breached,
and Memphis shall face enemies daily.
17 The young men of On and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword,
and the women shall go into captivity.
18 At Tehaphnehes the day shall be dark,
when I break there the yoke bars of Egypt,
and the pride of her strength comes to an end;
she shall be covered by a cloud,
and her daughters shall go into captivity.
19 So I will execute judgments on Egypt,
and they will know that I am the LORD."


20 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
21 “Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt;
and behold, it has not been bound up to heal,
to be wrapped with a bandage,
that it may become strong to hold the sword."


22 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD:
"Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt,
and I will break his arms,
both the strong arm and the one that was broken,
and I will cause the sword to fall from his hand.
23 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations
and disperse them through the countries.
24 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon,
and put My sword in his hand,
but I will break the arms of Pharaoh,
and he will groan before him
with the groanings of a mortally wounded man.
25 Thus I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon,
but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall.
Then they will know that I am the LORD,
when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon,
and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt.
26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations
and disperse them through the countries.
Then they will know that I am the LORD.”




Chapter 31


1 In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude:
‘Whom are you like in your greatness?


3 Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon,
with beautiful branches and forest shade,
and of towering height;
its top was among the clouds.
4 The waters nourished it;
the deep made it grow tall,
making its rivers flow
around the place of its planting,
sending its channels
to all the trees of the field.
5 Therefore it towered higher
than all the trees of the field;
its boughs grew large and its branches long
from abundant water in its shoots.
6 All the birds of the sky nested in its boughs;
under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth,
and in its shade lived all great nations.


7 It was beautiful in its greatness,
in the length of its branches;
for its roots went down
to abundant waters.
8 The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it,
nor could the fir trees compare with its boughs;
the plane trees were not like its branches;
no tree in the garden of God
was its equal in beauty.
9 I made it beautiful
with the multitude of its branches,
and all the trees of Eden, in the garden of God, envied it.


10 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD:
Because it towered high
and set its top among the clouds,
and its heart was lifted up in its height,
11 I gave it into the hand of the ruler of the nations;
he will surely deal with it;
I drove it out for its wickedness.
12 Foreigners, the most ruthless of nations,
cut it down and left it.
Its branches fell on the mountains
and in all the valleys;
its boughs lay broken
in all the ravines of the land;
and all the peoples of the earth
went away from its shade and left it.


13 On its fallen trunk
all the birds of the sky dwell,
and on its branches
all the beasts of the field are.
14 This happened so that
no trees by the waters
may grow tall to their top among the clouds,
and so that no trees that drink water
may stand in height among the clouds;
for they are all given over to death,
to the depths of the earth,
among the children of man,
to those who go down to the pit.


15 Thus says the Lord GOD:
On the day it went down to the grave
I caused mourning;
I covered the deep for it,
and I restrained its rivers,
and the great waters were held back;
I clothed Lebanon in black for it,
and all the trees of the field fainted because of it.
16 I made the nations quake
at the sound of its fall,
when I cast it down to the grave
with those who go down to the pit.
And all the trees of Eden,
the choice and best of Lebanon,
all that drink water,
were comforted in the depths of the earth.
17 They also went down to the grave with it,
to those slain by the sword,
yes, those who were its arm,
who lived under its shade among the nations.


18 Whom are you like in glory and greatness
among the trees of Eden?
Yet you shall be brought down
with the trees of Eden
to the depths of the earth;
you shall lie among the uncircumcised,
with those slain by the sword.
This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,’
declares the Lord GOD.”




Chapter 32


1 In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, take up a lament over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him:
‘You likened yourself to a young lion of the nations,
but you are like a dragon in the seas;
you burst forth in your rivers,
troubled the waters with your feet,
and fouled their rivers.’


3 Thus says the Lord GOD:
‘I will spread my net over you
with a company of many peoples,
and they will haul you up in my dragnet.
4 I will leave you on the land;
I will cast you on the open field;
I will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you,
and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with you.
5 I will lay your flesh on the mountains
and fill the valleys with your carcass.
6 I will drench the land
to the mountains with your flowing blood,
and the ravines will be filled with you.


7 When I extinguish you,
I will cover the heavens and darken their stars;
I will cover the sun with a cloud,
and the moon will not give its light.
8 All the bright lights of the sky
I will make dark over you,
and I will put darkness on your land,’
declares the Lord GOD.


9 ‘I will trouble the hearts of many peoples
when I bring your destruction among the nations,
to lands that you have not known.
10 I will cause many peoples to be appalled at you,
and their kings will shudder in horror because of you,
when I brandish my sword before them;
and they will tremble continually,
every man for his own life,
on the day of your downfall.’


11 For thus says the Lord GOD:
‘The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon you.
12 I will cause your multitude to fall
by the swords of the mighty ones,
all of them ruthless among the nations;
and they will devastate the pride of Egypt,
and all its multitude will be destroyed.
13 I will destroy all its beasts
from beside many waters;
the foot of man will not trouble them anymore,
nor will the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
14 Then I will make their waters settle,
and will cause their rivers to run like oil,’
declares the Lord GOD.


15 ‘When I make the land of Egypt desolate,
and the land is stripped of all that fills it,
when I strike all who live in it,
then they will know that I am the LORD.
16 This is a lament; it shall be chanted;
the daughters of the nations shall chant it;
over Egypt and all its multitude they shall chant it,’
declares the Lord GOD.”


17 In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
18 “Son of man, wail over the multitude of Egypt,
and bring it down,
her and the daughters of mighty nations,
to the depths of the earth,
with those who go down to the pit.


19 ‘Whom do you surpass in beauty?
Go down and be laid
with the uncircumcised.’
20 They shall fall
in the midst of those slain by the sword;
she is given over to the sword;
they have drawn her away and all her multitudes.
21 The mighty chiefs shall speak to him
out of the midst of the grave,
with his helpers:
‘They have gone down;
they lie still, the uncircumcised,
slain by the sword.’


22 Assyria is there,
and all her company;
their graves are all around her,
all of them slain, fallen by the sword,
23 whose graves are set
in the recesses of the pit,
and her company is all around her grave,
all of them slain, fallen by the sword,
who spread terror in the land of the living.


24 Elam is there,
and all her multitude around her grave,
all of them slain, fallen by the sword,
who went down uncircumcised
to the depths of the earth,
who spread their terror in the land of the living;
and they bear their disgrace
with those who go down to the pit.
25 They have made her a bed among the slain
with all her multitude;
her graves are all around it;
all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword;
for they spread their terror in the land of the living,
and they bear their disgrace
with those who go down to the pit;
in the midst of the slain they are placed.


26 Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude are there;
their graves are all around them,
all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword,
for they spread their terror in the land of the living.
27 They do not lie with the mighty
who have fallen from among the uncircumcised,
who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war,
whose swords were laid under their heads,
and whose iniquities are on their bones,
for the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living.
28 But you will be broken
in the midst of the uncircumcised,
and lie with those slain by the sword.


29 Edom is there,
her kings and all her princes,
who for all their might are laid with those slain by the sword;
they will lie with the uncircumcised,
and with those who go down to the pit.


30 All the princes of the north are there,
and all the Sidonians,
who have gone down in shame with the slain,
for the terror that they caused by their might;
they lie uncircumcised
with those slain by the sword,
and bear their disgrace
with those who go down to the pit.
31 Pharaoh will see them
and be comforted over all his multitude,
Pharaoh and all his army,
slain by the sword,
declares the Lord GOD.
32 For I spread my terror
in the land of the living;
and he will be laid
in the midst of the uncircumcised,
with those slain by the sword,
Pharaoh and all his multitude,
declares the Lord GOD.”




Chapter 33


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 "Son of man, speak to the sons of your people and say to them, 'When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them and set him as their watchman,
3 and he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people,
4 then if anyone who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
5 He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his life.
6 But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any one of them, that man is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.'"


7 "So you, son of man, I have set you as a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.
8 If I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you shall surely die,' and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
9 But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your life."


10 "And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel: 'Thus you have spoken, saying, Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we rot away in them. How then can we live?'
11 Say to them, 'As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn back, turn back from your evil ways, for why will you die, O house of Israel?'"


12 "And you, son of man, say to the sons of your people, 'The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him when he transgresses, and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it when he turns from his wickedness. And the righteous shall not be able to live by his righteousness in the day that he sins.
13 Though I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, yet if he trusts in his righteousness and does injustice, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered, but in his injustice that he has done, he shall die.
14 And though I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' yet if he turns from his sin and does what is just and right,
15 if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has taken by robbery, walks in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
16 None of the sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him; he has done what is just and right; he shall surely live."


17 "Yet the sons of your people say, 'The way of the Lord is not just,' when it is their way that is not just.
18 When the righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it.
19 And when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he shall live by it.
20 Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his ways."


21 In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me and said, "The city has been struck down."
22 Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the fugitive came, and he had opened my mouth by the time the man came to me in the morning, so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.


23 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
24 "Son of man, those who live in these waste places in the land of Israel keep saying, 'Abraham was one man, yet he got possession of the land; but we are many, surely the land is given us to possess.'
25 Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: You eat flesh with the blood and lift up your eyes to your idols and shed blood—shall you then possess the land?
26 You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbor’s wife—shall you then possess the land?'"


27 "Say this to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword, and whoever is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in strongholds and in caves shall die by pestilence.
28 And I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and her proud might shall come to an end, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that none will pass through.
29 Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations that they have committed.'"


30 "As for you, son of man, your sons, those who talk together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, speak to one another, each to his brother, saying, 'Come, and hear what the word is that comes from the LORD.'
31 And they come to you as a people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words but they will not do them, for with lustful talk in their mouths they act; their heart is set on their gain.
32 And you see that you are to them like one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument, for they hear your words, but they will not do them.
33 When this comes—and it will certainly come!—then they will know that a prophet has been among them."




Chapter 34


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to them, even to the shepherds, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock?
3 You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fattened ones, but you do not feed the flock.
4 The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the injured you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back, the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them.
5 So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd, and they became food for all the wild beasts.'
6 My flock wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill. My flock was scattered over all the face of the earth, with none to search or seek for them."


7 "Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
8 'As I live,' declares the Lord GOD, 'surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd, and because my shepherds did not search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed my flock,'
9 therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
10 'Thus says the Lord GOD, look how I am against the shepherds, and I will require my flock at their hand and put a stop to their feeding the flock. No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, that they may not be food for them.'"


11 "For thus says the Lord GOD: 'I myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out.
12 As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered, so will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.
13 And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. And I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the land.
14 I will feed them with good pasture, and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land. There they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel.
15 I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down,' declares the Lord GOD.
16 'I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice.'"


17 "As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord GOD: 'I judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and male goats.
18 Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture, and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest with your feet?
19 And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet?'"


20 "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: 'I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
21 Because you push with side and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, until you have scattered them abroad,
22 I will save my flock; they shall no longer be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep.
23 And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.
24 And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them. I, the LORD, have spoken.'"


25 "I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild beasts from the land, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forests.
26 And I will make them and the places all around my hill a blessing, and I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing.
27 And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land. And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke, and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them.
28 They shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the land devour them. They shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.
29 And I will provide for them splendid vegetation so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the reproach of the nations.
30 And they shall know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people,' declares the Lord GOD.
31 'And you are my sheep, human sheep of my pasture, and I am your God,' declares the Lord GOD."


Chapter 35


1 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
3 and say to it, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you a desolation and a waste.
4 I will lay your cities waste, and you shall become a desolation, and you shall know that I am the LORD.


5 Because you cherished perpetual enmity and gave over the sons of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of the final punishment,
6 therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you. Because you did not hate bloodshed, therefore blood shall pursue you.
7 I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation, and I will cut off from it all who come and go.
8 And I will fill its mountains with the slain. On your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain with the sword shall fall.
9 I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.


10 Because you said, These two nations and these two lands shall be mine, and we will take possession of them, although the LORD was there,
11 therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will deal with you according to the anger and envy that you showed because of your hatred against them. And I will make myself known among them, when I judge you.
12 And you shall know that I am the LORD. I have heard all the revilings that you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour.
13 And you magnified yourselves against me with your mouth and multiplied your words against me; I heard it.


14 Thus says the Lord GOD: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
15 As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will deal with you; you shall be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, yes, all of it. Then they will know that I am the LORD.




Chapter 36


1 And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, "O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.
2 Thus says the Lord GOD: 'Because the enemy said of you, "Aha!" and, "The ancient heights have become our possession,"'
3 therefore prophesy, and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "Because, indeed, they made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side, so that you became a possession to the rest of the nations, and you were taken up on the lips of talkers and the gossip of the people,"
4 therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: "Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, the ravines and the valleys, the desolate wastes and the deserted cities, which have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations all around,"
5 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: "Surely I have spoken in my hot jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave my land to themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, that they might plunder its pastureland."'
6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you have borne the reproach of the nations."
7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: "I swear that the nations that are all around you shall themselves bear their reproach."'"


8 "But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit for my people Israel, for they are soon to come.
9 For behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown.
10 And I will multiply men on you, the whole house of Israel, all of it. The cities shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt.
11 And I will multiply on you man and beast, and they shall multiply and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
12 Yes, I will cause men to walk upon you, my people Israel, and they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and you shall no longer bereave them of children."'


13 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "Because they say to you, You devour men and you bereave your nation of children,
14 therefore you shall no longer devour men and no longer bereave your nation of children, declares the Lord GOD.
15 And I will no longer let you hear the reproach of the nations, and you shall no longer bear the disgrace of the peoples, and you shall no longer cause your nation to stumble, declares the Lord GOD."'"


16 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
17 "Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their deeds. Their ways before me were like the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.
18 So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed in the land, and for the idols with which they had defiled it.
19 I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. In accordance with their ways and their deeds I judged them.
20 But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that it was said of them, These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to go out of his land.
21 But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came."


22 "Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came.
23 And I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations shall know that I am the LORD," declares the Lord GOD, "when through you I display my holiness before their eyes.
24 For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land.
25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleanness, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.
26 And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
27 And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.
28 You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
29 And I will deliver you from all your uncleanness. And I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you.
30 I will make the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field abundant, that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations.
31 Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations.
32 It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel."


33 Thus says the Lord GOD: "On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt.
34 And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by."
35 And they will say, "This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.
36 Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I am the LORD; I have rebuilt the ruined places and replanted that which was desolate. I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will do it."'"


37 Thus says the Lord GOD: "This also I will let the house of Israel ask me to do for them: to increase their men like a flock.
38 Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they will know that I am the LORD."




Chapter 37


1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley, and it was full of bones.
2 He made me pass all around them, and I saw there were very many on the surface of the valley, and I saw that they were very dry.
3 And he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I said, “O Lord GOD, you know.”
4 Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, 'O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.
5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.
6 And I will put sinews on you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the LORD.'”


7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, and there was a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
8 And I looked, and saw that there were sinews on them, and flesh came upon them, and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.
9 Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.”'"
10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.


11 Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off.’
12 Therefore prophesy and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "Watch how I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
13 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people.
14 And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken, and I have done it, declares the LORD.”'c


15 The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
16 “And you, son of man, take one stick and write on it: ‘For Judah and the sons of Israel his companions.’ Then take another stick and write on it: ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel his companions.’
17 Then join them to one another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.
18 And when the sons of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Will you not declare to us what you mean by these?’
19 say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "I am about to take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions, and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them into one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
20 And the sticks on which you write shall be in your hand before their eyes."'


21 Then say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "I will take the sons of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from all around, and bring them into their own land.
22 And I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all. And they shall no longer be two nations, and no longer be divided into two kingdoms.
23 They shall not defile themselves any more with their idols, or with their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions. But I will save them from all their backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. So they shall be my people, and I will be their God."


24 "My servant David shall be king over them, and they all shall have one shepherd. They shall walk in my rules and be careful to observe my statutes.
25 They shall dwell in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, in which your fathers lived. They and their children and their children’s children shall dwell there forever, and David my servant shall be their prince forever.
26 I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore.
27 My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
28 Then the nations shall know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore.”'"




Chapter 38


1 The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2 “Son of man, set your face against Gog of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
3 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
4 I will turn you about and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them wielding swords—
5 Persia, Cush, and Put are with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
6 Gomer and all his hordes; Beth-Togarmah from the far north and all his hordes—many peoples with you."


7 "Get ready, and prepare yourself, you and all your companies that are assembled about you, and be a guard for them.
8 After many days you will be mustered. In the latter years you will come into the land that is restored from the sword, whose inhabitants have been gathered from many peoples to the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste. Its people were brought out from the nations and now dwell securely, all of them.
9 You will advance, coming like a storm. You will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your hordes, and many peoples with you."


10 Thus says the Lord GOD: "On that day thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil plan.
11 You will say, ‘I will go up against the land of unwalled villages. I will fall upon the quiet people who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having no bars or gates’—
12 to seize spoil and carry off plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and against a people gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who dwell at the center of the earth.
13 Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its young lions will say to you, ‘Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your company to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to seize great spoil?’"


14 "Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day when my people Israel dwell securely, will you not know it?
15 You will come from your place out of the far north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great assembly and a mighty army.
16 You will come up against my people Israel like a cloud covering the land. In the latter days I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when through you, O Gog, I am sanctified before their eyes."


17 Thus says the Lord GOD: "Are you he of whom I spoke in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for years that I would bring you against them?
18 But on that day, the day that Gog comes against the land of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, my wrath will be aroused.
19 In my zeal and in my blazing fury I declare: On that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
20 The fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep on the ground, and all the men who are on the face of the earth, shall quake at my presence. The mountains shall be thrown down, the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground."


21 "I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Lord GOD. Every man’s sword will be against his brother.
22 With pestilence and with bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him, and I will rain upon him and his hordes and the many peoples who are with him torrential rains and hailstones, fire and brimstone.
23 So I will magnify myself and sanctify myself and make myself known in the eyes of many nations. Then they shall know that I am the LORD."




Chapter 39


1 And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say, "Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
2 And I will turn you about and drive you on, and bring you up from the far north, and lead you against the mountains of Israel.
3 Then I will strike your bow from your left hand, and I will cause your arrows to fall from your right hand.
4 You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your hordes and the peoples who are with you. I will give you to birds of prey of every kind and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
5 You shall fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.
6 I will send fire on Magog and on those who dwell securely in the coastlands, and they shall know that I am the LORD."


7 "And my holy name I will make known in the midst of my people Israel, and I will not let my holy name be profaned anymore. And the nations shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
8 Behold, it is coming, and it shall be done, declares the Lord GOD. This is the day of which I have spoken.
9 Then those who dwell in the cities of Israel shall go out and make fires of the weapons and burn them, shields and bucklers, bows and arrows, clubs and spears, and they shall make fires of them for seven years.
10 So that they will not take wood from the field or cut down any from the forests, for they will make fires of the weapons. They will seize the spoil of those who despoiled them and plunder those who plundered them, declares the Lord GOD."


11 "On that day I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the Valley of the Travelers, east of the sea. It will block the travelers, for there Gog and all his multitude will be buried. It will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog.
12 For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them, in order to cleanse the land.
13 All the people of the land will bury them, and it will bring them renown on the day that I am glorified, declares the Lord GOD.
14 They will set apart men to continually pass through the land and bury those travelers remaining on the face of the land, so as to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make their search.
15 And when these pass through the land, and one sees a human bone, then he will set up a marker by it, till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog.
16 (Hamonah is also the name of the city.) Thus they shall cleanse the land.


17 As for you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: Speak to the birds of every sort and to all beasts of the field: Assemble and come, gather from every side to the sacrifice that I am preparing for you, a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh and drink blood.
18 You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth—of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bulls, all of them fat beasts of Bashan.
19 And you shall eat fat till you are full, and drink blood till you are drunk, at the sacrifice that I am preparing for you.
20 And you shall be filled at my table with horses and charioteers, with mighty men and all kinds of warriors, declares the Lord GOD.


21 And I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid on them.
22 The house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God, from that day forward.
23 And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity, because they dealt treacherously with me. So I hid my face from them and gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell by the sword.
24 I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their transgressions, and hid my face from them.


25 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and I will be jealous for my holy name.
26 They shall forget their shame and all the treachery they have practiced against me, when they dwell securely in their land with none to make them afraid,
27 when I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from their enemies’ lands, and through them I show myself holy in the sight of many nations.
28 Then they shall know that I am the LORD their God, because I sent them into exile among the nations and then gathered them into their own land. I will leave none of them remaining among the nations anymore.
29 And I will not hide my face anymore from them, when I pour out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD.




Chapter 40


1 In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that very day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me there.
2 In visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city to the south.
3 When he brought me there, I saw there was a man whose appearance was like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring reed in his hand. And he was standing in the gateway.
4 And the man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you; for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel."


5 And I saw there was a wall all around the outside of the temple area, and in the man’s hand was a measuring reed of six long cubits, each being a cubit and a handbreadth. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed, and the height, one reed.
6 Then he went into the gateway facing east, going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep.
7 And the side chambers, one reed long and one reed broad; and the space between the side chambers, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end, one reed.
8 Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and its jambs, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end.
9 Then he measured the vestibule of the gate, eight cubits; and its jambs, two cubits. And the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end.
10 And there were three side chambers on either side of the east gate. The three were of the same size, and the jambs on either side were of the same size.
11 Then he measured the breadth of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the length of the gateway, thirteen cubits.
12 There was a barrier before the side chambers of one cubit on either side, and the side chambers were six cubits on either side.
13 Then he measured the gate from the roof of one side chamber to the roof of the other, a breadth of twenty-five cubits; the openings faced each other.
14 He measured also the jambs, sixty cubits. And to the jamb was the court of the gate all around.
15 From the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits.
16 And the gateway had windows all around, narrowing inward toward the side chambers and toward their jambs, and likewise the vestibule had windows all around the inside. And on the jambs were palm trees.


17 Then he brought me into the outer court, and I saw there were chambers and a pavement, all around the court. Thirty chambers faced the pavement.
18 And the pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates. This was the lower pavement.
19 Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, one hundred cubits on the east side and on the north side.


20 As for the gate that faced toward the north, belonging to the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth.
21 Its side chambers, three on either side, and its jambs and its vestibule were of the same size as those of the first gate; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
22 And its windows and its vestibule and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the gate that faced toward the east. And seven steps led up to it, and its vestibule was before them.
23 And opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to the inner court. And he measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.


24 And he led me toward the south, and I saw there was a gate on the south. And he measured its jambs and its vestibule; they had the same size as the others.
25 And there were windows all around in it and in its vestibule, like the other windows. The length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
26 And there were seven steps leading up to it, and its vestibule was before them, and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side.
27 And there was a gate on the south of the inner court. And he measured from gate to gate on the south, one hundred cubits.


28 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it was of the same size as the others.
29 Its side chambers, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and it had windows all around. The length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
30 And there were vestibules all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad.
31 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps.


32 Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate; it was of the same size as the others.
33 Its side chambers, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and it had windows all around. The length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
34 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its jambs, on either side, and its stairway had eight steps.


35 Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it; it had the same size as the others,
36 its side chambers, its jambs, and its vestibule; and it had windows all around. The length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
37 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its jambs, on either side, and its stairway had eight steps.


38 There was a chamber with its door by the vestibule of the gate, where the burnt offering was to be washed.
39 And in the vestibule of the gate were two tables on either side, on which the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering were to be slaughtered.
40 And on the outside of the vestibule, as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables.
41 Four tables were on either side of the gate, eight tables, on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered.
42 And there were four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long and a cubit and a half broad and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered.
43 And hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened all around within. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid.


44 On the outside of the inner gateway there were two chambers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate facing south, the other at the side of the south gate facing north.
45 And he said to me, This chamber that faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple,
46 and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who alone of the sons of Levi may come near to the LORD to minister to him.


47 And he measured the court, a square, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits broad. And the altar was in front of the temple.


48 Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the jambs of the vestibule, five cubits on either side. And the breadth of the gate was fourteen cubits, and the sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side.
49 The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the breadth twelve cubits, and people would go up to it by ten steps. And there were pillars beside the jambs, one on either side.




Chapter 41


1 Then he brought me to the nave and measured the jambs; six cubits broad on one side, and six cubits broad on the other side was the breadth of the jambs.
2 And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on either side. And he measured its length, forty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits.
3 Then he went inside and measured the jambs of the entrance, two cubits, and the entrance, six cubits, and the sidewalls of the entrance, seven cubits on either side.
4 And he measured the length of the room, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, beyond the nave. And he said to me, "This is the Most Holy Place."


5 Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick, and the breadth of the side chambers, four cubits, all around the temple.
6 And the side chambers were in three stories, one above the other, thirty in each story. There were offsets all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that they should not be supported by the wall of the temple.
7 And it became broader as it wound upward to the side chambers, because the temple was enclosed upward all around the temple. Therefore the temple had a broad area upward, and so one went up from the lowest story to the top story through the middle story.
8 I also saw that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six long cubits.
9 The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. The free space between the side chambers of the temple
10 and the other chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side.
11 And the doors of the side chambers opened on the free space, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. And the breadth of the free space was five cubits all around.


12 The building that was facing the separate yard on the west side was seventy cubits broad, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.
13 Then he measured the temple, one hundred cubits long; and the yard and the building with its walls, one hundred cubits long;
14 also the breadth of the east front of the temple and the yard, one hundred cubits.


15 Then he measured the length of the building facing the yard that was at the back, and its galleries on either side, one hundred cubits. The nave of the temple and the inner rooms and the vestibules of the court,
16 the thresholds and the narrow windows and the galleries all around the three of them, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, from the floor up to the windows (now the windows were covered),
17 to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. And on all the walls all around, inside and outside, was a measured pattern.
18 It was carved of cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Every cherub had two faces:
19 the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on all the temple all around.
20 From the floor to above the door, cherubim and palm trees were carved; thus the wall of the nave.


21 The doorposts of the nave were squared, and the front of the sanctuary was in appearance like the other.
22 The altar of wood was three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits broad. Its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that is before the LORD.
23 The nave and the sanctuary had two doors.
24 The doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves for each door.
25 And on the doors of the nave were carved cherubim and palm trees, such as were carved on the walls. And there was a canopy of wood in front of the vestibule outside.
26 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on either side, on the sidewalls of the vestibule, the side chambers of the temple, and the canopies.




Chapter 42


1 Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north, and he brought me to the chamber that was opposite the separate yard and opposite the building to the north.
2 The length of the building facing north was one hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits.
3 Opposite the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement that belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.
4 And before the chambers ran a passage ten cubits broad inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors faced north.
5 Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle stories of the building.
6 For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the courts. Therefore the upper chambers were set back more than the lower and the middle ones from the ground.
7 And the wall that was outside, opposite the chambers, toward the outer court facing the chambers, its length was fifty cubits.
8 For the chambers facing the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite the temple were a hundred cubits long.
9 And below these chambers was an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court.


10 In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, facing the separate yard and facing the building, there were chambers,
11 with a passage before them. They were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits and arrangements and doors.
12 As were the doors of the chambers on the south, there was an entrance at the head of the passage, the passage before the corresponding wall toward the east, as one enters them.


13 Then he said to me, "The north chambers and the south chambers, which face the separate yard, are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, for the place is holy.
14 When the priests enter, they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court without laying there the garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments before they go near to that which belongs to the people."


15 Now when he had finished measuring the inner temple area, he brought me out by the gate that faced east, and measured it all around.
16 He measured on the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around.
17 He measured on the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around.
18 He measured on the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
19 Then he turned to the west side and measured, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
20 He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall all around, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits broad, to make a separation between the holy and the common.




Chapter 43


1 Then he brought me to the gate, the gate that faces east.
2 And suddenly the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the way of the east, and his voice was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.
3 The vision I saw was like the vision that I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and like the vision that I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
4 And the glory of the LORD came into the temple by the way of the gate that faces east.
5 The Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.


6 Then I heard one speaking to me from the temple, while the man stood beside me.
7 And he said to me, Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no longer defile my holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their harlotry or by the corpses of their kings at their high places,
8 by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them. They defiled my holy name by the abominations they committed, so I consumed them in my anger.
9 Now let them put away their harlotry and the corpses of their kings far from me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.


10 As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities, and let them measure the plan.
11 And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple, its arrangement, its exits and entrances, its entire form, all its statutes and all its laws. Write it in their sight, so that they may observe its whole design and all its statutes, and perform them.
12 This is the law of the temple: upon the top of the mountain the whole area all around it shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple.


13 These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): its base shall be a cubit high and a cubit broad, and its border on its edge all around one span. This shall be the height of the base of the altar.
14 From the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits; and the breadth of the ledge, one cubit. From the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits; and the breadth of the ledge, one cubit.
15 The altar hearth shall be four cubits high, and from the altar hearth upward there shall be four horns.
16 The altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad, square in its four sides.
17 The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad, on its four sides, with a border of half a cubit around it, and its base a cubit all around. And its steps shall face east.


18 And he said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: These are the ordinances for the altar on the day it is made, for offering burnt offerings upon it and for sprinkling blood upon it.
19 You shall give to the Levitical priests of the seed of Zadok, who draw near to me to minister to me, declares the Lord GOD, a young bull for a sin offering.
20 You shall take some of its blood and put it on its four horns, on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border all around; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.
21 You shall take the bull for the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.
22 On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering, and they shall cleanse the altar as they cleansed it with the bull.
23 When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without blemish and a ram from the flock without blemish.
24 You shall offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall throw salt upon them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD.


25 For seven days you shall prepare daily a goat for a sin offering. They shall also prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish.
26 For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it, and so consecrate it.
27 When these days are completed, on the eighth day and onward the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on the altar, and I will accept you, declares the Lord GOD.




Chapter 44


1 Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east, and it was shut.
2 And the LORD said to me, This gate shall remain shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, for the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered by it; therefore it shall remain shut.
3 As for the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the same way.


4 Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house, and I looked, and saw that the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD, and I fell on my face.
5 And the LORD said to me, Son of man, pay attention with your eyes, and listen with your ears to all that I say to you concerning all the statutes of the house of the LORD and all its laws. Pay attention to the entrance of the house and to all the exits of the sanctuary.


6 And you shall say to the rebellious house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Enough of all your abominations, O house of Israel,
7 in that you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offered my food, the fat and the blood. Thus you have broken my covenant by all your abominations.
8 You have not kept charge of my holy things, but you have set others to keep my charge in my sanctuary in your place.


9 Thus says the Lord GOD: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter my sanctuary, none of all the foreigners who are among the sons of Israel.


10 But the Levites who went far from me when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, shall bear their punishment.
11 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house and ministering in the house. They shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
12 Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have lifted my hand against them, declares the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their punishment.
13 They shall not come near to me to serve me as priests, nor come near any of my holy things or the most holy things; but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they committed.
14 Yet I will appoint them as keepers of the charge of the house, for all its service and for all that is done in it.


15 But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of my sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me. They shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, declares the Lord GOD.
16 They shall enter my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge.


17 And when they enter the gates of the inner court, they shall wear linen garments; they shall have no wool upon them while they minister in the gates of the inner court and within.
18 They shall have linen turbans upon their heads and linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not wear anything that causes sweat.
19 When they go out into the outer court, to the people, they shall take off the garments in which they minister and leave them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, so that they do not transmit holiness to the people with their garments.


20 They shall not shave their heads, nor let their hair grow long; they shall carefully trim their hair.
21 Neither shall any priest drink wine when he enters the inner court.
22 And they shall not take as wife a widow or one divorced from her husband, but only a virgin of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.
23 And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and show them how to discern between the unclean and the clean.
24 In a dispute, they shall stand as judges, and judge it according to my ordinances. They shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts, and they shall sanctify my Sabbaths.


25 They shall not come near any dead man to defile themselves; however, for father or for mother, for son or for daughter, for brother or for sister who has had no husband, they may defile themselves.
26 And after he is cleansed, they shall count seven days for him.
27 And on the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, declares the Lord GOD.


28 And it shall be for them as an inheritance: I am their inheritance, and you shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.
29 They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.
30 The first of all the firstfruits of every kind, and every contribution of every kind from all your contributions, shall belong to the priests; you shall also give the priest the first of your dough, that a blessing may rest upon your house.
31 The priests shall not eat any bird or animal that has died naturally or been torn by beasts.




Chapter 45


1 When you allot the land as an inheritance, you shall set apart a contribution to the LORD, a holy portion of the land. Its length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits, and its width ten thousand. It shall be holy throughout its entire extent.
2 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary a square five hundred by five hundred cubits, with fifty cubits of open space around it.
3 From this measured area you shall measure a length of twenty-five thousand and a width of ten thousand. In it shall be the sanctuary, the most holy place.
4 It shall be the holy portion of the land; it shall belong to the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who draw near to minister to the LORD. It shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.
5 An area twenty-five thousand long and ten thousand wide shall belong to the Levites, the ministers of the house. They shall have twenty chambers as their possession.


6 You shall also assign a possession for the city, five thousand wide and twenty-five thousand long, beside the holy contribution; it shall belong to all the house of Israel.


7 And the prince shall have the land on both sides of the holy contribution and the possession of the city, alongside the holy contribution and the city possession, on the west and on the east. Its length shall correspond to one of the tribal portions, from the western border to the eastern border.
8 This shall be his land as his possession in Israel. And my princes shall no longer oppress my people, but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.


9 Thus says the Lord GOD: Enough, O princes of Israel! Remove violence and oppression, and execute justice and righteousness. Stop your evictions of my people, declares the Lord GOD.
10 You shall have honest scales, an honest ephah, and an honest bath.
11 The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, so that the bath may contain a tenth of a homer, and the ephah a tenth of a homer; their measure shall be according to the homer.
12 The shekel shall be twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be your mina.


13 This is the contribution that you shall make: a sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat, and a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley,
14 and as the fixed portion of oil, one-tenth of a bath from each cor of oil (the cor is a homer of ten baths, for ten baths are a homer),
15 and one sheep from each flock of two hundred, from the watering places of Israel, for a grain offering, a burnt offering, and peace offerings, to make atonement for them, declares the Lord GOD.
16 All the people of the land shall contribute to this offering for the prince in Israel.


17 It shall be the prince’s duty to provide the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the drink offerings, at the feasts, the new moons, and the Sabbaths, at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He shall provide the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.


18 Thus says the Lord GOD: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary.
19 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the house, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the doorposts of the gate of the inner court.
20 And so you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance; so you shall make atonement for the house.


21 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall observe the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
22 On that day the prince shall provide for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.
23 And during the seven days of the feast he shall provide seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily as a burnt offering to the LORD, and a male goat daily for a sin offering.
24 He shall provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull, an ephah for each ram, and a hin of oil for each ephah.


25 In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall provide like these, for seven days, for the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the oil.




Chapter 46


1 Thus says the Lord GOD: The gate of the inner court that faces east shall be shut during the six working days, but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
2 The prince shall enter by way of the porch of the gate from outside and shall stand by the gatepost, while the priests prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate and then go out; but the gate shall not be shut until evening.
3 The people of the land shall also worship at the entrance of that gate before the LORD on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.


4 The burnt offering that the prince shall offer to the LORD on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish.
5 And the grain offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the grain offering for the lambs as much as he is able to give, and a hin of oil for each ephah.
6 On the day of the new moon he shall offer a young bull without blemish, six lambs, and a ram; all without blemish.
7 And he shall provide a grain offering, an ephah for the bull, an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs as much as he is able to give, and a hin of oil for each ephah.


8 When the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go out by the same way.
9 But when the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate, and he who enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate. He shall not return by way of the gate through which he entered, but shall go out opposite it.
10 The prince shall be in their midst; when they go in, he shall go in, and when they go out, he shall go out.


11 At the feasts and the appointed seasons, the grain offering shall be an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as much as he is able to give, and a hin of oil for each ephah.
12 When the prince provides a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him, and he shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out, the gate shall be shut.


13 You shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning you shall provide it.
14 You shall also provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, one-sixth of an ephah, and one-third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to the LORD continually, a perpetual statute.
15 Thus they shall provide the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil morning by morning, as a continual burnt offering.


16 Thus says the Lord GOD: If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.
17 But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall belong to him until the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince. His inheritance shall belong to his sons; it shall be theirs.
18 The prince shall not take any of the people’s inheritance by oppression, thrusting them out of their possession; he shall give his sons their inheritance from his own possession, so that none of my people shall be scattered from his possession.


19 Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, to the holy chambers of the priests, which faced north; and I saw that there was a place at the far west end.
20 He said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out into the outer court and so transmit holiness to the people.


21 Then he brought me out into the outer court and led me across to the four corners of the court; and in every corner of the court there was another court.
22 In the four corners of the court there were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; these four corner courts were of the same size.
23 Around inside them was a ledge of stone all around, and boiling places were made under the ledges all around.
24 Then he said to me, These are the kitchens where those who minister at the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.




Chapter 47


1 Then he brought me back to the entrance of the house, and I saw that water was flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the front of the house faced east. The water was flowing down from under the right side of the house, south of the altar.
2 Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces east; and I saw that water was trickling out on the right side.
3 When the man went out eastward with the measuring line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and led me through the water, water that was ankle-deep.
4 Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water that was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand and led me through water that was waist-deep.
5 Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed.
6 And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen this? Then he brought me back along the bank of the river.


7 When I returned, I saw that on the bank of the river there were very many trees on one side and on the other.
8 Then he said to me, This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, and enters the sea. When it enters the sea, the waters will be healed.
9 And every living creature that swarms wherever the river goes will live, and there will be very many fish, for this water goes there, and the waters of the sea are healed, and everything will live wherever the river goes.
10 And it will come to pass that fishermen will stand beside it; from En-gedi to En-eglaim they will spread out nets. Their fish will be of many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea - exceedingly many.
11 But its swamps and its marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt.
12 And by the river on its banks, on one side and on the other, will grow every kind of tree for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail. They will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing.


13 Thus says the Lord GOD: This shall be the boundary by which you shall divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.
14 You shall divide it equally, each one like his brother, for I swore to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.


15 This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the Great Sea by the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Zedad,
16 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which lies between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.
17 So the boundary shall be from the sea to Hazar-enan, on the border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This is the north side.


18 On the east side, between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan, between Gilead and the land of Israel, you shall measure from the north border to the eastern sea. This is the east side.


19 On the south side, toward the south, it shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Brook of Egypt and to the Great Sea. This is the south side toward the south.


20 On the west side, the Great Sea shall be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This is the west side.


21 So you shall divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel.
22 You shall divide it by lot for an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners who reside among you and who have begotten children among you. They shall be to you as native-born among the sons of Israel; with you they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
23 In whatever tribe the foreigner resides, there you shall give him his inheritance, declares the Lord GOD.




Chapter 48


1 Now these are the names of the tribes: Beginning from the northern frontier beside the way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, as far as Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus toward the north beside Hamath, they shall have sides from the east side to the west side—Dan, one portion.


2 Beside the territory of Dan, from the east side to the west side—Asher, one portion.
3 Beside the territory of Asher, from the east side to the west side—Naphtali, one portion.
4 Beside the territory of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side—Manasseh, one portion.
5 Beside the territory of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side—Ephraim, one portion.
6 Beside the territory of Ephraim, from the east side to the west side—Reuben, one portion.
7 Beside the territory of Reuben, from the east side to the west side—Judah, one portion.


8 Beside the territory of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the contribution that you shall offer: twenty-five thousand cubits in breadth, and in length the same as one of the portions, from the east side to the west side; the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.


9 The portion that you shall offer to the LORD shall be twenty-five thousand in length and ten thousand in breadth.
10 And these shall be the allotments for the holy portion: for the priests, on the north twenty-five thousand in length, and on the west ten thousand in breadth, and on the east ten thousand in breadth, and on the south twenty-five thousand in length; and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst of it.
11 It shall be for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from Me; they shall have it as a most holy portion beside the territory of the Levites.


12 And alongside the border of the priests the Levites shall have twenty-five thousand in length and ten thousand in breadth; the whole length shall be twenty-five thousand and the breadth ten thousand.
13 And they shall not sell or exchange any of it; they shall not alienate the firstfruits of the land, for it is holy to the LORD.


14 The five thousand that are left in breadth over against the twenty-five thousand shall be for common use, for the city, for dwellings, and for pasture land; and the city shall be in its midst.
15 These shall be its measurements: the north side four thousand five hundred, the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred.
16 And the pasture land of the city shall extend two hundred fifty cubits to the north, two hundred fifty cubits to the south, two hundred fifty cubits to the east, and two hundred fifty cubits to the west.


17 The remainder in length alongside the holy contribution shall be ten thousand eastward and ten thousand westward; it shall be alongside the holy contribution, and its produce shall be food for those who serve the city.
18 And those who serve the city shall serve it from all the tribes of Israel.
19 The whole contribution shall be twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand; you shall set apart the holy contribution, along with the possession of the city.


20 The remainder on both sides of the holy contribution and the possession of the city shall belong to the prince, extending on the west side and on the east side of the twenty-five thousand of the contribution as far as the borders of the tribal portions; it shall belong to the prince, and the holy contribution and the sanctuary of the house shall be in its midst.
21 Moreover, from the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city, which are in the midst of that which belongs to the prince, the area between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall belong to the prince.


22 As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side—Benjamin, one portion.
23 Beside the territory of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side—Simeon, one portion.
24 Beside the territory of Simeon, from the east side to the west side—Issachar, one portion.
25 Beside the territory of Issachar, from the east side to the west side—Zebulun, one portion.
26 Beside the territory of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side—Gad, one portion.


27 And beside the territory of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Brook of Egypt, to the Great Sea.
28 This is the land that you shall allot as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, declares the Lord GOD.


29 These are the exits of the city: On the north side, which is four thousand five hundred cubits in length,
30 three gates: the gate of Reuben, the gate of Judah, and the gate of Levi—the gates of the city shall be named after the tribes of Israel.


31 On the east side, four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates: the gate of Joseph, the gate of Benjamin, and the gate of Dan.


32 On the south side, four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates: the gate of Simeon, the gate of Issachar, and the gate of Zebulun.


33 On the west side, four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates: the gate of Gad, the gate of Asher, and the gate of Naphtali.


34 The circumference of the city shall be eighteen thousand cubits; and the name of the city from that day shall be, "The LORD Is There."﻿Daniel


Chapter 1


1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it.
2 The LORD gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the vessels of the house of God, and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god. He brought the vessels into the treasury of his god.


3 Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, the chief of his eunuchs, to bring some of the sons of Israel, both of the royal family and of the nobility,
4 youths without blemish, of good appearance and skillful in all wisdom, knowledgeable and understanding science, and capable of serving in the king’s palace, and to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.
5 The king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s delicacies and of the wine which he drank. They were to be trained for three years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king.
6 Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, from the sons of Judah.
7 The chief of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar, to Hananiah Shadrach, to Mishael Meshach, and to Azariah Abednego.


8 But Daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s delicacies or with the wine which he drank. So he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
9 Now God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs,
10 but the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink. Why should he see your faces looking more haggard than the other youths your age? Then you would endanger my head with the king.”


11 Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
12 “Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.
13 Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king’s delicacies be observed by you, and treat your servants according to what you see.”
14 So he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days.
15 At the end of ten days, their appearance was better and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king’s delicacies.
16 So the steward took away their delicacies and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables.


17 As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.


18 At the end of the days when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them before Nebuchadnezzar.
19 The king spoke with them, and among them all, none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they stood before the king.
20 In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom.
21 Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.




Chapter 2


1 In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams. His spirit was troubled, and his sleep left him.
2 The king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.
3 The king said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.”
4 Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic: “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will show the interpretation.”
5 The king answered the Chaldeans, “The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be made a heap of ruins.
6 But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation.”
7 They answered a second time and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”
8 The king answered and said, “I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see that my command is firm.
9 If you do not make the dream known to me, there is but one decree for you. For you have conspired to speak lying and deceitful words to me until I change my mind. Instead, you must tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation.”


10 The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth who can declare the king’s matter, for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or Chaldean.
11 The thing that the king asks is difficult, and no one can declare it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”
12 Because of this the king was angry and very furious, and he commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be killed.
13 So the decree went forth that the wise men should be killed, so they also sought Daniel and his companions to kill them.


14 Then Daniel replied with counsel and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.
15 He answered and said to Arioch the king’s officer, “Why is the decree of the king so urgent?” Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel.
16 So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him time, so that he could declare the interpretation to the king.


17 Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,
18 and he urged them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
19 Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
20 Daniel answered and said:


“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,
for wisdom and might belong to Him.
21 He changes the times and the seasons;
He removes kings and sets up kings;
He gives wisdom to the wise
and knowledge to those who understand.
22 He reveals the deep and hidden things;
He knows what is in the darkness,
and light dwells with Him.
23 To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise,
for You have given me wisdom and might,
and have now made known to me what we asked of You,
for You have made known to us the matter of the king.”


24 Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said to him, “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.”
25 Then Arioch brought Daniel in before the king quickly and said thus to him: “I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation.”
26 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?”
27 Daniel answered the king and said, “The mystery that the king has asked, no wise men, enchanters, magicians, or diviners are able to declare to the king.
28 But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the distant future. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these:


29 To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, and He who reveals mysteries made known to you what shall be.
30 But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any other living man, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.


31 You, O king, were looking, and saw a great image. This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was terrifying.
32 The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze,
33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.
34 As you looked, a stone was cut out—not by hands—and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay and broke them in pieces.
35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were all broken in pieces and became like chaff of the summer threshing floors, and the wind carried them away so that no trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.


36 This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation.


37 You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory—
38 and wherever the sons of man dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens He has given into your hand and made you ruler over them all—you are the head of gold.
39 After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you, and another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.
40 Then there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, for iron crushes and shatters everything. Like iron that breaks all these, it shall crush and break in pieces.
41 As you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with clay.
42 And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle.
43 As you saw the iron mixed with clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay.


44 In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. It shall crush all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever.
45 Just as you saw that a stone was cut out from the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, so the great God has made known to the king what shall be after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.”


46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and paid homage to Daniel and commanded that an offering and incense be presented to him.
47 The king answered and said to Daniel, “Truly your God is God of gods and Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery.”
48 Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
49 Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the administration of the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king’s court.




Chapter 3


1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, its height sixty cubits and its width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king called the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come for a gathering at the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had built.
3 Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had built, and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had built.


4 Then the herald cried aloud, “To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and tongues,
5 that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you shall fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.
6 And whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.”
7 Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and tongues fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.


8 At that time certain Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews.
9 They spoke and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, “O king, live forever!
10 You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music shall fall down and worship the golden image,
11 and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
12 There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—these men, O king, do not pay attention to you. They do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.”


13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. So they brought these men before the king.
14 Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up?
15 Now if you are ready, at the time you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image which I have made, then it will be well with you. But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands?”


16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.
17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
18 But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have built.”


19 Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the expression of his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace to be heated seven times more than it was usually heated.
20 He commanded the mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
21 Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
22 Because the king’s command was urgent and the furnace was exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.


24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste. He said to his counselors, “Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?” They answered and said to the king, “That is True, O king.”
25 He answered and said, “Look! I see four men unbound, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are unharmed, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.”


26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace. He declared, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out and come here!” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the middle of the fire.
27 And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king’s counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had no power over the bodies of these men. The hair of their heads was not singed, their cloaks were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come upon them.


28 Nebuchadnezzar declared, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him and set aside the king’s command and yielded their bodies rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
29 Therefore I make a decree that any man of any people, nation, or tongue who speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb and his house laid in ruins, for there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.”
30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.




Chapter 4


1 Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.
2 It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked for me.
3 How great are His signs, and how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion endures from generation to generation.


4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace.
5 I saw a dream that made me afraid. The thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head disturbed me.
6 So I issued a decree to bring in before me all the wise men of Babylon, so that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
7 So the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and diviners came in, and I told the dream to them, but they could not interpret it for me.
8 But at last Daniel came in before me—he who is named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods—and I told the dream to him:


9 “O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you. Tell me the visions of my dream that I saw, and its interpretation.
10 These were the visions of my head as I lay on my bed: I looked and saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.
11 The tree grew and became strong. Its height reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of all the earth.
12 Its foliage was beautiful, its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, the birds of the heavens lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.


13 I saw in the visions of my head as I lay on my bed, and there was a watcher, a holy one who came down from heaven.
14 He called out with a loud voice and said, ‘Chop down the tree and cut off its branches, strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.
15 But leave the stump with its roots in the ground, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.
16 Let his mind be changed from a man’s, and let a beast’s mind be given to him, and let seven times pass over him.
17 The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the decision by the word of the holy ones, so that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of man, and gives it to whom He will, and sets over it the lowliest of men.’


18 I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen this dream. And you, Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make the interpretation known to me, but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”


19 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was dismayed for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke and said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or the interpretation trouble you.” Belteshazzar answered and said, “My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you, and its interpretation for your enemies.
20 The tree that you saw, which grew and became strong, whose height reached to heaven and was visible to all the earth,
21 whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which the beasts of the field lived and in whose branches the birds of the heavens dwelt—
22 it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth.


23 And as the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump with its roots in the ground, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field until seven times pass over him’—
24 this is the interpretation, O king, and it is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:
25 You shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like cattle, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven. Seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of man and gives it to whom He will.
26 And as it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be assured to you after you come to know that Heaven rules.
27 Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you: break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed—perhaps there may be a lengthening of your prosperity.”


28 All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.
29 At the end of twelve months, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,
30 the king said, “Isn't this the great city of Babylon, which I have built by the might of my power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?”
31 While the word was still in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven: “O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: The kingdom has departed from you.
32 You shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like cattle, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of man and gives it to whom He will.”
33 Immediately the word was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from among men, ate grass like cattle, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like eagle’s feathers and his nails like bird’s claws.


34 But at the end of the appointed days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me. I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him who lives forever, for His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom endures from generation to generation.
35 All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and He does according to His will among the hosts of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth. None can restrain His hand or say to Him, “What have You done?”


36 At the same time, my reason returned to me, and the glory of my kingdom, my majesty, and my splendor returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me out, and I was reestablished in my kingdom, and surpassing greatness was added to me.
37 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the King of heaven, for all His works are right and His ways are just. And those who walk in pride He is able to humble.




Chapter 5


1 Belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords and drank wine in front of the thousand.
2 While under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar gave orders to bring in the gold and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple that was in Jerusalem, so that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink from them.
3 Then they brought in the gold vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God that was in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.
4 They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.


5 Suddenly the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and wrote opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace, and the king saw the hand as it wrote.
6 Then the king’s face changed, and his thoughts alarmed him; the joints of his hips gave way, and his knees knocked together.
7 The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king declared to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and shows me its interpretation shall be clothed in purple, have a chain of gold around his neck, and be the third ruler in the kingdom.”
8 Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or make known its interpretation to the king.
9 Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, and his face grew even paler, and his lords were perplexed.


10 The queen, because of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet hall. The queen declared, “O king, live forever! Let not your thoughts alarm you or your face be changed.
11 There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him, and King Nebuchadnezzar your father—your father the king—made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers.
12 Because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, let Daniel now be called, and he will show the interpretation.”


13 Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah?
14 I have heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you.
15 Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could not show the interpretation of the matter.
16 But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed in purple, have a chain of gold around your neck, and be the third ruler in the kingdom.”


17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Keep your gifts to yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation.
18 O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship, greatness, glory, and majesty.
19 And because of the greatness that He gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he wished he killed, and whom he wished he kept alive; whom he wished he raised up, and whom he wished he humbled.
20 But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him.
21 He was driven from among the sons of man, and his mind was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the Most High God rules the kingdom of man and sets over it whom He will.
22 Yet you, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,
23 but you have lifted yourself up against the Lord of heaven. The vessels of His house have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them. And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know, but the God in whose hand is your breath and all your ways, you have not honored.


24 Then from His presence the hand was sent, and this writing was inscribed.
25 And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN.
26 This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE—God has numbered your kingdom and brought it to an end;
27 TEKEL—you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting;
28 PERES—your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”


29 Then Belshazzar gave the command, and they clothed Daniel in purple, put a chain of gold around his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
30 That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was killed.
31 And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.




Chapter 6


1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom,
2 and over them three high officials, of whom Daniel was one, so that these satraps might give account to them, and the king might not suffer loss.
3 Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the high officials and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. The king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.


4 Then the high officials and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him.
5 Then these men said, “We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”


6 Then these high officials and satraps conspired together and came to the king and said thus to him: “O King Darius, live forever!
7 All the high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an interdict, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.
8 Now, O king, establish the law and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked.”
9 Therefore King Darius signed the document and law.


10 When Daniel found out that the document had been signed, he went to his house. In his upper chamber, with its windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously.
11 Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel praying and pleading before his God.
12 Then they approached and spoke before the king concerning the interdict: “Did you not sign an interdict, that anyone who prays to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?” The king answered and said, “The matter stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked.”
13 Then they answered and said before the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or the law you have signed, but makes his prayers three times a day.”


14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed and set his heart on delivering Daniel. He labored until the sun went down to rescue him.
15 Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no law or statute that the king establishes can be changed.”
16 Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you.”
17 And a stone was brought and laid over the entrance of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, so that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
18 Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting. No entertainment was brought before him, and sleep fled from him.


19 Then, at break of day, the king arose and hastened to the den of lions.
20 As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king said to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”
21 Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever!
22 My God sent his angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.”
23 Then the king was exceedingly glad and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.


24 Then the king commanded, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions—they, their children, and their wives. And before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.


25 Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: “Peace be multiplied to you.
26 I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion men are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, enduring forever; his kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion shall be to the end.
27 He delivers and rescues; he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions.”


28 So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.




Chapter 7


1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head while on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and recounted the matter.
2 Daniel said, “I looked in my vision by night, and saw the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea.
3 And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.


4 The first was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle. I looked until its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.


5 And I saw another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And they said thus to it, ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’


6 After this I looked, and I saw another, like a leopard, which had four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it.


7 After this I looked in the night visions, and saw a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and trampled what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.
8 As I was considering the horns, I saw there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were uprooted. And I saw in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things.


9 I watched until thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure wool; His throne was flames of fire, and its wheels a burning fire.
10 A river of fire flowed and came out from before Him. A thousand thousands served Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.


11 I watched then because of the sound of the great words which the horn was speaking. I watched until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and given to be burned with fire.
12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.


13 I looked in the night visions, and saw that with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man. He came to the Ancient of Days and was brought near before Him.
14 And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and tongues should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.


15 As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me, and the visions of my head troubled me.
16 I approached one of those who stood nearby and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he spoke to me and revealed to me the interpretation of the things:
17 ‘These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth.
18 But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.’


19 Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, which devoured, broke in pieces, and trampled what was left with its feet,
20 and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other one that came up, before which three fell—the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and seemed greater than its companions.
21 I looked, and this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them
22 until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom.


23 This is what he said: ‘The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall trample it down and break it in pieces.
24 As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them. He shall be different from the former ones and shall subdue three kings.
25 He shall speak words against the Most High and shall cause trouble for the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change times and law, and they shall be given into his hand for a time, and times, and half a time.
26 But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed completely.
27 And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High. Their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.’


28 Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubled me, and my countenance changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.




Chapter 8


1 In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me previously.
2 I saw in the vision—and as I looked, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam—and in the vision I saw myself beside the Ulai canal.
3 Then I lifted my eyes and looked, and there before me was a ram standing beside the canal. It had two horns, and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.
4 I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No beast could stand before it, and there was no one who could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great.
5 As I was considering this, suddenly a male goat came from the west, crossing the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between its eyes.
6 It came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing beside the canal, and ran at it in the fury of its strength.
7 I saw it reach the ram, and it was enraged against it. It struck the ram and broke its two horns. The ram had no strength to stand before it. So it threw it down to the ground and trampled it, and there was no one to rescue the ram from its power.
8 Then the male goat grew exceedingly great. But when it became strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place four conspicuous horns came up toward the four winds of heaven.
9 Out of one of them came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land.
10 It grew as high as the host of heaven. It cast down to the earth some of the host and some of the stars and trampled them.
11 It even exalted itself as high as the prince of the host, and from him the regular burnt offering was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown.
12 Because of transgression, an army was given over to the horn along with the regular burnt offering, and it cast truth to the ground and acted and succeeded.


13 Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, “For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, the transgression that desolates, the giving over of the sanctuary and the host to be trampled?”
14 And he said to me, “For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.”


15 When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. Then suddenly one who had the appearance of a man stood before me.
16 And I heard a human voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called out and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”
17 So he came near to where I stood, and when he came, I was terrified and fell on my face. But he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision pertains to the time of the end.”
18 As he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand upright.
19 He said, “Watch and I will make known to you what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation, for it pertains to the appointed time of the end.


20 As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia.
21 And the male goat is the king of Greece. The great horn between its eyes is the first king.
22 As for the horn that was broken, in whose place four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power.
23 In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their full measure, a king of fierce countenance and skilled in intrigue shall arise.
24 His power shall be mighty—but not by his own power—and he shall destroy marvelously. He shall succeed and do as he pleases. He shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
25 By his cunning he shall cause deceit to prosper under his hand. In his own mind he shall become great. Without warning he shall destroy many. He shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, but he shall be broken—yet not by human hand.
26 The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been told is true, but seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now.”
27 Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Afterward I rose and went about the king’s business. But I was appalled by the vision, and there was no one to explain it.




Chapter 9


1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans—
2 in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the books the number of the years which came as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolations of Jerusalem would last seventy years.
3 So I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking Him by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
4 I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed, saying, “O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love Him and keep His commandments,
5 we have sinned and committed iniquity, we have acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from Your commandments and Your ordinances.
6 We have not listened to Your servants, the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our princes, our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
7 To You, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us open shame—as on this day—to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, those who are near and those who are far away in all the lands to which You have driven them, because of their unfaithfulness which they committed against You.
8 O LORD, to us belongs open shame—to our kings, our princes, and our fathers—because we have sinned against You.
9 To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him.
10 We have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in His laws, which He set before us by His servants the prophets.
11 Indeed, all Israel has transgressed Your law and turned aside, refusing to obey Your voice. So the curse and the oath written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out upon us, because we have sinned against Him.
12 He has confirmed His words, which He spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us, by bringing upon us a great calamity. For under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what was done to Jerusalem.
13 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this calamity has come upon us; yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our iniquities and gaining insight by Your truth.
14 Therefore the LORD has kept ready the calamity and has brought it upon us, for the LORD our God is righteous in all His deeds which He has done, but we have not obeyed His voice.
15 And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and made a name for Yourself, as it is this day—we have sinned, we have acted wickedly.
16 O Lord, in keeping with all Your righteous acts, let Your anger and Your wrath turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain. Because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach to all who are around us.
17 So now, our God, listen to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplications, and for Your own sake, O Lord, cause Your face to shine upon Your desolate sanctuary.
18 Incline Your ear, my God, and hear. Open Your eyes and see our desolations, and the city that is called by Your name. For we do not present our supplications before You because of our righteousness, but because of Your great mercy.
19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, pay attention and act. Do not delay—for Your own sake, my God—because Your city and Your people are called by Your name.”


20 While I was still speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God—
21 while I was still speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening offering.
22 He instructed me and spoke with me and said, “O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you insight and understanding.
23 At the beginning of your supplications a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly beloved. So consider the word and understand the vision.
24 Seventy weeks are decreed concerning your people and your holy city, to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy one.
25 Know, therefore, and understand: from the going forth of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem, until the coming of Messiah, the prince, there shall be seven weeks, and for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again, with plaza and moat, but in troubled times.
26 And after the sixty-two weeks, Messiah shall be cut off and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war—desolations are decreed.


27 And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week. But in the middle of the week he shall cause sacrifice and offerings to cease. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out upon the desolator.”




Chapter 10


1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar. The message was true, and it concerned a great conflict. He understood the message and had understanding of the vision.
2 In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three full weeks.
3 I ate no rich food, no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I did not anoint myself at all until the three weeks were completed.


4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, that is, the Tigris,
5 I lifted up my eyes and looked, and I saw a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.
6 His body was like beryl, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.


7 I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision. Yet a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
8 So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me. My face grew deathly pale, and I had no strength.
9 Then I heard the sound of his words, and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground.
10 Then, it happened that a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
11 And he said to me, “O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for now I have been sent to you.” And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling.
12 Then he said to me, “Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words.


13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me for twenty-one days. Then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia.
14 Now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to days yet to come.”
15 When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face to the ground and was speechless.
16 And behold, one in the likeness of the sons of man touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, “My lord, by reason of the vision, sorrows have overwhelmed me, and I have retained no strength.
17 How can my lord’s servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me.”


18 Then again the one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me.
19 And he said, “Do not be afraid, O man greatly beloved. Peace be to you; be strong and of good courage.” And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”
20 Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? But now I must return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I go out, you will see the prince of Greece come.
21 But I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. There is none who contends with me against these except Michael your prince.”




Chapter 11


1 And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.
2 And now I will show you the truth: Three more kings shall arise in Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than all of them. And when he has become strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece.
3 Then a mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion and do as he pleases.
4 But as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom shall be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his descendants, nor with the authority with which he ruled. For his kingdom shall be uprooted and given to others besides them.
5 Then the king of the south shall grow strong, but one of his commanders shall grow stronger than he and rule; his dominion shall be a great dominion indeed.
6 After some years they shall make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement. But she shall not retain the power of her arm, and neither he nor his arm shall stand. But she shall be given up, along with those who brought her in, and he who fathered her, and he who supported her in those times.
7 But from a branch of her roots one shall arise in his place, and he shall come against the army and enter the fortress of the king of the north; he shall act against them and prevail.
8 He shall also carry off to Egypt their gods with their molten images and their precious vessels of silver and gold, and for some years he shall refrain from attacking the king of the north.
9 Then the latter shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but shall return to his own land.
10 His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of great forces, and one of them shall come and overflow and pass through. Then he shall return and wage war up to his fortress.
11 Then the king of the south shall be enraged and go out and fight with the king of the north. And the latter shall raise a great multitude, but it shall be given into the hand of the former.
12 When the multitude is taken away, his heart shall be exalted, and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.
13 For the king of the north shall again raise a multitude, greater than the former, and after some years he shall come on with a great army and abundant supplies.
14 In those times many shall rise against the king of the south, and the violent ones among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they shall stumble.
15 Then the king of the north shall come and cast up siegeworks and take a well-fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, nor even his choicest troops, for there shall be no strength to stand.
16 But he who comes against him shall do as he pleases, and no one shall stand before him. And he shall stand in the glorious land, with destruction in his hand.
17 He shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and he shall bring terms of peace and give him the daughter of women to destroy the kingdom. But it shall not succeed or be to his advantage.
18 Afterward he shall turn his face to the coastlands and shall capture many. But a commander shall put an end to his insolence; indeed, he shall turn his insolence back upon him.
19 Then he shall turn his face back toward the fortresses of his own land, but he shall stumble and fall and shall not be found.
20 Then one shall arise in his place who shall send an exactor of tribute through the glory of the kingdom. But within a few days he shall be broken, though not in anger or in battle.
21 In his place shall arise a contemptible man, to whom royal majesty has not been given. He shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom by intrigue.
22 Armies shall be utterly swept away before him and broken, even the prince of the covenant.
23 And from the time that an alliance is made with him, he shall act deceitfully, and he shall rise and become strong with a small people.
24 Without warning he shall come into the richest parts of the province, and he shall do what neither his fathers nor his fathers’ fathers have done, scattering among them plunder, spoil, and goods. He shall devise plans against strongholds, but only for a time.
25 He shall stir up his strength and his heart against the king of the south with a great army, and the king of the south shall wage war with a very great and mighty army. But he shall not stand, for plots shall be devised against him.
26 Those who eat his rich food shall destroy him, and his army shall be swept away, and many shall fall slain.
27 And as for the two kings, their hearts shall be bent on evil. They shall speak lies at the same table, but it shall not succeed, for the end is still to be at the appointed time.
28 Then he shall return to his land with great wealth, but his heart shall be set against the holy covenant. He shall act and return to his own land.
29 At the appointed time he shall return and come into the south, but it shall not be as it was before.
30 For ships from Kittim shall come against him, and he shall be disheartened and return, and he shall rage against the holy covenant and act. He shall return and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant.
31 Forces from him shall arise and profane the temple and the fortress. They shall take away the regular burnt offering, and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate.
32 He shall corrupt with flattery those who act wickedly against the covenant, but the people who know their God shall be strong and take action.
33 The wise among the people shall give understanding to many, though they shall fall by sword and flame, by captivity and plunder, for many days.
34 When they stumble, they shall receive a little help, and many shall join them in hypocrisy.
35 Some of the wise shall stumble, so that they may be refined, purified, and made white, until the time of the end, for it still awaits the appointed time.
36 And the king shall do as he pleases. He shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak astonishing things against the God of gods. He shall prosper until the indignation is accomplished, for what is decreed shall be done.
37 He shall pay no regard to the gods of his fathers or to the one beloved by women. He shall not pay regard to any god, for he shall magnify himself above all.
38 But in their place he shall honor the god of fortresses—a god whom his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.
39 He shall deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god. He shall greatly honor those who acknowledge him, and shall make them rulers over many and shall divide the land for a price.
40 At the time of the end the king of the south shall clash with him, but the king of the north shall storm against him with chariots and horsemen and many ships. He shall enter countries and overflow and pass through.
41 He shall enter the glorious land, and tens of thousands shall fall. But these shall escape from his hand: Edom and Moab and the chief of the sons of Ammon.
42 He shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
43 He shall gain control over the treasures of gold and silver and all the precious things of Egypt, and the Libyans and Cushites shall follow at his heels.
44 But news from the east and the north shall alarm him, and he shall go out with great fury to destroy and to devote many to destruction.
45 And he shall pitch his palatial tents between the sea and the glorious holy mountain. Yet he shall come to his end, with no one to help him.




Chapter 12


1 At that time Michael shall arise, the great prince who stands over the sons of your people, and there shall be a time of trouble such as has never occurred since there was a nation until that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone who is found written in the book.
2 And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
3 And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament, and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.
4 But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.


5 Then I, Daniel, looked, and saw: two others stood, one on this bank of the river and one on that bank of the river.
6 And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long shall it be until the end of these wonders?”
7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river. He raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and swore by Him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end, all these things will be finished.
8 I heard, but I did not understand. So I said, “My lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?”


9 And he said, “Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end.
10 Many shall be purified and made white and refined, but the wicked shall act wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.
11 And from the time that the regular burnt offering is taken away and the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days.
12 Blessed is he who waits and reaches the one thousand three hundred thirty-five days.
13 But as for you, go your way to the end. Then you shall rest and shall stand in your allotted place at the end of days.”﻿Hosea


Chapter 1


1 The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel.


2 When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a wife of prostitution and children of prostitution, for the land commits great prostitution by forsaking the LORD.”
3 So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.


4 Then the LORD said to him, “Name him Jezreel, for in a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
5 On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”


6 Then she conceived again and bore a daughter. And He said to him, “Name her Lo-Ruhamah, for I will no longer show mercy to the house of Israel, that I should ever forgive them.
7 But I will show mercy to the house of Judah, and I will save them by the LORD their God. I will not save them by bow or by sword or by war, by horses or horsemen.”


8 After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.
9 And He said, “Name him Lo-Ammi, for you are not My people, and I am not your God.”
10 Yet the number of the sons of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted. And in the place where it was said to them, “You are not My people,” it shall be said to them, “Sons of the living God.”
11 And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint for themselves one head. And they shall go up from the land, for great is the day of Jezreel.




Chapter 2


1 Say to your brothers, “Ammi,” and to your sisters, “Ruhamah.”
2 Contend with your mother, contend— for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband— so let her remove her prostitution from her face and her adultery from between her breasts,
3 lest I strip her naked and expose her as on the day of her birth. I will make her like a wilderness and render her like a parched land, and let her die of thirst.


4 And I will not have compassion on her children, for they are children of prostitution.
5 For their mother has played the whore; she who conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, “I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.”


6 Therefore, look how I will hedge up her path with thorns, and I will build a wall against her so that she cannot find her paths.
7 She will pursue her lovers but will not overtake them; she will seek them but not find them. Then she will say, “I will go and return to my first husband, for it was better for me then than now.”
8 But she did not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil, and who lavished on her silver and gold— which they used for Baal.


9 Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my new wine in its season, and I will remove my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.
10 Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and no one will rescue her out of my hand.
11 And I will put an end to all her joy, her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths— all her appointed times.
12 And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, of which she said, “These are my wages which my lovers have given me.” I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall devour them.
13 I will punish her for the days of the Baals, to whom she burned incense. She adorned herself with earrings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but Me she forgot—declares the LORD.


14 Therefore, see how I will allure her and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.
15 And there I will give her vineyards, and the Valley of Achor as a door of hope. And she shall respond there as in the days of her youth, as in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt.
16 In that day—declares the LORD—you will call Me “My Husband,” and no longer will you call Me “My Baal.”
17 For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall be remembered by name no more.
18 And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky and the creeping things of the ground. And I will abolish the bow and the sword and war from the land, and I will make them lie down in safety.
19 And I will betroth you to Me forever; I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice, in covenant loyalty and in compassion.
20 I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness, and you shall know the LORD.


21 On that day, I will answer—declares the LORD— I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth,
22 and the earth shall answer the grain and the new wine and the oil, and they shall answer Jezreel.
23 I will sow her for Myself in the land, and I will have compassion on Lo-Ruhamah, and I will say to Lo-Ammi, “You are My people.” And he will say, “You are my God.”




Chapter 3


1 Then the LORD said to me, “Go again, love a woman who is loved by another and is an adulteress, just as the LORD loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.”
2 So I bought her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a lethech of barley.
3 And I said to her, “You must dwell with me for many days. You shall not play the whore, and you shall not belong to another man, and I also will be faithful to you.”
4 For the sons of Israel shall dwell many days without king and without prince, without sacrifice and without pillar, and without ephod and teraphim.
5 Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king, and they will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the latter days.




Chapter 4


1 Hear the word of the LORD, O sons of Israel,
for the LORD has a dispute with the inhabitants of the land:
there is no truth, no covenant loyalty,
and no knowledge of God in the land.
2 There is swearing and lying,
murder and stealing and adultery;
they break all bounds,
and bloodshed follows bloodshed.
3 Therefore the land mourns,
and all who dwell in it languish,
along with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens;
even the fish of the sea are taken away.


4 Yet let no man contend,
and let no man rebuke,
for your people are like those who contend with a priest.
5 You shall stumble by day,
and the prophet also shall stumble with you by night;
and I will destroy your mother.
6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge;
because you have rejected knowledge,
I reject you from being a priest to Me.
And since you have forgotten the law of your God,
I also will forget your children.
7 The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me;
I will change their glory into shame.
8 They feed on the sin of My people;
they are greedy for their iniquity.


9 And it shall be like people, like priest:
I will punish them for their ways
and repay them for their deeds.
10 They shall eat but not be satisfied;
they shall play the whore but not multiply,
because they have forsaken the LORD
to cherish whoredom,
11 wine, and new wine,
which take away understanding.


12 My people inquire of a piece of wood,
and their staff gives them oracles.
For a spirit of whoredom has led them astray,
and they have played the whore, departing from their God.
13 They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains
and burn offerings on the hills,
under oak, poplar, and terebinth,
because their shade is good.
Therefore your daughters play the whore,
and your brides commit adultery.
14 I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore,
nor your brides when they commit adultery;
for the men themselves go aside with whores
and sacrifice with cult prostitutes,
and a people without understanding shall be thrown down.


15 Though you play the whore, O Israel,
let not Judah become guilty.
Do not go to Gilgal,
do not go up to Beth-aven,
and do not swear, “As the LORD lives.”
16 Like a stubborn heifer,
Israel is stubborn;
can the LORD now pasture them
like a lamb in a broad pasture?
17 Ephraim is joined to idols;
leave him alone.
18 When their drinking is done,
they give themselves to whoring;
their rulers dearly love shame.
19 A wind has wrapped them in its wings,
and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.




Chapter 5


1 Hear this, O priests!
Give heed, O house of Israel!
Listen, O house of the king!
For the judgment is for you,
because you have been a snare at Mizpah
and a net spread over Tabor.
2 The revolters have gone deep into slaughter,
but I will discipline them all.
3 I know Ephraim,
and Israel is not hidden from Me;
for now, O Ephraim, you have played the whore;
Israel is defiled.
4 Their deeds do not allow them to return to their God,
for a spirit of whoredom is within them,
and they do not know the LORD.


5 The pride of Israel testifies against him;
Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their guilt;
Judah also shall stumble with them.
6 With their flocks and herds they shall go
to seek the LORD,
but they will not find Him;
He has withdrawn from them.
7 They have dealt treacherously with the LORD,
for they have borne illegitimate children;
now the new moon shall devour them
with their fields.


8 Blow the horn in Gibeah,
the trumpet in Ramah.
Sound the alarm at Beth-aven:
behind you, Benjamin!
9 Ephraim shall become a desolation
in the day of punishment;
among the tribes of Israel
I make known what is sure.


10 The princes of Judah have become
like those who move the landmark;
upon them I will pour out
My wrath like water.
11 Ephraim is oppressed,
crushed by judgment,
because he was determined
to walk after filth.
12 But I am like a moth to Ephraim,
and like rottenness to the house of Judah.
13 When Ephraim saw his sickness,
and Judah his wound,
then Ephraim went to Assyria,
and sent to the great king,
but he is not able to heal you
or cure your wound.
14 For I will be like a lion to Ephraim,
and like a young lion to the house of Judah.
I, even I, will tear and go away;
I will carry off, and no one shall rescue.
15 I will return again to My place,
until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face,
and in their distress earnestly seek Me.




Chapter 6


1 Come, let us return to the LORD,
for He has torn us, but He will heal us;
He has struck us down, but He will bind us up.
2 After two days He will revive us;
on the third day He will raise us up,
that we may live before Him.
3 Let us know—yes, let us pursue knowledge of the LORD.
His coming forth is as sure as the dawn.
He will come to us like the rain,
like the latter rain that waters the earth.


4 What shall I do with you, O Ephraim?
What shall I do with you, O Judah?
Your loyalty is like the morning cloud,
like the dew that goes early away.
5 Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets,
I have slain them by the words of My mouth,
and My judgment goes forth like the light.


6 For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice,
and the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
7 But like Adam they transgressed the covenant;
there they dealt faithlessly with Me.


8 Gilead is a city of evildoers,
tracked with blood.
9 As bands of robbers lie in wait for a man,
so the company of priests murder on the way to Shechem;
yes, they commit wickedness.
10 In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing:
there Ephraim plays the whore,
Israel is defiled.
11 For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed,
when I restore the fortunes of My people.




Chapter 7


1 When I would heal Israel,
then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,
and the wickedness of Samaria;
for they commit falsehood,
and the thief breaks in,
and the band of robbers raids outside.
2 But they do not consider in their hearts
that I remember all their evil.
Now their deeds surround them;
they are before My face.
3 By their wickedness they make the king glad,
and the princes by their lies.
4 They are all adulterers;
they are like an oven heated by the baker,
who ceases stirring from kneading the dough
until it is leavened.


5 On the day of our king, the princes
become sick with the heat of wine;
he stretches out his hand with scorners.
6 For they prepare their hearts like an oven,
while they lie in wait.
Their anger smolders all night;
in the morning it burns like a flaming fire.
7 They are all hot as an oven,
and they devour their judges.
All their kings have fallen;
none among them calls to Me.


8 Ephraim mixes himself with the peoples;
Ephraim is a cake not turned.
9 Strangers devour his strength,
yet he does not know it.
Even gray hairs are sprinkled on him,
yet he does not know.
10 The pride of Israel testifies against him,
yet they do not return to the LORD their God,
nor seek Him for all this.
11 Ephraim is like a dove, silly and without sense;
they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
12 As they go, I will spread My net over them;
I will bring them down like the birds of the heavens;
I will chastise them according to what was heard in their assembly.
13 Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me!
Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against Me!
Though I would redeem them,
they speak lies against Me.
14 They do not cry to Me from the heart,
but they wail upon their beds.
For grain and wine they gather themselves,
they rebel against Me.
15 Though I trained and strengthened their arms,
yet they devise evil against Me.
16 They return, but not upward;
they are like a treacherous bow.
Their princes shall fall by the sword
for the rage of their tongue.
This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.




Chapter 8


1 Set the trumpet to your lips!
Like an eagle over the house of the LORD,
because they have transgressed My covenant
and rebelled against My law.
2 They cry to Me, “My God, we—Israel—know You!”
3 Israel has rejected the good;
the enemy shall pursue him.
4 They set up kings, but not by Me;
they appoint princes, but I did not acknowledge them.
With their silver and gold they make idols for themselves,
that they might be cut off.
5 Your calf, O Samaria, has cast you off.
My anger burns against them.
How long will they be incapable of innocence?
6 For it is from Israel;
a craftsman made it,
it is not God.
Surely the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.


7 For they sow the wind,
and they shall reap the whirlwind.
The stalk has no head,
it shall yield no grain.
If it were to yield,
strangers would devour it.
8 Israel is swallowed up;
now they are among the nations
like a worthless vessel.
9 For they have gone up to Assyria,
a wild donkey wandering alone;
Ephraim has hired lovers.
10 Even though they hire among the nations,
I will now gather them,
and they shall begin to diminish
because of the burden of king and princes.


11 Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin,
they have become to him altars for sinning.
12 Though I wrote for him myriads of My laws,
they are regarded as a strange thing.
13 As for My sacrificial offerings,
they sacrifice meat and eat it,
but the LORD does not accept them.
Now He will remember their iniquity
and punish their sins;
they shall return to Egypt.
14 For Israel has forgotten his Maker
and built palaces,
and Judah has multiplied fortified cities.
But I will send fire upon his cities,
and it shall consume her fortresses.




Chapter 9


1 Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation like the nations,
for you have played the whore, forsaking your God.
You have loved a prostitute's wages on every threshing floor.
2 Threshing floor and winepress shall not feed them,
and the new wine shall fail them.
3 They shall not remain in the land of the LORD,
but Ephraim shall return to Egypt,
and in Assyria they shall eat unclean food.
4 They shall not pour out wine offerings to the LORD,
and their sacrifices shall not please Him.
They shall be to them like mourners’ bread;
all who eat of it shall be defiled.
For their bread is for their hunger only;
it shall not come to the house of the LORD.


5 What will you do on the day of the appointed festival,
and on the day of the feast of the LORD?
6 For behold, they are gone because of destruction;
Egypt shall gather them,
Memphis shall bury them.
Nettles shall possess their treasures of silver;
thorns shall be in their tents.
7 The days of punishment have come;
the days of recompense have arrived.
Let Israel know it!
The prophet is a fool,
the man of the spirit is mad,
because of the greatness of your iniquity
and great hostility.
8 Ephraim is a watchman with my God—
a prophet!—
a fowler’s snare is on all his paths,
and enmity is in the house of his God.
9 They have deeply corrupted themselves
as in the days of Gibeah.
He will remember their iniquity;
He will punish their sins.
10 Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel.
Like the first fruit on the fig tree in its first season I saw your fathers.
But they came to Baal-peor,
and consecrated themselves to shame,
and became detestable like the thing they loved.


11 Ephraim’s glory shall fly away like a bird—
no birth, no pregnancy, no conception!
12 Even if they bring up children,
I will bereave them till none is left.
Woe to them
when I depart from them!
13 Ephraim, as I have seen, was like Tyre,
planted in a meadow;
but Ephraim must lead out his children to slaughter.


14 Give them, O LORD—what will You give?
Give them a miscarrying womb
and dry breasts.
15 Every evil of theirs is in Gilgal;
there I began to hate them.
Because of the wickedness of their deeds
I will drive them out of My house.
I will love them no more;
all their princes are rebels.
16 Ephraim is stricken;
their root is dried up;
they shall bear no fruit.
Even though they give birth,
I will put to death the beloved ones of their womb.
17 My God will reject them
because they have not listened to Him;
they shall be wanderers among the nations.




Chapter 10


1 Israel is a luxuriant vine,
he yields fruit for himself.
The more his fruit increased,
the more he increased the altars.
The better his land,
the better they made the sacred pillars.
2 Their heart is false;
now they must bear their guilt.
The LORD will break down their altars
and destroy their sacred pillars.
3 For now they will say,
“We have no king,
for we did not fear the LORD.
And a king—what could he do for us?”
4 They speak empty words,
swearing falsely, making covenants;
so judgment springs up like hemlock
in the furrows of the field.


5 The inhabitants of Samaria tremble
for the calf of Beth-aven.
Indeed, its people will mourn over it,
and its idolatrous priests—
those who rejoiced over it—
for its glory has departed from it.
6 It shall also be carried to Assyria
as tribute to the great king.
Ephraim shall receive shame,
and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
7 Samaria is destroyed;
her king is like a twig
on the face of the waters.
8 The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel,
shall be destroyed.
Thorn and thistle shall grow on their altars.
And they shall say to the mountains, “Cover us,”
and to the hills, “Fall on us.”


9 From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel;
there they have continued.
Shall not war overtake them
in Gibeah for the sons of iniquity?
10 When I please, I will discipline them,
and nations shall be gathered against them
when they are bound for their double guilt.
11 Ephraim was a trained heifer
that loved to thresh,
and I spared her fair neck.
I will make Ephraim to ride;
Judah shall plow,
Jacob shall break his clods.


12 Sow for yourselves righteousness,
reap steadfast love;
break up your fallow ground,
for it is time to seek the LORD,
that He may come and rain righteousness upon you.
13 You have plowed wickedness,
you have reaped injustice,
you have eaten the fruit of lies.
Because you have trusted in your own way
and in the multitude of your warriors,
14 therefore the tumult of war shall arise among your people,
and all your fortresses shall be destroyed,
as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle;
mothers were dashed in pieces with their children.
15 Thus it shall be done to you, O Bethel,
because of your great wickedness.
At dawn the king of Israel
shall be utterly cut off.




Chapter 11


1 When Israel was a child, I loved him,
and out of Egypt I called my son.
2 The more they were called, the more they went away;
they kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols.
3 Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk;
I took them up by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them.
4 I led them with cords of kindness, with bands of love,
and I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws;
I bent down to them and fed them.


5 He shall not return to the land of Egypt,
but Assyria shall be his king,
because they refused to return.
6 The sword shall rage against their cities,
and consume the bars of their gates,
and devour them because of their own counsels.
7 My people are bent on turning away from me.
Though they call to the Most High, none at all will exalt him.


8 How can I give you up, O Ephraim?
How can I hand you over, O Israel?
How can I make you like Admah?
How can I treat you like Zeboiim?
My heart turns within me;
my compassion grows warm and tender.
9 I will not execute the fierceness of my anger;
I will not again destroy Ephraim.
For I am God and not a man,
the Holy One in your midst,
and I will not come in wrath.


10 They shall follow the LORD;
he will roar like a lion;
when he roars,
his sons shall come trembling from the west.
11 They shall come trembling like birds from Egypt,
and like doves from the land of Assyria,
and I will return them to their homes, declares the LORD.


12 Ephraim has surrounded me with lies,
and the house of Israel with deceit;
but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One.




Chapter 12


1 Ephraim feeds on wind and pursues the east wind all day long;
he multiplies lies and violence.
They make a covenant with Assyria,
and oil is carried to Egypt.


2 The LORD has a dispute with Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways;
according to his deeds he will repay him.
3 In the womb he took his brother by the heel,
and in his manhood he strove with God.
4 He strove with the angel and prevailed;
he wept and sought his favor.
At Bethel he found him, and there he spoke with us—
5 the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD is his memorial name.
6 So you, by the help of your God, return,
keep kindness and justice, and wait continually for your God.


7 A merchant in whose hands are false balances, he loves to oppress.
8 Ephraim said, “Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself;
in all my labors they cannot find in me iniquity or sin.”
9 But I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt;
I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed festival.


10 I spoke to the prophets; it was I who multiplied visions,
and through the prophets gave parables.
11 If Gilead is wicked, surely they are worthless.
In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls—indeed,
their altars are like stone heaps in the furrows of the field.
12 Jacob fled to the land of Aram;
Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.
13 By a prophet the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt,
and by a prophet he was guarded.
14 Ephraim has bitterly provoked his Lord;
therefore his Lord will leave his bloodguilt upon him and repay him for his reproach.




Chapter 13


1 When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling;
he was exalted in Israel, but he incurred guilt through Baal and died.
2 And now they sin more and more, and make for themselves molten images,
idols skillfully made from their silver, all of them the work of craftsmen.
They say of them, “Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves!”


3 Therefore they shall be like the morning mist, like the dew that goes early away,
like chaff that swirls from the threshing floor, or like smoke from a window.


4 But I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt;
you know no God but me, and besides me there is no savior.
5 It was I who knew you in the wilderness, in the land of drought.
6 But when they had pasture, they were filled;
they were filled, and their heart was lifted up;
therefore they forgot me.


7 So I will be to them like a lion;
like a leopard I will lurk beside the way.
8 I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs;
I will tear open their breast, and there I will devour them like a lion,
as wild beasts would rip them open.


9 He destroys you, O Israel, for you are against me, against your help.
10 Where now is your king, to save you in all your cities?
Where are all your rulers, of whom you said, “Give me a king and princes”?
11 I gave you a king in my anger, and I took him away in my wrath.


12 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is stored up.
13 The pangs of childbirth come for him, but he is an unwise son,
for at the right time he does not present himself at the opening of the womb.


14 Shall I ransom them from the power of the grave?
Shall I redeem them from death? O Death, where are your plagues?
O grave, where is your sting? Compassion is hidden from my eyes.


15 Though he may flourish among his brothers, the east wind shall come,
the wind of the LORD rising from the wilderness, and his fountain shall dry up,
his spring shall be parched. It shall strip his treasury of every precious thing.
16 Samaria shall bear her guilt, for she has rebelled against her God;
they shall fall by the sword, their infants shall be dashed in pieces,
and their pregnant women ripped open.




Chapter 14


1 Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God,
for you have stumbled by your iniquity.
2 Take with you words and return to the LORD.
Say to him, “Take away all iniquity;
accept what is good, and we will offer the fruit of our lips.
3 Assyria shall not save us;
we will not ride on horses, and we will say no more,
‘Our God,’ to the work of our hands.
For in you the orphan finds mercy.”


4 I will heal their apostasy;
I will love them freely,
for my anger has turned away from him.
5 I will be like the dew to Israel;
he shall blossom like the lily
and take root like the cedars of Lebanon.
6 His shoots shall spread out;
his beauty shall be like the olive tree,
and his fragrance like Lebanon.
7 They shall return and dwell beneath my shadow;
they shall flourish like the grain,
they shall blossom like the vine,
their renown shall be like the wine of Lebanon.


8 Ephraim shall say, “What have I to do with idols?”
It is I who answer and watch over him.
I am like a green cypress tree;
from me comes your fruit.


9 Who is wise, that he may understand these things,
discerning, that he may know them?
For the ways of the LORD are right,
and the righteous walk in them,
but transgressors stumble in them.﻿Joel


Chapter 1


1 The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel:
2 Hear this, O elders, and give ear, all you inhabitants of the land! Has anything like this happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers?
3 Tell your children about it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.
4 What the cutting locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; and what the swarming locust has left, the hopping locust has eaten; and what the hopping locust has left, the destroying locust has eaten.


5 Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you wine drinkers, because of the sweet wine, for it is cut off from your mouth.
6 For a nation has come up against My land, powerful and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it has the fangs of a lioness.
7 It has made My vine a waste and My fig tree a stump. It has stripped them bare and thrown them down; their branches are made white.
8 Lament like a virgin girded in sackcloth for the bridegroom of her youth.


9 The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off from the house of the LORD. The priests mourn, the ministers of the LORD.
10 The field is ruined; the ground mourns, for the grain is destroyed, the new wine has dried up, the oil fails.
11 Be ashamed, O tillers of the soil; wail, O vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley, because the harvest of the field has perished.
12 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree withers; pomegranate, palm, and apple— all the trees of the field are dried up. Surely joy has withered away from the sons of man.


13 Gird yourselves and lament, O priests; wail, O ministers of the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God, for the grain offering and the drink offering are withheld from the house of your God.
14 Consecrate a fast; call a solemn assembly. Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD.
15 Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is near, and as destruction from the Almighty it comes.
16 Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?


17 The seed shrivels under the clods; the storehouses are desolate; the granaries are broken down, because the grain has dried up.
18 How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are confused because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep suffer punishment.
19 To You, O LORD, I cry out, for fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flame has burned all the trees of the field.
20 Even the beasts of the field pant toward You, for the water brooks are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.




Chapter 2


1 Blow the trumpet in Zion; sound an alarm on My holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming—it is near,
2 a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness. Like dawn spread upon the mountains, a great and powerful people—there has never been anything like it, nor will there be again after it for many generations.


3 Before them a fire devours, and behind them a flame burns. The land before them is like the garden of Eden, but behind them a desolate wilderness—and nothing escapes them.
4 Their appearance is like the appearance of horses, and like war horses they run.
5 With a noise like chariots they leap on the tops of mountains, like the crackling of a flame of fire devouring stubble, like a powerful army set in battle array.
6 Before them peoples writhe in anguish; all faces turn pale.
7 Like mighty men they run, like men of war they scale the wall. Each marches on his own way; they do not swerve from their paths.
8 They do not jostle one another; each marches in his path. They burst through the weapons and are not halted.
9 They rush upon the city, they run on the wall, they climb up into the houses, they enter through the windows like a thief.
10 Before them the earth quakes, the heavens tremble. The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars withdraw their shining.


11 The LORD gives voice before His army, for His camp is exceedingly great. He who executes His word is powerful. For the day of the LORD is great and very dreadful—who can endure it?
12 Yet even now, declares the LORD, return to Me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.
13 Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the LORD your God, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and He relents from sending disaster.
14 Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave behind a blessing—grain offering and drink offering for the LORD your God.


15 Blow the trumpet in Zion; consecrate a fast; call a solemn assembly.
16 Gather the people; sanctify the congregation; assemble the elders; gather the children, even nursing infants. Let the bridegroom come out of his chamber and the bride out of her canopy.
17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare Your people, O LORD, and do not make Your heritage a reproach, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the nations, "Where is their God?"


18 Then the LORD became jealous for His land and had pity on His people.
19 And the LORD answered and said to His people, "Look, I am sending you grain, new wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied with them; and I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.
20 I will remove the northerner far from you and drive him into a parched and desolate land, his front into the eastern sea, and his rear into the western sea. His stench will rise, and his foul smell will ascend, for he has done great things."
21 Do not fear, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the LORD has done great things!
22 Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness sprout, for the tree bears its fruit; the fig tree and vine give their full yield.
23 Be glad, O sons of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God, for He has given you the early rain in righteousness. He sends down for you the rain, the early and the latter rain, as before.
24 The threshing floors shall be full of grain, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.
25 And I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten—the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter—My great army that I sent among you.
26 You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And My people shall never again be put to shame.


27 Then you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and there is no other. And My people shall never again be put to shame.
28 And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh. Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
29 Even on the male and female servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.


30 And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth—blood and fire and columns of smoke.
31 The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes.
32 And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved. For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the LORD has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls.




Chapter 3


1 For you will see in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
2 that I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will enter into judgment with them there on behalf of My people and My heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations and have divided up My land.
3 They cast lots for My people; they traded a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine to drink.


4 What are you to Me, O Tyre and Sidon and all the regions of Philistia? Are you repaying Me for something? If you are repaying Me, I will swiftly and speedily return your payment on your own head.
5 For you have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried My precious treasures into your temples.
6 You sold the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the Greeks, to remove them far from their border.
7 Watch as I stir them up from the place to which you sold them, and I will return your payment on your own head.
8 I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off, for the LORD has spoken.


9 Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate yourselves for war; stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.
10 Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, “I am a warrior.”
11 Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, and gather yourselves there. Bring down Your mighty ones, O LORD!
12 Let the nations stir themselves and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. For there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.
13 Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread, for the winepress is full. The vats overflow, for their evil is great.


14 Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
15 The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their brightness.
16 The LORD roars from Zion and utters His voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth quake. But the LORD is a refuge for His people, a stronghold for the sons of Israel.
17 So you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who dwells in Zion, My holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through her.


18 And it will come to pass in that day that the mountains will drip with sweet wine, and the hills will flow with milk, and all the streambeds of Judah will flow with water. And a spring will go out from the house of the LORD and will water the Valley of Shittim.
19 Egypt shall become a desolation, and Edom a desolate wilderness, because of the violence done to the sons of Judah, in whose land they have shed innocent blood.
20 But Judah shall dwell forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
21 I will avenge their blood—blood I have not yet avenged—for the LORD dwells in Zion.﻿Amos


Chapter 1


1 The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds from Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.


2 And he said:
The LORD roars from Zion,
and utters His voice from Jerusalem;
the pastures of the shepherds mourn,
and the top of Carmel dries up.


3 Thus says the LORD:
For three transgressions of Damascus, even for four,
I will not turn back the punishment,
because they threshed Gilead with threshing sledges of iron.
4 So I will send fire upon the house of Hazael,
and it shall devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.
5 I will break the gate bar of Damascus,
and cut off the inhabitant from the Valley of Aven,
and the one who holds the scepter from Beth-eden;
and the people of Aram shall go into exile to Kir,
says the LORD.


6 Thus says the LORD:
For three transgressions of Gaza, even for four,
I will not turn back the punishment,
because they carried away an entire people into exile
to deliver them up to Edom.
7 So I will send fire upon the wall of Gaza,
and it shall devour her strongholds.
8 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod,
and the one who holds the scepter from Ashkelon;
and I will turn my hand against Ekron,
and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish,
says the Lord GOD.


9 Thus says the LORD:
For three transgressions of Tyre, even for four,
I will not turn back the punishment,
because they delivered up an entire people into exile from Edom,
and did not remember the covenant of brothers.
10 So I will send fire upon the wall of Tyre,
and it shall devour her strongholds.


11 Thus says the LORD:
For three transgressions of Edom, even for four,
I will not turn back the punishment,
because he pursued his brother with the sword,
and cast off all compassion,
and his anger tore continually,
and he kept his wrath forever.
12 So I will send fire upon Teman,
and it shall devour the strongholds of Bozrah.


13 Thus says the LORD:
For three transgressions of the Ammonites, even for four,
I will not turn back the punishment,
because they ripped open pregnant women in Gilead
to enlarge their territory.
14 So I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah,
and it shall devour her strongholds,
with shouting on the day of battle,
with a storm on the day of whirlwind.
15 And their king shall go into exile,
he and his princes together,
says the LORD.




Chapter 2


1 Thus says the LORD:
For three transgressions of Moab, even for four,
I will not turn back the punishment,
because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime.
2 So I will send fire upon Moab,
and it shall devour the strongholds of Kerioth,
and Moab shall die amid tumult,
with shouting, with the sound of the trumpet.
3 And I will cut off the ruler from her midst,
and I will slay all her princes with him,
says the LORD.


4 Thus says the LORD:
For three transgressions of Judah, even for four,
I will not turn back the punishment,
because they rejected the law of the LORD,
and have not kept His statutes,
but their lies have led them astray,
after which their fathers walked.
5 So I will send fire upon Judah,
and it shall devour the strongholds of Jerusalem.


6 Thus says the LORD:
For three transgressions of Israel, even for four,
I will not turn back the punishment,
because they sell the righteous for silver,
and the needy for a pair of sandals—
7 those who trample on the head of the poor into the dust of the earth,
and turn aside the way of the afflicted.
A man and his father go in to the same girl,
so that My holy name is profaned.
8 They lie down beside every altar
on garments taken in pledge,
and in the house of their god
they drink the wine of those who have been punished.
9 Yet I destroyed the Amorites before them,
whose height was like the height of the cedars,
and who was strong as the oaks;
I destroyed his fruit above
and his roots beneath.
10 Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,
and led you forty years in the wilderness,
to possess the land of the Amorite.
11 And I raised up some of your sons as prophets,
and some of your young men as Nazirites.
Is this not true, O sons of Israel?
declares the LORD.
12 But you made the Nazirites drink wine,
and commanded the prophets, saying,
“You shall not prophesy.”
13 So then, I will press you down in your place,
as a cart full of sheaves presses down.
14 Flight shall perish from the swift,
and the strong shall not strengthen his power,
nor shall the mighty save his life.
15 He who handles the bow shall not stand,
and the swift of foot shall not escape,
nor shall the horseman save his life.
16 And he who is stout of heart among the mighty
shall flee away naked in that day,
declares the LORD.




Chapter 3


1 Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O sons of Israel,
against the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying:
2 “You only have I known among all the families of the earth;
therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.”


3 Do two walk together,
unless they have agreed to meet?
4 Does a lion roar in the forest,
when he has no prey?
Does a young lion growl from his den,
unless he has caught something?


5 Does a bird fall in a snare on the ground,
when there is no bait for it?
Does a snare spring up from the ground,
when it has taken nothing at all?
6 If a trumpet is blown in a city,
do not the people tremble?
If disaster comes to a city,
has not the LORD allowed it?


7 For the Lord GOD does nothing
without revealing His counsel
to His servants the prophets.
8 The lion has roared; who will not fear?
The Lord GOD has spoken; who can but prophesy?


9 Proclaim it in the citadels of Ashdod
and in the citadels of the land of Egypt, and say,
“Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria,
and see the great tumults within her,
and the oppressions in her midst.”
10 “They do not know how to do what is right,”
declares the LORD,
“those who store up violence and robbery in their citadels.”
11 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD:
"An adversary shall surround the land,
and bring down your strength from you,
and your citadels shall be plundered."


12 Thus says the LORD:
"Just as the shepherd snatches from the mouth of the lion
two legs or a piece of an ear,
so shall the sons of Israel who dwell in Samaria be snatched—
on the corner of a couch and on the damask of a bed."
13 "Hear and testify against the house of Jacob,"
declares the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,
14 "that on the day I punish Israel for his transgressions,
I will also punish the altars of Bethel,
and the horns of the altar shall be cut off
and fall to the ground.
15 I will strike the winter house along with the summer house,
and the houses of ivory shall perish,
and the great houses shall come to an end,"
declares the LORD.




Chapter 4


1 Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the mountain of Samaria,
who oppress the poor, who crush the needy,
who say to their husbands, “Bring, that we may drink!”
2 The Lord GOD has sworn by His holiness,
“Behold, the days are coming upon you
when they shall take you away with hooks,
and your descendants with fishhooks.
3 You shall go out through the breaches, each one straight ahead,
and you shall be cast out toward Harmon,”
declares the LORD.


4 “Come to Bethel, and transgress;
to Gilgal, and multiply transgression;
bring your sacrifices every morning,
your tithes every three days;
5 offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened,
and proclaim freewill offerings, publish them,
for so you love to do, O sons of Israel!”
declares the Lord GOD.


6 “I also gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,
and lack of bread in all your places,
yet you did not return to Me,”
declares the LORD.
7 “And I also withheld the rain from you
when there were still three months to the harvest;
I caused it to rain on one city,
and on another city I did not cause it to rain;
one portion was rained upon,
and the portion where it did not rain withered.
8 So two or three cities wandered to one city to drink water,
but they were not satisfied;
yet you did not return to Me,”
declares the LORD.


9 “I struck you with blight and mildew;
your many gardens and your vineyards,
your fig trees and your olive trees the locust devoured;
yet you did not return to Me,”
declares the LORD.


10 “I sent among you a plague in the manner of Egypt;
I slew your young men with the sword,
along with your captured horses,
and I made the stench of your camps go up into your nostrils;
yet you did not return to Me,”
declares the LORD.


11 “I overthrew some of you,
as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,
and you were like a brand plucked from the burning;
yet you did not return to Me,”
declares the LORD.


12 “Therefore this is what I will do to you, O Israel;
and because I will do this to you,
prepare to meet your God, O Israel!”


13 For see here, He who forms the mountains and creates the wind,
and declares to man what is His thought,
who makes the dawn into darkness,
and treads upon the high places of the earth—
the LORD, the God of hosts, is His name.




Chapter 5


1 Hear this word that I take up as a lamentation over you, O house of Israel:
2 “Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel;
forsaken on her land,
with none to raise her up.”


3 For thus says the Lord GOD:
“The city that went out with a thousand
shall have a hundred left,
and that which went out with a hundred
shall have ten left,
to the house of Israel.”


4 For thus says the LORD to the house of Israel:
“Seek Me and live;
5 but do not seek Bethel,
nor enter into Gilgal,
nor cross over to Beersheba;
for Gilgal shall surely go into exile,
and Bethel shall come to nothing.”


6 Seek the LORD and live,
lest He break out like fire in the house of Joseph,
and it devour, with none to quench it for Bethel,
7 O you who turn justice to wormwood
and cast righteousness down to the earth.


8 He who made the Pleiades and Orion,
and turns deep darkness into morning,
and darkens the day into night,
who calls for the waters of the sea
and pours them out upon the face of the earth—
the LORD is His name—
9 who makes destruction flash out against the strong,
so that destruction comes upon the fortress.


10 They hate him who reproves in the gate,
and they abhor him who speaks with integrity.
11 Therefore, because you trample on the poor
and take from him levies of grain,
you have built houses of hewn stone,
but you shall not dwell in them;
you have planted pleasant vineyards,
but you shall not drink their wine.


12 For I know how many are your transgressions,
and how great are your sins—
you who afflict the righteous,
take a bribe,
and turn aside the needy in the gate.


13 Therefore the prudent will keep silent in such a time,
for it is an evil time.


14 Seek good and not evil, that you may live;
and so the LORD, the God of hosts, will be with you,
as you have said.
15 Hate evil and love good,
and establish justice in the gate;
then it may be that the LORD, the God of hosts,
will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.


16 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord:
“In all the squares there shall be wailing,
and in all the streets they shall say, ‘Woe! Woe!’
They shall call the farmer to mourning,
and to wailing those skilled in lamentation,
17 and in all vineyards there shall be wailing,
for I will pass through your midst,” says the LORD.


18 Woe to you who desire the day of the LORD!
Why would you have the day of the LORD?
It is darkness, and not light;
19 as if a man fled from a lion,
and a bear met him;
or went into the house and leaned his hand against the wall,
and a serpent bit him.
20 Is not the day of the LORD darkness, and not light,
and gloom with no brightness in it?


21 “I hate, and I despise your feasts,
and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
22 Even though you offer Me your burnt offerings and grain offerings,
I will not accept them;
and the peace offerings of your fattened animals,
I will not look upon them.
23 Take away from Me the noise of your songs;
I will not listen to the melody of your harps.


24 But let justice roll down like waters,
and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.


25 Did you bring to Me sacrifices and offerings
during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
26 You shall take up Sikkuth your king,
and Kiyyun your images,
your star-god that you made for yourselves.
27 Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,”
says the LORD, whose name is the God of hosts.




Chapter 6


1 Woe to those who are at ease in Zion,
and to those who feel secure on the mountain of Samaria,
the notable ones of the first of the nations,
to whom the house of Israel comes!
2 Pass over to Calneh and see,
and from there go to Hamath the great;
then go down to Gath of the Philistines.
Are they better than these kingdoms?
Is their territory greater than your territory?
3 You who put far away the day of disaster
and bring near the seat of violence,
4 who lie on beds of ivory
and stretch themselves out on their couches,
and eat lambs from the flock
and calves from the midst of the stall,
5 who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp
and like David invent for themselves instruments of music,
6 who drink wine in bowls
and anoint themselves with the finest oils,
but are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph.
7 Therefore they shall now go into exile at the head of the exiles,
and the revelry of those who stretch themselves out shall pass away.


8 The Lord GOD has sworn by Himself,
declares the LORD, the God of hosts:
“I abhor the pride of Jacob
and hate his strongholds,
and I will deliver up the city and all that is in it.”
9 And if ten men remain in one house, they shall die.
10 And when one’s relative, the one who burns him,
takes him up to bring out the bones from the house,
and says to him who is in the innermost parts of the house,
“Is there still anyone with you?”
and he says, “No,”
he shall say, “Silence!
We must not mention the name of the LORD.”
11 For behold, the LORD commands,
and the great house shall be struck down into fragments,
and the little house into bits.


12 Do horses run on rocks?
Does one plow the sea with oxen?
But you have turned justice into poison
and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood—
13 you who rejoice in Lo-debar,
who say, “Have we not by our own strength
captured Karnaim for ourselves?”
14 “For look how I am raising up against you a nation,
O house of Israel,” declares the LORD, the God of hosts,
“and they shall oppress you from Lebo-hamath
to the Brook of the Arabah.”




Chapter 7


1 This is what the Lord GOD showed me: He was forming locusts at the beginning of the coming up of the latter growth, and it was the latter growth after the king’s mowing.
2 And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the grass of the land, that I said, “O Lord GOD, forgive, I beg You! How can Jacob stand? For he is small.”
3 The LORD relented concerning this. “It shall not be,” said the LORD.


4 This is what the Lord GOD showed me: the Lord GOD was calling for a judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the portion of land.
5 Then I said, “O Lord GOD, cease, I beg You! How can Jacob stand? For he is small.”
6 The LORD relented concerning this. “This also shall not be,” said the Lord GOD.


7 This is what He showed me: the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, and in His hand was a plumb line.
8 And the LORD said to me, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said, “Look how I am setting a plumb line in the midst of My people Israel; I will not again pass by them.
9 The high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”


10 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words.
11 For thus Amos has said, ‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely go into exile away from his land.’”
12 And Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and there you may prophesy.
13 But never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.”
14 Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, “I was no prophet, nor was I a prophet’s son, but I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs.
15 But the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’
16 Now therefore hear the word of the LORD: You say, ‘Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.’
17 Therefore thus says the LORD: ‘Your wife shall become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; you yourself shall die in an unclean land, and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.’”




Chapter 8


1 This is what the Lord GOD showed me: a basket of summer fruit.
2 And He said, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then the LORD said to me, “The end has come for My people Israel; I will not again pass by them.
3 The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,” declares the Lord GOD. “The dead bodies shall be many; in every place they shall cast them out in silence.”
4 Hear this, you who trample on the needy, to make the poor of the land fail,
5 saying, “When will the new moon pass, so that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath, so that we may open the wheat market—making the ephah small and the shekel great, and falsifying dishonest scales,
6 to buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and sell the refuse of the wheat?”
7 The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob, “Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.
8 Shall the land not tremble for this, and everyone who dwells in it mourn? And all of it shall rise up like the Nile; it shall be tossed about and subside like the Nile of Egypt.”
9 “And it shall come to pass in that day,” declares the Lord GOD, “that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in broad daylight.
10 And I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation. I will bring sackcloth on every waist and baldness on every head. I will make it like mourning for an only son, and its end like a bitter day.”


11 “Look! The days are coming,” declares the Lord GOD, “when I will send a famine in the land—not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.
12 They shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, but they shall not find it.
13 In that day the fair virgins and the young men shall faint from thirst.
14 Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria and say, ‘As your god lives, O Dan,’ and, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives’—they shall fall and never rise again.”




Chapter 9


1 I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said: “Strike the capitals so that the thresholds shake, and shatter them upon the heads of them all; and the last of them I will slay with the sword. Not one of them shall flee away, and not one of them shall escape.
2 Though they dig into the grave, My hand shall take them from there; and though they climb up to heaven, I will bring them down from there.
3 Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, I will search them out from there and take them; and though they hide from My eyes at the bottom of the sea, I will command the serpent that is there, and it shall bite them.
4 And though they go into captivity before their enemies, I will command the sword there, and it shall slay them. And I will set My eyes upon them for evil and not for good.”


5 The Lord, the GOD of Hosts—He who touches the earth so that it melts, and makes all who dwell in it mourn, and makes it rise up like the Nile, and sink again like the Nile of Egypt—
6 who builds His upper chambers in the heavens and has founded His vault upon the earth, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the surface of the earth—the LORD is His name.


7 “Aren't you like the sons of the Cushites to Me, O sons of Israel?” declares the LORD. “Didn't I bring Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Arameans from Kir?
8 See how the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it entirely from the face of the earth—except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” declares the LORD.
9 “For, I will command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations, as grain is shaken in a sieve, but not a pebble shall fall to the ground.
10 All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword, those who say, ‘Disaster shall not overtake or confront us.’”


11 “In that day I will raise up the fallen stronghold of David, and I will repair its breaches, and raise up its ruins, and rebuild it as in days of old,
12 that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations who are called by My name,” declares the LORD who does this.


13 “See, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when the plowman shall overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him who sows seed; and the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and all the hills shall flow with it.
14 I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel, and they shall rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine, and they shall make gardens and eat their fruit.
15 I will plant them upon their land, and they shall never again be uprooted from their land that I have given them,” says the LORD your God.﻿Obadiah


Chapter 1


1 The vision of Obadiah.
Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom:
We have heard a report from the LORD,
and an envoy has been sent among the nations:
“Rise up, and let us rise against her for battle!”
2 Behold, I will make you small among the nations;
you shall be utterly despised.
3 The pride of your heart has deceived you,
you who dwell in the clefts of the rock,
whose habitation is lofty.
Who can say in his heart,
“Who will bring me down to the ground?”
4 Though you soar aloft like the eagle,
and though your nest is set among the stars,
from there I will bring you down,
declares the LORD.


5 If thieves came to you,
if plunderers came by night—
how you have been destroyed!—
would they not steal only what they wanted?
If grape gatherers came to you,
would they not leave gleanings?
6 How Esau has been pillaged,
his hidden treasures sought out!
7 All your allies have driven you to the border;
your confederates have deceived you and prevailed against you;
those who eat your bread have set a trap beneath you—
you have no understanding.
8 Will I not on that day,
declares the LORD,
destroy the wise men out of Edom,
and understanding out of Mount Esau?
9 And your mighty men shall be dismayed, O Teman,
so that every man from Mount Esau
will be cut off by slaughter.
10 Because of the violence against your brother Jacob,
shame shall cover you,
and you shall be cut off forever.


11 On the day that you stood aloof,
on the day that strangers carried off his wealth,
and foreigners entered his gates
and cast lots for Jerusalem,
you were like one of them.
12 But you should not have gloated over your brother
on the day of his misfortune,
and you should not have rejoiced over the sons of Judah
on the day of their destruction,
and you should not have spoken arrogantly
on the day of distress.
13 You should not have entered the gate of my people
on the day of their disaster;
you should not have looked with gloating on his calamity
on the day of his disaster,
nor laid hands on his wealth
on the day of his disaster.
14 You should not have stood at the crossroads
to cut down his fugitives;
you should not have handed over his survivors
on the day of distress.


15 For the day of the LORD is near all the nations.
As you have done, it shall be done to you;
your deeds shall return upon your own head.
16 For just as you have drunk on my holy mountain,
so shall all the nations drink continually;
they shall drink and gulp down,
and shall be as though they had never been.
17 But on Mount Zion there shall be those who escape,
and it shall be holy,
and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
18 The house of Jacob shall be a fire,
and the house of Joseph a flame,
and the house of Esau stubble;
they shall burn them and consume them,
and there shall be no survivor for the house of Esau,
for the LORD has spoken.


19 Those of the Negev shall possess Mount Esau,
and those of the Shephelah the land of the Philistines;
they shall possess the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria,
and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
20 And the exiles of this host of the sons of Israel
shall possess the land of the Canaanites as far as Zarephath,
and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad
shall possess the cities of the Negev.
21 Deliverers shall go up to Mount Zion
to judge the mountain of Esau,
and the kingdom shall be the LORD’s.﻿Jonah


Chapter 1


1 The word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai, saying,
2 “Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it, for their evil has come up before Me.”


3 But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD.
4 But the LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty storm on the sea, so that they thought the ship would break apart.
5 Then the sailors were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the innermost part of the ship and had lain down and fallen fast asleep.
6 So the captain came to him and said, “Why are you sleeping? Arise, call on your god! Perhaps the god you serve will consider our situation, and we would not perish.”


7 Then they said to one another, “Come, let us cast lots, that we may know who caused this evil to come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.
8 Then they said to him, “Tell us, now—on whose account has this evil come upon us? What is your occupation, and where do you come from? What is your country, and from what people are you?”
9 And he said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”
10 Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him, “What have you done?” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.


11 Then they said to him, “What should we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?” For the sea was growing more and more stormy.
12 And he said to them, “Pick me up and hurl me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you. For I realize that it is because of me that this great storm has come upon you.”


13 Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to return to dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more stormy against them.
14 Then they cried out to the LORD and said, “O LORD, please do not let us perish because of this man’s life, and do not lay upon us innocent blood, for You, O LORD, have done as it pleased You.”


15 So they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging.
16 Then the men had great reverence for the LORD, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows.




Chapter 2


1 Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish,
2 and he said:
“I called out to the LORD in my distress, and He answered me;
out of the belly of the grave I cried for help, and You heard my voice.
3 For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas,
and the current surrounded me;
all Your breakers and Your waves passed over me.
4 Then I said, ‘I am driven out from before Your eyes;
yet I will again look toward Your holy temple.’
5 The waters closed in over me, even to threaten my life;
the deep surrounded me;
weeds were wrapped around my head
6 at the roots of the mountains.
I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me forever;
yet You brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.
7 When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD,
and my prayer came to You, into Your holy temple.
8 Those who cling to worthless idols forsake their loyalty,
9 but I, with the voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You;
what I have vowed I will fulfill.
Salvation belongs to the LORD.”


10 And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out onto dry land.




Chapter 3


1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time, saying,
2 “Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the proclamation that I speak to you.”
3 So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city—a three-day journey across.
4 Jonah began to enter the city on a day's journey, and he cried out and said, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh will be destroyed!”
5 And the men of Nineveh believed God. They called for a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them.


6 When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, took off his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
7 Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh, saying, “By decree of the king and his nobles: No man or beast, herd or flock, shall taste anything. They shall not eat or drink water.
8 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. Let them call out mightily to God. Let each turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands.
9 Who knows? God may turn and relent, and turn from His burning anger, so that we do not perish.”


10 And God saw their deeds—that they turned from their evil ways—and God relented of the disaster that He had said He would do to them, and He did not do it.




Chapter 4


1 But it greatly displeased Jonah, and he became angry.
2 He prayed to the LORD and said, “O LORD, was this not what I said while I was still in my land? That is why I fled to Tarshish earlier. For I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and one who relents from sending disaster.
3 So now, LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.”
4 And the LORD said, “Is it right for you to be angry?”


5 Then Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city. There he made for himself a shelter and sat under it in the shade, until he should see what would become of the city.
6 And the LORD God appointed a plant, and it grew up over Jonah to provide shade for his head, to deliver him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant.


7 But at dawn the next day, God appointed a worm, and it attacked the plant, and it withered.
8 And when the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head, so that he grew faint. And he asked to die, and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.”
9 Then God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?” And he said, “It is right for me to be angry—angry enough to die.”


10 And the LORD said, “You have shown pity on the plant for which you did not labor, and which you did not cause to grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night.
11 And should I not show pity on Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than one hundred twenty thousand men who do not know their right hand from their left, and also many beasts?”﻿Micah


Chapter 1


1 The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
2 Hear, O you nations, all of you; listen, O earth and all that is in it. And let the Lord GOD be a witness against you, the Lord from His holy temple.
3 For behold, the LORD is coming out of His place, and He will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.


4 The mountains shall melt beneath Him, and the valleys will split apart like wax before the fire, like waters poured down a steep place.
5 All this is because of the transgression of Jacob and because of the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem?


6 Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country, a place for planting vineyards; and I will pour down her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations.
7 All her carved images shall be broken in pieces, and all her earnings shall be burned with fire, and all her idols I will destroy. For from the wages of a harlot she gathered them, and to the wages of a harlot they shall return.


8 Because of this I will lament and wail; I will go barefoot and naked; I will make a wailing like jackals and a mourning like ostriches.
9 For her wound is incurable, and it has come to Judah; it has reached the gate of my people, to Jerusalem.


10 Do not tell it in Gath; do not weep at all. In Beth-leaphrah, roll yourself in the dust.
11 Pass on, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame; the inhabitant of Zaanan has not come out. The lamentation of Beth-ezel will take away its support from you.
12 For the inhabitant of Maroth trembled for good, because disaster has come down from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem.
13 Harness the chariot to the steeds, O inhabitant of Lachish. She was the beginning of sin for the daughter of Zion, for in you were found the transgressions of Israel.
14 Therefore you shall give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath. The houses of Achzib shall be a deception to the kings of Israel.
15 I will again bring a conqueror to you, O inhabitant of Mareshah. The glory of Israel shall come to Adullam.


16 Shave yourself bald and cut off your hair for the sons of your delight; enlarge your baldness like the eagle, for they have gone from you into exile.




Chapter 2


1 Woe to those who devise wickedness and plan evil on their beds! At morning light they do it, because it is in the power of their hand.
2 They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them away; they oppress a man and his house, a man and his inheritance.


3 Therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I am planning evil against this clan, from which you shall not remove your necks; and you shall not walk haughtily, for it will be an evil time.
4 In that day one shall take up a taunt against you and lament with bitter lamentation, saying, “We are utterly ruined! He changes the portion of my people; how He removes it from me! To the unfaithful He allots our fields.”
5 Therefore you shall have none who casts the measuring line by lot in the assembly of the LORD.


6 “Do not preach”—thus they preach—“one should not preach of such things; disgrace will not overtake us.”
7 Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, “Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these His deeds?” Do not My words do good to him who walks uprightly?
8 But lately My people has risen up as an enemy; you strip the robe from off the garment from those who pass by securely, as men averse to war.
9 The women of My people you drive out from their pleasant houses; from their young children you take away My splendor forever.


10 Arise and go, for this is no resting place, because of uncleanness that destroys, even with a grievous destruction.
11 If a man walking in wind and falsehood lies, saying, “I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,” he would be the preacher for this people.


12 I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will surely assemble the remnant of Israel; I will put them together like sheep in a fold, like a flock in the midst of its pasture—a noisy multitude of men.
13 He who breaks through has gone up before them; they have broken through and passed the gate and gone out by it. And their king passes on before them, the LORD at their head.




Chapter 3


1 And I said, “Hear now, heads of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know justice?
2 You who hate good and love evil, who tear off their skin from them and their flesh from off their bones,
3 who eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them up like meat for the pot, like flesh in the midst of a caldron.”


4 Then they will cry to the LORD, but He will not answer them; He will hide His face from them at that time, because they have practiced evil deeds.


5 Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who bite with their teeth and cry, “Peace,” but whoever does not put something in their mouths, they sanctify war against him:
6 "Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision, and darkness to you, without divination. And the sun shall go down on the prophets, and the day shall grow dark over them.
7 The seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners confounded; they shall all cover their lips, for there is no answer from God."


8 But as for me, I am filled with power—by the Spirit of the LORD—and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin.


9 Hear this, now, heads of the house of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel, who abhor justice and twist everything that is straight,
10 who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with injustice:
11 "Her heads render judgment for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets divine for silver—yet they lean on the LORD, saying, 'Is not the LORD in our midst? No evil shall come upon us.'"


12 Therefore because of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.




Chapter 4


1 But it shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and it shall be lifted up above the hills, and peoples shall stream to it.
2 And many nations shall come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob, that He may teach us His ways, and we may walk in His paths.” For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
3 And He shall judge between many peoples, and shall decide for strong nations far away; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nor shall they learn war anymore.
4 But every man shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree, and none shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken.
5 For all the peoples walk, each in the name of his god, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.


6 “In that day,” declares the LORD, “I will gather the lame and assemble the outcast and those whom I have afflicted.
7 And I will make the lame a remnant, and the outcast a strong nation; and the LORD shall reign over them on Mount Zion from now on and forever.
8 And you, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you it shall come—yes, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.”


9 Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pangs have seized you like a woman in labor?
10 Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you shall go out from the city and dwell in the field and go to Babylon. There you shall be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.


11 Now many nations have gathered against you, saying, “Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gaze upon Zion.”
12 But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD, and they do not understand His counsel, for He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
13 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hooves bronze; and you shall crush many peoples, and you shall devote their unjust gain to the LORD, and their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.




Chapter 5


1 Now muster your troops, O daughter of troops; a siege has been laid against us. With a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the cheek.
2 But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for Me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose origin is from of old, from ancient days.
3 Therefore He shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; then the remnant of His brothers shall return to the children of Israel.
4 And He shall stand and shepherd His flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD His God. And they shall dwell secure, for now He shall be great to the ends of the earth.


5 And He shall be their peace. When the Assyrian comes into our land and treads in our palaces, then we will raise against him seven shepherds and eight princes of men.
6 And they shall shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod at its entrances. And He shall deliver us from the Assyrian when he comes into our land and treads within our borders.


7 Then the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for man nor delay for the sons of men.
8 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, who, when he passes through, tramples and tears in pieces, and there is none to deliver.


9 Your hand shall be lifted up over your adversaries, and all your enemies shall be cut off.
10 "And in that day," declares the LORD, "I will cut off your horses from among you and will destroy your chariots.
11 And I will cut off the cities of your land and throw down all your strongholds.
12 And I will cut off sorceries from your hand, and you shall have no more soothsayers.
13 And I will cut off your carved images and your pillars from among you, and you shall bow down no more to the work of your hands.
14 And I will root out your Asherim from among you and destroy your cities.
15 And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations that did not obey."




Chapter 6


1 Hear now what the LORD says: "Arise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.
2 Hear, O mountains, the indictment of the LORD, and you enduring foundations of the earth, for the LORD has a case against His people, and with Israel He will contend."


3 O My people, what have I done to you? And how have I wearied you? Answer Me.
4 For I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of bondage, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
5 O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam son of Beor answered him, and what happened from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the LORD.


6 With what shall I come before the LORD and bow down to God on high? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?
7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?


8 He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?


9 The voice of the LORD calls to the city— wisdom fears Your name— hear the rod and Him who appointed it.
10 Are there still treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is accursed?
11 Shall I acquit a man with dishonest scales, with a bag of false weights?
12 Her rich men are full of violence, her inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.


13 Therefore I will also strike you with a grievous blow, making you desolate because of your sins.
14 You shall eat, but not be satisfied, and your emptiness shall remain within you; you shall store up, but not preserve, and what you preserve I will give to the sword.
15 You shall sow, but not reap; you shall tread olives, but not anoint yourself with oil; and grapes, but not drink wine.
16 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and you walk in their counsels, that I may make you a desolation and your inhabitants a hissing. Therefore you shall bear the reproach of My people.




Chapter 7


1 Woe is me! For I have become like one who gathers summer fruit, like gleanings of the grape harvest— there is no cluster to eat, no first-ripe fig that my soul desires.
2 The godly has perished from the land, and there is no upright among men; all of them lie in wait for blood; each hunts his brother with a net.
3 Both hands are skilled to do evil; the prince demands, and the judge is ready for a bribe, and the great man utters the evil desire of his soul— thus they weave it together.


4 The best of them is like a brier; the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen— your punishment— has come; now shall be their confusion.
5 Do not trust in a companion, do not rely on a close friend; guard the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom.
6 For son dishonors father, daughter rises up against her mother, daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own household.


7 But as for me, I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me.
8 Rejoice not over me, O my enemy! When I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me.
9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD because I have sinned against Him, until He pleads my cause and executes judgment for me. He will bring me out to the light; I shall behold His righteousness.
10 Then my enemy will see, and shame will cover her who said to me, “Where is the LORD your God?” My eyes will look upon her; now she will be trampled like mud in the streets.


11 A day for building your walls— on that day the boundary shall be extended.
12 In that day they will come to you, from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt to the River, from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
13 But the earth shall be desolate because of its inhabitants, for the fruit of their deeds.


14 Shepherd Your people with Your staff, the flock of Your inheritance, who dwell alone in a forest in the midst of a garden land. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old.
15 As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show them wondrous things.
16 Nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hands on their mouths; their ears shall be deaf.
17 They shall lick the dust like a serpent, like crawling things of the earth; they shall come trembling out of their strongholds; to the LORD our God they shall turn in dread, and they shall be afraid before You.


18 Who is a God like You, pardoning iniquity and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He does not retain His anger forever, because He delights in steadfast love.
19 He will again have compassion on us; He will tread our iniquities underfoot. You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
20 You will show faithfulness to Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham, as You swore to our fathers from days of old.﻿Nahum


Chapter 1


1 The oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.


2 The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is full of wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on his adversaries and reserves wrath for his enemies.
3 The LORD is slow to anger and great in power, but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.


4 He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and he dries up all the rivers; Bashan and Carmel wither, and the bloom of Lebanon fades.
5 The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt; the earth heaves before him, the world and all who dwell in it.
6 Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the heat of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him.


7 The LORD is good, a stronghold in the day of distress; he knows those who take refuge in him.
8 But with an overflowing flood he will make a complete end of its place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.


9 What do you plot against the LORD? He will make a complete end of it; trouble will not rise up a second time.
10 For they are entangled like thorns and drunk like drunkards; they are consumed like stubble fully dry.
11 From you came one who plotted evil against the LORD, a worthless counselor.


12 Thus says the LORD, “Though they are at full strength and many in number, they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.
13 And now I will break his yoke from off you, and will tear away your bonds.”


14 The LORD has commanded concerning you: “No more of your name shall be sown; from the house of your gods I will cut off the carved image and the metal image. I will make your grave, for you are vile.”




Chapter 2


1 A scatterer has come up against you. Guard the rampart; watch the road; brace your loins; strengthen your power mightily.
2 For the LORD is restoring the majesty of Jacob as the majesty of Israel, though ravagers have ravaged them and ruined their vine branches.


3 The shields of his mighty men are red; his warriors are clothed in scarlet. The chariots flash like fire on the day of his preparation, and the spears are brandished.
4 The chariots race madly through the streets; they rush to and fro through the squares; their appearance is like torches, they dart like lightning.


5 He calls his officers; they stumble as they march. They hasten to the wall, and the siege tower is set up.
6 The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace melts away.
7 She is stripped, she is carried off—her servant girls moan like the sound of doves, beating their breasts.
8 Nineveh is like a pool whose waters run away. “Halt! Halt!” they cry, but none turns back.


9 Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! There is no end to the treasure, wealth beyond all measure.
10 Desolation, emptiness, and waste! Hearts melt and knees give way; anguish is in all loins; all faces grow pale.


11 Where is the den of lions, the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and lioness went, where his cubs were, with none to make them afraid?
12 The lion tore enough for his cubs and strangled prey for his lionesses; he filled his caves with prey and his dens with torn flesh.


13 “I am against you,” declares the LORD of hosts, “and I will burn your chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall no longer be heard.”




Chapter 3


1 Woe to the city of blood! She is all full of lies and plunder; the prey never departs.
2 The crack of the whip, and the rumble of the wheel, galloping horse and bounding chariot!
3 Horsemen charging, flashing sword and glittering spear, hosts of slain, heaps of corpses, dead bodies without end—they stumble over the dead.


4 Because of the many harlotries of the harlot, the charming and graceful mistress of sorceries, who sells nations through her harlotries, and clans through her sorceries,
5 “I am against you,” declares the LORD of hosts. “I will lift up your skirts over your face; I will show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame.
6 I will throw filth on you and treat you with contempt, and make you a spectacle.
7 And all who see you will shrink from you and say, ‘Nineveh is devastated! Who will grieve for her?’ Where shall I seek comforters for you?”


8 Are you better than Thebes, that sat by the Nile, with water around her, whose rampart was the sea, water her wall?
9 Cush was her strength, Egypt too, without limit; Put and the Libyans were her helpers.
10 Yet she went into exile; she went into captivity. Her infants were dashed in pieces at the head of every street; they cast lots for her honored men, and all her great men were bound in chains.


11 You also will become drunk; you will go into hiding; you will seek refuge from the enemy.
12 All your fortresses are like fig trees with first-ripe figs—if shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.
13 Behold, your people are women in your midst; the gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has devoured your bars.


14 Draw water for the siege; strengthen your fortresses; go into the clay; tread the mortar; take hold of the brick mold!
15 There fire will consume you; the sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the locust. Multiply yourselves like the locust; multiply like the grasshopper!
16 You increased your merchants more than the stars of the heavens. The locust strips and flies away.
17 Your guards are like locusts, your scribes like swarms of locusts settling on the fences in a day of cold—when the sun rises, they fly away, and no one knows where they are.


18 Your shepherds are asleep, O king of Assyria; your nobles slumber. Your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no one to gather them.
19 There is no healing for your wound; your injury is fatal. All who hear the news about you clap their hands over you. For upon whom has your evil not passed continually?﻿Habakkuk


Chapter 1


1 The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw:
2 How long, O LORD, shall I cry for help, and You do not hear? I cry out to You, “Violence!” and You do not save.
3 Why do You make me see iniquity, and why do You idly look at trouble? Destruction and violence are before me; strife arises, and contention escalates.
4 Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never goes forth. For the wicked surround the righteous causing justice to come out perverted.
5 “Look among the nations, and see; be astonished, be utterly amazed! For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if it were told.
6 For you will see me raising up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, who march through the breadth of the earth to seize dwellings not their own.
7 They are dreadful and fearsome; their justice and dignity go forth from themselves.
8 Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their horsemen gallop; their horsemen come from afar; they fly like an eagle swooping to devour.
9 All of them come for violence, their faces set forward. They gather captives like sand.
10 They scoff at kings, and rulers are a joke to them. They laugh at every fortress, for they heap up earth and capture it.
11 Then they sweep by like the wind and go on—guilty men, whose own strength is their god!”


12 Are You not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O LORD, You have appointed them for judgment, and You, O Rock, have established them for reproof.
13 You, whose eyes are too pure to look upon evil, and who cannot look on wrong—why do You look on traitors and remain silent when the wicked swallows up the man more righteous than he?
14 You make mankind like the fish of the sea, like crawling things that have no ruler over them.
15 He brings all of them up with a hook; he drags them out with his net; he gathers them in his dragnet, so he rejoices and is glad.
16 Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by them his portion is fat, and his food is rich.
17 Shall he then empty his net and keep on slaying nations without mercy?




Chapter 2


1 I will stand at my watchpost and station myself on the rampart; I will keep watch to see what He will say to me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint.
2 And the LORD answered me and said: “Write the vision and make it plain on tablets, so that the one who reads it may run.
3 For the vision is yet for the appointed time; it speaks of the end and does not lie. If it delays, wait for it; for it will surely come—it will not be late.


4 See how his soul is puffed up—it is not upright in him; but the righteous shall live by his faithfulness.
5 Moreover, wine is a traitor, an arrogant man who is never at rest. He enlarges his desire like the grave, and like death he never has enough. He gathers for himself all the nations and collects for himself all the peoples.”
6 Shall not all these take up a taunt against him, with riddles and mocking sayings, and say: “Woe to him who heaps up what is not his—how long?—and loads himself with pledges”?
7 Will not your creditors suddenly rise, and those who make you tremble awake? Then you will become spoil for them.
8 Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder you—for the blood of man and violence to the land, to the city and all who dwell in it.
9 Woe to him who obtains ill-gotten gain for his house, to set his nest on high, to escape from the grasp of disaster!
10 You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many peoples; you have forfeited your life.
11 For the stone will cry out from the wall, and the beam from the timber will answer it.
12 Woe to him who builds a city with blood and founds a town by iniquity!
13 Is it not from the LORD of hosts that peoples labor only for fire, and nations weary themselves for nothing?
14 For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.
15 Woe to him who makes his neighbor drink—mixing in your wrath and making them drunk, to gaze upon their nakedness!
16 You will be filled with shame rather than glory. Drink, you too, and expose your uncircumcision! The cup in the LORD’s right hand will come around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.
17 For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of beasts will terrify you—for the blood of man and violence to the land, to the city and all who dwell in it.
18 What profit is an idol when its maker has shaped it—a cast image, a teacher of lies? For the one who forms it trusts in what he has made, when he fashions speechless idols!
19 Woe to him who says to wood, “Awake!” or to silent stone, “Arise!” Can it teach? You see how it is overlaid with gold and silver, but there is no breath at all in it.


20 But the LORD is in His holy temple; let all the earth be silent before Him.




Chapter 3


1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.
2 LORD, I have heard the report about You;
I stand in awe, LORD, of Your work.
In the midst of the years, revive it;
in the midst of the years, make it known;
in wrath, remember mercy.
3 God came from Teman,
the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah.
His splendor covered the heavens,
and the earth was full of His praise.
4 His radiance was like the light;
rays came from His hand,
and there His power was hidden.
5 Before Him went pestilence,
and plague followed at His heels.
6 He stood and measured the earth;
He looked and made the nations tremble.
The eternal mountains were shattered;
the ancient hills sank low.
His paths are everlasting.


7 I saw the tents of Cushan in distress;
the tent curtains of the land of Midian trembled.
8 Was Your anger against the rivers, LORD?
Was Your wrath against the rivers,
or Your rage against the sea,
when You rode on Your horses,
on Your chariots of salvation?
9 You uncovered Your bow;
You called for many arrows. Selah.
You split the earth with rivers.
10 The mountains saw You and writhed;
a torrent of water passed by.
The deep roared and lifted its waves high.
11 Sun and moon stood still in their lofty abode,
at the light of Your arrows as they sped,
at the gleam of Your flashing spear.
12 In fury You marched through the earth;
in anger You threshed the nations.
13 You went out for the salvation of
Your people, for the salvation of Your anointed.
You struck the head of the house of the wicked,
laying him bare from thigh to neck. Selah.


14 With his own spears You pierced the heads of his warriors,
who came like a whirlwind to scatter me,
gloating as if to devour the afflicted in secret.
15 You trampled the sea with Your horses,
the surging of mighty waters.
16 I heard, and my inward parts trembled;
at the sound, my lips quivered.
Rottenness entered into my bones,
and I trembled where I stood,
because I must quietly wait for the day of distress
to come upon the people who invade us.
17 Though the fig tree does not blossom,
and there is no fruit on the vines,
though the yield of the olive fails,
and the fields produce no food,
though the flock is cut off from the fold,
and there are no cattle in the stalls,
18 yet I will rejoice in the LORD;
I will exult in the God of my salvation.
19 The Lord GOD is my strength;
He makes my feet like the feet of a deer
and makes me tread upon my high places.
To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments.﻿Zephaniah


Chapter 1


1 The word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah:
2 “I will utterly sweep away everything from the face of the earth,” declares the LORD.
3 “I will sweep away man and beast; I will sweep away the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, and the stumbling blocks along with the wicked. I will cut off man from the face of the earth,” declares the LORD.


4 “I will stretch out My hand against Judah and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and I will cut off from this place the remnant of Baal, the name of the idolatrous priests along with the priests,
5 those who bow down on the housetops to the host of heaven, those who bow down and swear to the LORD and also swear by Milcom,
6 and those who have turned back from following the LORD, and those who have not sought the LORD nor inquired of Him.
7 Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near, for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice; He has consecrated His guests.
8 And on the day of the LORD’s sacrifice I will punish the princes and the king’s sons and all who array themselves in foreign garments.
9 On that day I will punish everyone who leaps over the threshold, who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.”


10 “And on that day,” declares the LORD, “a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, a wail from the Second Quarter, and a loud crash from the hills.
11 Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar! For all the people of Canaan are undone; all who weigh out silver are cut off.
12 At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are settled on their dregs, who say in their hearts, ‘The LORD will not do good, nor will He do evil.’
13 Their wealth will become plunder, and their houses a desolation. Though they build houses, they will not inhabit them; though they plant vineyards, they will not drink their wine.”


14 The great day of the LORD is near, near and coming very quickly. The sound of the day of the LORD is bitter; there the mighty man cries aloud.
15 That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of ruin and devastation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
16 a day of trumpet blast and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the high towers.


17 “I will bring distress upon mankind, so that they will walk like the blind, because they have sinned against the LORD; and their blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung.”
18 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them on the day of the LORD’s wrath. And in the fire of His jealousy all the earth will be consumed; for He will make a complete end, a sudden destruction of all the inhabitants of the earth.




Chapter 2


1 Gather yourselves together—yes, gather, O shameless nation,
2 before the decree takes effect, before the day passes like chaff, before the burning anger of the LORD comes upon you, before the day of the LORD’s anger comes upon you.
3 Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land who carry out His justice; seek righteousness, seek humility—perhaps you will be hidden on the day of the LORD’s anger.
4 For Gaza shall be abandoned, and Ashkelon shall become a desolation; Ashdod shall be driven out at noon, and Ekron shall be uprooted.
5 Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: “I will destroy you, so that there will be no inhabitant.”
6 And the seacoast shall become pastures, with meadows for shepherds and folds for flocks.
7 And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall pasture on it. In the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down in the evening, for the LORD their God will visit them and restore their fortunes.


8 “I have heard the taunts of Moab and the revilings of the sons of Ammon, with which they have reproached My people and made boasts against their territory.
9 Therefore, as I live,” declares the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, “surely Moab shall be like Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah— a place of weeds and salt pits, and a perpetual desolation. The remnant of My people shall plunder them, and the remainder of My nation shall possess them.”
10 This they shall have as punishment for their pride, because they taunted and boasted against the people of the LORD of hosts.
11 They will fear the LORD, for He will famish all the gods of the earth, and all the coastlands of the nations shall bow down to Him, each one from its place.


12 “You also, O Cushites, shall be slain by My sword.”
13 And He will stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria, and He will make Nineveh a desolation, dry as the wilderness.
14 Herds shall lie down in her midst, every kind of beast; the desert owl and the screech owl shall roost on her capitals; a voice shall hoot in the window; desolation shall be on the threshold, for He has laid bare the cedar work.
15 This is the exultant city that dwelt securely, that said in her heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me.” What a desolation she has become, a lair for beasts! Everyone who passes by her hisses and waves his hand.




Chapter 3


1 Woe to the rebellious and defiled city, the oppressing one!
2 She did not listen to the voice; she did not receive correction. She did not trust in the LORD; she did not draw near to her God.
3 Her princes in her midst are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves—they leave nothing for the morning.
4 Her prophets are reckless, treacherous men. Her priests profane what is holy; they do violence to the law.
5 The LORD is righteous in her midst; He does no injustice. Morning by morning He renders His judgment; at dawn He does not fail. But the unjust one knows no shame.
6 “I have cut off nations; their corner towers are desolate. I have made their streets waste, with no one passing by. Their cities are destroyed, without a man to inhabit them.


7 I said, ‘Surely you will fear Me; you will accept correction!’ Then her dwelling would not be cut off, despite everything for which I had punished her. But they eagerly corrupted all their deeds.”
8 “Therefore wait for Me,” declares the LORD, “for the day I rise up to plunder. For My decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out on them My indignation, all My burning anger. For by the fire of My jealousy all the earth will be consumed.
9 And then I will make the peoples speak a pure language, so that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve Him with one accord.


10 From beyond the rivers of Cush My worshipers, the daughter of My dispersed ones, will bring My offering.
11 On that day you will not be ashamed because of all your deeds by which you rebelled against Me. For then I will remove from your midst those who exult in pride, and you shall no longer be haughty on My holy mountain.
12 But I will leave in your midst a meek and humble people, and they shall take refuge in the name of the LORD.
13 The remnant of Israel shall do no injustice and speak no lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths. For they shall feed and lie down, and no one shall make them afraid.


14 Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!
15 The LORD has taken away your judgments; He has turned away your enemy. The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall no longer fear evil.
16 On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, “Do not fear, O Zion; do not let your hands grow weak.
17 The LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with gladness; He will quiet you with His love; He will exult over you with singing.”


18 “I will gather those who grieve for the appointed festivals—you were a burden on her; reproach was upon them.
19 Behold, at that time I will deal with all who oppress you. I will save the lame and gather the outcast, and I will make them a praise and a name in every land of their shame.
20 At that time I will bring you in; at that time I will gather you. For I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes,” says the LORD.﻿Haggai


Chapter 1


1 In the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest:
2 “Thus says the LORD of hosts:
These people say, ‘The time has not yet come
to rebuild the house of the LORD.’”


3 Then the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet:
4 “Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses,
while this house lies in ruins?
5 Now therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts:
Consider your ways.
6 You have sown much, and harvested little.
You eat, but you never have enough.
You drink, but you never have your fill.
You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm.
And he who earns wages
does so to put them into a bag with holes.


7 Thus says the LORD of hosts:
Consider your ways.
8 Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house,
that I may take pleasure in it
and that I may be glorified, says the LORD.
9 You looked for much, and behold, it came to little.
And when you brought it home, I blew it away.
Why? declares the LORD of hosts.
Because of My house that lies in ruins,
while each of you busies himself with his own house.
10 Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew,
and the earth has withheld its produce.
11 And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills,
on the grain, the new wine, the oil,
on what the ground brings forth,
on man and beast,
and on all their labors.”


12 Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him. And the people feared the LORD.
13 Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke to the people with the LORD’s message:
“I am with you, declares the LORD.”
14 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah,
and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest,
and the spirit of all the remnant of the people.
And they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
15 on the twenty-fourth day of the month,
in the sixth month,
in the second year of King Darius.




Chapter 2


1 In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet:
2 “Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah,
and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest,
and to all the remnant of the people, and say,
3 ‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory?
And how do you see it now?
Is it not as nothing in your eyes?
4 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, declares the LORD.
Be strong, O Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
Be strong, all you people of the land, declares the LORD.
Work, for I am with you, declares the LORD of hosts,
5 according to the covenant that I made with you
when you came out of Egypt.
My Spirit remains in your midst.
Do not fear.’


6 For thus says the LORD of hosts:
Yet once more, in a little while,
I will shake the heavens and the earth
and the sea and the dry land.
7 And I will shake all nations,
so that the treasures of all nations shall come in,
and I will fill this house with glory,
says the LORD of hosts.
8 The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine,
declares the LORD of hosts.
9 The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former,
says the LORD of hosts.
And in this place I will give peace,
declares the LORD of hosts.”


10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month,
in the second year of Darius,
the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet:
11 “Thus says the LORD of hosts:
Ask the priests about the law:
12 ‘If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment
and touches with his fold bread or stew or wine or oil
or any kind of food,
does it become holy?’”
The priests answered and said, “No.”


13 Then Haggai said,
“If someone who is unclean by contact with a dead body
touches any of these,
does it become unclean?”
The priests answered and said, “It does become unclean.”
14 Then Haggai answered and said,
“So it is with this people, and with this nation before Me, declares the LORD,
and so with every work of their hands.
And what they offer there is unclean.
15 Now then, consider from this day onward.
Before stone was placed upon stone in the temple of the LORD,
16 how did you fare?
When one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten.
When one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were but twenty.
17 I struck you and all the products of your toil
with blight and mildew and hail,
yet you did not turn to Me, declares the LORD.
18 Consider from this day onward,
from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month.
Since the day that the foundation of the LORD’s temple was laid,
consider:
19 Is the seed yet in the barn?
Indeed, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have yielded nothing.
But from this day on I will bless you.”


20 The word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai
on the twenty-fourth day of the month:
21 “Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying,
I am about to shake the heavens and the earth,
22 and to overthrow the throne of kingdoms.
I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations,
and overthrow the chariots and their riders.
And the horses and their riders shall go down,
every one by the sword of his brother.
23 On that day, declares the LORD of hosts,
I will take you, O Zerubbabel My servant, the son of Shealtiel,
declares the LORD,
and make you like a signet ring,
for I have chosen you, declares the LORD of hosts.”﻿Zechariah


Chapter 1


1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
2 “The LORD was very angry with your fathers.
3 Therefore say to them, Thus declares the LORD of hosts:
Return to Me, declares the LORD of hosts,
and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts.
4 Do not be like your fathers,
to whom the former prophets cried out,
‘Thus says the LORD of hosts,
Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.’
But they did not hear or pay attention to Me,
declares the LORD.
5 Your fathers—where are they?
And the prophets—do they live forever?
6 But My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets,
did they not overtake your fathers?
So they repented and said,
‘As the LORD of hosts purposed to deal with us
for our ways and our deeds,
so has He dealt with us.’”


7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat,
in the second year of Darius,
the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah,
the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying,
8 I looked in the night, and saw
a man riding on a red horse!
He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen,
and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
9 Then I said, “What are these, my lord?”
The angel who talked with me said to me,
“I will show you what they are.”
10 So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered,
“These are the ones whom the LORD has sent
to patrol the earth.”
11 And they answered the angel of the LORD
who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said,
“We have patrolled the earth,
and all the earth remains at rest.”
12 Then the angel of the LORD said,
“O LORD of hosts,
how long will You have no mercy on Jerusalem
and the cities of Judah,
against which You have been angry
these seventy years?”
13 And the LORD answered the angel who talked with me
with gracious and comforting words.


14 So the angel who talked with me said to me,
“Cry out, Thus says the LORD of hosts:
I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion.
15 And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are at ease;
for while I was only a little angry,
they added to the calamity.
16 Therefore, thus says the LORD:
I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy;
My house shall be built in it,
declares the LORD of hosts,
and a measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.
17 Cry out again, Thus says the LORD of hosts:
My cities shall again overflow with prosperity,
and the LORD will again comfort Zion
and again choose Jerusalem.”


18 And I lifted my eyes and saw,
and behold, four horns.
19 And I said to the angel who talked with me,
“What are these?”
And he said to me,
“These are the horns that have scattered Judah,
Israel, and Jerusalem.”


20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
21 And I said, “What are these coming to do?”
He said, “These are the horns that scattered Judah,
so that no one raised his head.
And these have come to terrify them,
to cast down the horns of the nations
that lifted up their horn
against the land of Judah to scatter it.”




Chapter 2


1 And I lifted my eyes and looked
and I saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.
2 Then I said, “Where are you going?”
And he said to me, “To measure Jerusalem,
to see what is its width and what is its length.”


3 And the angel who talked with me went out,
and another angel went out to meet him,
4 and said to him, “Run, say to that young man,
‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls,
because of the multitude of men and livestock in it.
5 And I will be to her a wall of fire all around,
declares the LORD,
and I will be the glory in her midst.’”


6 Up! Up! Flee from the land of the north,
declares the LORD;
for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of heaven,
declares the LORD.
7 Up! Escape to Zion,
you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.
8 For thus said the LORD of hosts,
after His glory sent Me to the nations who plundered you,
for he who touches you touches the apple of His eye:
9 Behold, I will shake My hand over them,
and they shall become plunder for those who served them.
Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me.


10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion,
for behold, I come and I will dwell in your midst,
declares the LORD.
11 And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day,
and shall be My people.
And I will dwell in your midst,
and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you.
12 And the LORD will inherit Judah as His portion in the holy land,
and will again choose Jerusalem.
13 Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD,
for He has roused Himself from His holy dwelling.




Chapter 3


1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD,
and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.
2 And the LORD said to Satan,
“The LORD rebuke you, O Satan!
The LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!
Is not this a brand plucked from the fire?”


3 Now Joshua was standing before the angel,
clothed with filthy garments.
4 And the angel said to those who were standing before him,
“Remove the filthy garments from him.”
And to him he said,
“Behold, I have taken your iniquity away from you,
and I will clothe you with pure vestments.”


5 And I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.”
So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments.
And the angel of the LORD was standing by.
6 And the angel of the LORD solemnly charged Joshua,
7 “Thus says the LORD of hosts:
If you will walk in My ways
and keep My charge,
then you shall rule My house
and have charge of My courts,
and I will give you access among those who are standing here.
8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest,
you and your companions who sit before you,
for they are men who are a sign:
Look! I will bring My servant, the Branch.
9 For on the stone that I have set before Joshua,
on a single stone with seven eyes,
I will engrave its inscription,
declares the LORD of hosts,
and I will remove the iniquity of this land
in a single day.
10 In that day, declares the LORD of hosts,
every man will invite his neighbor
to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.”




Chapter 4


1 And the angel who talked with me came again and woke me,
like a man who is awakened out of his sleep.
2 And he said to me, “What do you see?”
I said, “I see a lampstand all of gold,
with a bowl on the top of it,
and seven lamps on it,
with seven lips on each of the lamps
that are on the top of it.
3 And there are two olive trees by it,
one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”


4 And I said to the angel who talked with me,
“What are these, my lord?”
5 Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me,
“Do you not know what these are?”
I said, “No, my lord.”
6 Then he said to me,
“This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel:
Not by might, nor by power,
but by My Spirit,
says the LORD of hosts.
7 Who are you, O great mountain?
Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain.
And he shall bring forward the top stone
amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’”


8 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
9 “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house;
his hands shall also complete it.
Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
10 For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice,
and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.
These seven are the eyes of the LORD,
which range through the whole earth.”


11 Then I said to him, “What are these two olive trees
on the right and the left of the lampstand?”
12 And a second time I answered and said to him,
“What are these two branches of the olive trees,
which are beside the two golden pipes
from which the golden oil is poured out?”
13 He said to me,
“Do you not know what these are?”
I said, “No, my lord.”
14 Then he said,
“These are the two sons of oil
who stand by the Lord of all the earth.”




Chapter 5


1 Again I lifted my eyes and looked,
and I saw a flying scroll.
2 And he said to me, “What do you see?”
I answered, “I see a flying scroll.
Its length is twenty cubits,
and its width, ten cubits.”


3 Then he said to me, “This is the curse
that goes out over the face of the whole land.
For everyone who steals shall be purged away
according to what is on one side,
and everyone who swears falsely
shall be purged away according to what is on the other side.
4 I will send it out, declares the LORD of hosts,
and it shall enter the house of the thief,
and the house of him who swears falsely by My name.
And it shall remain in his house and consume it,
both timber and stones.”


5 Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me,
“Lift your eyes and see what this is that is going out.”
6 And I said, “What is it?”
He said, “This is the measuring basket that is going out.”
And he said, “This is their iniquity in all the land.”


7 And I saw that the lead cover was lifted,
and there was a woman sitting in the basket.
8 And he said, “This is Wickedness.”
And he thrust her back into the basket,
and thrust down the leaden weight on its opening.


9 Then I lifted my eyes and looked,
and I saw two women coming forward!
The wind was in their wings.
They had wings like the wings of a stork,
and they lifted up the basket between earth and heaven.
10 Then I said to the angel who talked with me,
“Where are they taking the basket?”
11 He said to me, “To the land of Shinar,
to build a house for it.
And when this is prepared,
they will set the basket down there on its base.”




Chapter 6


1 And again I lifted my eyes and looked,
and I saw four chariots came out from between two mountains,
and the mountains were mountains of bronze.
2 The first chariot had red horses,
the second chariot black horses,
3 the third chariot white horses,
and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong.


4 Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me,
“What are these, my lord?”
5 And the angel answered and said to me,
“These are the four spirits of heaven,
going out after presenting themselves
before the Lord of all the earth.
6 The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country,
the white ones go after them,
and the dappled ones go toward the south country.”
7 When the strong horses came out,
they were impatient to go and patrol the earth.
And he said, “Go, patrol the earth.”
So they patrolled the earth.
8 Then he cried to me, “Behold, those who go toward the north country
have set My Spirit at rest in the north country.”


9 And the word of the LORD came to me:
10 “Take from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah,
who have arrived from Babylon,
and go the same day to the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah.
11 Take from them silver and gold, and make a crown,
and set it on the head of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
12 And say to him,
‘Thus says the LORD of hosts,
“Behold, the man whose name is the Branch:
for he shall branch out from his place,
and he shall build the temple of the LORD.
13 It is he who shall build the temple of the LORD
and shall bear royal honor,
and shall sit and rule on his throne.
And he shall be a priest on his throne,
and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.”’
14 And the crown shall be in the temple of the LORD
as a memorial to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah.
15 And those who are far off shall come
and help to build the temple of the LORD.
And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
And this shall come to pass,
if you will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.”




Chapter 7


1 And in the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.
2 Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men to entreat the favor of the LORD,
3 saying to the priests of the house of the LORD of hosts and the prophets, “Should I weep and abstain in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?”


4 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me:
5 “Say to all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth month and in the seventh, for these seventy years, was it for Me that you fasted?
6 And when you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves?
7 Were not these the words that the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, with her cities around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?’”


8 And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,
9 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another,
10 do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the sojourner, or the poor, and let none of you devise evil against another in your heart.
11 But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears that they might not hear.
12 They made their hearts diamond-hard lest they should hear the law and the words that the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.”


13 “As I called, and they would not hear,
so they called, and I would not hear,”
says the LORD of hosts,
14 “and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations
that they had not known.
Thus the land they left was desolate,
so that no one went to and fro,
and the pleasant land was made a desolation.”




Chapter 8


1 And the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,
2 “Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.
3 Thus says the LORD: I have returned to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain.”


4 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of great age.
5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.


6 Thus says the LORD of hosts: If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in My sight? declares the LORD of hosts.


7 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will save My people from the east country and from the west country,
8 and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness.


9 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Let your hands be strong, you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of the prophets, who were present on the day that the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD of hosts, that the temple might be built.
10 For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in, for I set every man against his neighbor.
11 But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, declares the LORD of hosts.
12 For there shall be a sowing of peace. The vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.
13 And as you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong.


14 For thus says the LORD of hosts: As I purposed to bring disaster to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the LORD of hosts,
15 so again have I purposed in these days to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear not.
16 These are the things that you shall do: Speak the truth to one another; render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace;
17 do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and love no false oath, for all these things I hate, declares the LORD.”


18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
19 “Thus says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah seasons of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.


20 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, even the inhabitants of many cities.
21 The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, ‘Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts; I myself am going.’
22 Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.


23 Thus says the LORD of hosts: In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, ‘Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’”




Chapter 9


1 The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, and Damascus is its resting place—for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward the LORD—
2 and also Hamath, which borders on it, Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.
3 Tyre has built herself a rampart and heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the mud of the streets.
4 But behold, the Lord will dispossess her and cast down her power into the sea, and she shall be devoured by fire.


5 Ashkelon shall see it and be afraid; Gaza too, and shall writhe in anguish; Ekron also, because its hope has withered. The king shall perish from Gaza; Ashkelon shall be uninhabited.
6 A mixed people shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of Philistia.
7 I will take away its blood from its mouth and its abominations from between its teeth; it too shall be a remnant for our God; it shall be like a clan in Judah, and Ekron shall be like the Jebusites
8 Then I will encamp at My house as a guard, so that none shall march to and fro; no oppressor shall again overrun them, for now I see with My own eyes.


9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!
Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem!
Behold, your king is coming to you;
He is righteous and having salvation,
humble and mounted on a donkey,
on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim
and the war horse from Jerusalem;
and the battle bow shall be cut off,
and he shall speak peace to the nations;
his rule shall be from sea to sea,
and from the River to the ends of the earth.


11 As for you also, because of the blood of your covenant,I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.
12 Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore to you double.
13 For I have bent Judah as My bow; I have made Ephraim its arrow. I will stir up. your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and wield you like a warrior’s sword. 14 Then the LORD will appear over them, and His arrow will go forth like lightning; the Lord GOD will sound the trumpet and will march forth in the whirlwinds of the south.
15 The LORD of hosts will protect them, and they shall devour and tread down the sling stones, and they shall drink and roar as if drunk with wine, and be full like a bowl, drenched like the corners of the altar.


16 On that day the LORD their God will save them as the flock of His people; for like the jewels of a crown they shall shine on His land.
17 For how great is His goodness, and how great His beauty! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the young women.




Chapter 10


1 Ask rain from the LORD in the season of the spring rain,
from the LORD who makes the storm clouds,
and He will give them showers of rain,
to everyone the vegetation in the field.
2 For the household gods utter nonsense,
and the diviners see lies;
they tell false dreams and give empty consolation.
Therefore the people wander like sheep;
they are afflicted for lack of a shepherd.
3 My anger is hot against the shepherds,
and I will punish the leaders;
for the LORD of hosts cares for His flock, the house of Judah,
and will make them like His majestic steed in battle.
4 From him shall come the cornerstone,
from him the tent peg,
from him the battle bow,
from him every ruler—all of them together.
5 They shall be like mighty men in battle,
trampling the foe in the mud of the streets;
they shall fight because the LORD is with them,
and they shall put to shame the riders on horses.
6 I will strengthen the house of Judah,
and I will save the house of Joseph.
I will bring them back
because I have compassion on them,
and they shall be as though I had not rejected them,
for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.
7 Then Ephraim shall become like a mighty warrior,
and their hearts shall be glad as with wine.
Their children shall see it and be glad;
their hearts shall rejoice in the LORD.
8 I will whistle for them and gather them in,
for I have redeemed them,
and they shall be as many as they were before.
9 Though I scattered them among the nations,
yet in far countries they shall remember Me,
and with their children they shall live and return.
10 I will bring them home from the land of Egypt
and gather them from Assyria,
and I will bring them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon,
till there is no room for them.
11 He shall pass through the sea of troubles
and strike down the waves of the sea,
and all the depths of the Nile shall be dried up.
The pride of Assyria shall be laid low,
and the scepter of Egypt shall depart.
12 I will make them strong in the LORD,
and they shall walk in His name,
declares the LORD.




Chapter 11


1 Open your doors, O Lebanon,
that fire may devour your cedars!
2 Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen,
for the glorious trees are ruined!
Wail, oaks of Bashan,
for the thick forest has been felled!
3 The sound of the wail of the shepherds,
for their glory is ruined!
The sound of the roar of the lions,
for the thicket of the Jordan is laid waste!


4 Thus said the LORD my God: “Shepherd the flock doomed to slaughter.
5 Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished,
and those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the LORD, I have become rich,’
and their own shepherds have no pity on them.
6 For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land,” declares the LORD.
“Behold, I will cause each of them to fall into the hand of his neighbor,
and into the hand of his king;
they shall crush the land,
and I will deliver none from their hand.”


7 So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders.
And I took two staffs; one I named Favor, the other I named Union.
And I shepherded the flock.
8 In one month I destroyed the three shepherds.
But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me.
9 So I said, “I will not shepherd you.
What is to die, let it die.
What is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed,
and let those who are left devour the flesh of one another.”


10 And I took my staff Favor, and I broke it,
annulling the covenant that I had made with all the peoples.
11 So it was annulled on that day,
and the sheep traders, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the LORD.


12 Then I said to them, “If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.”
And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver.
13 Then the LORD said to me,
“Throw it to the potter”—
the handsome price at which I was priced by them.
So I took the thirty pieces of silver
and threw them into the house of the LORD, to the potter.


14 Then I broke my second staff Union,
annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
15 Then the LORD said to me,
“Take once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
16 For behold, I am raising up in the land
a shepherd who does not care for those being destroyed,
or seek the young,
or heal the maimed, or nourish the healthy,
but devours the flesh of the fat ones,
tearing off even their hoofs.
17 Woe to the worthless shepherd
who deserts the flock!
May the sword strike his arm
and his right eye!
Let his arm be wholly withered,
his right eye utterly blinded!”




Chapter 12


1 The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel:


Thus declares the LORD,
who stretches out the heavens
and lays the foundation of the earth
and forms the spirit of man within him:
2 “Behold, I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of staggering
to all the surrounding peoples.
The siege of Jerusalem
will also be against Judah.
3 On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples.
All who lift it will surely hurt themselves,
and all the nations of the earth will gather against it.
4 On that day,” declares the LORD,
“I will strike every horse with panic,
and its rider with madness.
But for the house of Judah I will keep my eyes open,
when I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.
5 Then the clans of Judah shall say to themselves,
‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are our strength
through the LORD of hosts, their God.’
6 On that day I will make the clans of Judah
like a blazing pot in the midst of wood,
like a flaming torch among sheaves.
They shall devour to the right and to the left
all the surrounding peoples,
while Jerusalem shall again be inhabited in its place, in Jerusalem.
7 And the LORD will give salvation to the tents of Judah first,
that the glory of the house of David
and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem
may not surpass that of Judah.
8 On that day the LORD will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
so that the feeblest among them on that day shall be like David,
and the house of David shall be like God,
like the angel of the LORD going before them.
9 And on that day I will seek to destroy
all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
10 And I will pour out on the house of David
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
a spirit of grace and supplication,
so that, when they look on Me, on Him whom they have pierced,
they shall mourn for Him,
as one mourns for an only son,
and weep bitterly over Him,
as one weeps over a firstborn.
11 On that day the mourning in Jerusalem
will be as great as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon
in the plain of Megiddo.
12 The land shall mourn, each family by itself:
the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves;
the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;
13 the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves;
the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves;
14 and all the families that are left, each by itself,
and their wives by themselves.




Chapter 13


1 On that day there shall be a fountain opened
for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
to cleanse from sin and impurity.
2 And on that day, declares the LORD of hosts,
I will cut off the names of the idols from the land,
so that they shall be remembered no more.
And also I will remove from the land the prophets
and the spirit of uncleanness.
3 And if anyone still prophesies,
his father and mother who bore him shall say to him,
‘You shall not live,
for you speak lies in the name of the LORD.’
And his father and mother who bore him
shall pierce him through when he prophesies.
4 On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his vision
when he prophesies.
He will not put on a hairy cloak in order to deceive,
5 but he will say,
‘I am no prophet,
I am a tiller of the soil,
for a man sold me in my youth.’
6 And if one asks him, ‘What are these wounds on your back?’
he will say,
‘The wounds I received in the house of my friends.’


7 Awake, O sword, against My shepherd,
against the man who stands next to Me,
declares the LORD of hosts.
Strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered;
I will turn My hand against the little ones.
8 In the whole land, declares the LORD,
two-thirds shall be cut off and perish,
and one-third shall be left alive.
9 And I will put this third into the fire,
and refine them as one refines silver,
and test them as gold is tested.
They will call upon My name, and I will answer them.
I will say, ‘They are My people’;
and they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’




Chapter 14


1 Behold, a day is coming for the LORD
when the spoil taken from you will be divided in your midst.
2 For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle,
and the city shall be taken
and the houses plundered
and the women raped.
Half of the city shall go out into exile,
but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
3 Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations
as when He fights on a day of battle.
4 On that day His feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives
that lies before Jerusalem on the east,
and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west
by a very wide valley,
so that one half of the mountain shall move northward,
and the other half southward.
5 And you shall flee to the valley of My mountains,
for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal.
And you shall flee as you fled from the earthquake
in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.
Then the LORD my God will come,
and all the holy ones with Him.
6 On that day there shall be no light,
the luminaries will dwindle.
7 It shall be a unique day,
which is known to the LORD,
neither day nor night,
but at evening time there shall be light.
8 On that day living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem,
half of them to the eastern sea
and half of them to the western sea.
It shall continue in summer as in winter.
9 And the LORD will be king over all the earth.
On that day the LORD will be one
and His name one.
10 The whole land shall be turned into a plain
from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem.
But Jerusalem shall remain aloft on its site
from the Gate of Benjamin
to the place of the former gate, to the Corner Gate,
and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses.
11 And it shall be inhabited,
for there shall never again be a decree of utter destruction.
Jerusalem shall dwell in security.
12 And this shall be the plague
with which the LORD will strike all the peoples
that wage war against Jerusalem:
their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet,
their eyes will rot in their sockets,
and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
13 And on that day a great panic from the LORD shall fall on them,
so that each will seize the hand of another,
and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of the other.
14 Even Judah will fight at Jerusalem.
And the wealth of all the surrounding nations shall be collected,
gold, silver, and garments in great abundance.
15 And a plague like this plague
shall fall on the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys,
and whatever beasts may be in those camps.


16 Then everyone who survives
of all the nations that came against Jerusalem
shall go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts,
and to keep the Feast of Booths.
17 And if any of the families of the earth
do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts,
there will be no rain on them.
18 And if the family of Egypt does not go up and enter in,
then on them shall come the plague
with which the LORD afflicts the nations
that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths.
19 This shall be the punishment to Egypt
and the punishment to all the nations
that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths.
20 And on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses,
“Holy to the LORD.”
And the pots in the house of the LORD
shall be as the bowls before the altar.
21 And every pot in Jerusalem and Judah
shall be holy to the LORD of hosts,
so that all who sacrifice may come and take of them
and boil the meat of the sacrifice in them.
And there shall no longer be a trader
in the house of the LORD of hosts on that day.﻿Malachi


Chapter 1


1 The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel by the hand of Malachi.
2 “I have loved you,” says the LORD.
But you say, “How have You loved us?”
“Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the LORD.
“Yet I loved Jacob,
3 but Esau I hated.
I made his mountains a desolation
and gave his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.”
4 If Edom says, “We are shattered,
but we will rebuild the ruins,”
thus says the LORD of hosts:
“They may build, but I will tear down,
and they will be called ‘The Wicked Territory,’
and ‘The people with whom the LORD is angry forever.’”
5 Your eyes shall see this, and you shall say,
“Great is the LORD beyond the border of Israel!”


6 A son honors his father,
and a servant, his master.
If then I am a father, where is My honor?
And if I am a master, where is My fear?
says the LORD of hosts to you,
O priests who despise My name.
But you say, “How have we despised Your name?”
7 You offer defiled food on My altar.
But you say, “How have we defiled You?”
By saying that the table of the LORD is to be despised.
8 When you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?
And when you present the lame and the sick, is it not evil?
Bring it now to your governor—will he be pleased with you
or show you favor? says the LORD of hosts.


9 And now, entreat the favor of God, that He may be gracious to us.
With such a gift from your hand,
will He show favor to any of you? says the LORD of hosts.


10 Oh that there were one among you
who would shut the doors,
that you might not kindle fire on My altar in vain!
I have no pleasure in you, says the LORD of hosts,
and I will not accept an offering from your hand.


11 For from the rising of the sun to its setting,
My name will be great among the nations,
and in every place incense is offered to My name,
and a pure offering.
For My name will be great among the nations,
says the LORD of hosts.


12 But you profane it when you say,
“The table of the LORD is defiled,
and its fruit—that is, its food—is to be despised.”


13 But you say, “Look, what a weariness this is,”
and you sniff at it, says the LORD of hosts.
You bring what has been taken by violence,
or is lame or sick—
and this you bring as an offering!
Shall I accept this from your hand? says the LORD.
14 Cursed be the deceiver who has a male in his flock,
and vows it, yet sacrifices to the LORD what is blemished.
For I am a great King, says the LORD of hosts,
and My name will be feared among the nations.




Chapter 2


1 And now, O priests, this command is for you.
2 If you will not listen,
if you will not lay it to heart to give honor to My name,
says the LORD of hosts,
then I will send the curse upon you,
and I will curse your blessings;
indeed, I have already cursed them,
because you do not lay it to heart.
3 See, I will rebuke your offspring,
and spread dung on your faces,
the dung of your festival offerings,
and you shall be taken away with it.


4 So you shall know that I have sent this command to you,
that My covenant with Levi may stand,
says the LORD of hosts.
5 My covenant with him was one of life and peace,
and I gave them to him for fear,
and he feared Me;
he stood in awe of My name.
6 True instruction was in his mouth,
and no injustice was found on his lips.
He walked with Me in peace and uprightness,
and he turned many from iniquity.
7 For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge,
and men should seek instruction from his mouth,
for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.


8 But you have turned aside from the way;
you have caused many to stumble by your instruction.
You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,
says the LORD of hosts.
9 So I make you despised and low
before all the people,
inasmuch as you do not keep My ways
but show partiality in your instruction.
10 Have we not all one father?
Has not one God created us?
Why then are we faithless to one another,
profaning the covenant of our fathers?
11 Judah has been faithless,
and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem.
For Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which He loves,
and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
12 May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob
any man who does this,
who brings an offering to the LORD of hosts.


13 And this second thing you do:
You cover the altar of the LORD with tears,
with weeping and groaning
because He no longer regards the offering
or accepts it with favor from your hand.
14 But you say, “Why doesn't He?”
Because the LORD was witness between you and the wife of your youth,
to whom you have been faithless,
though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
15 Did He not make them one,
with a portion of the Spirit in their union?
And what was the one God seeking?
Godly offspring.
So guard yourselves in your spirit,
and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth.
16 “For I hate divorce,” says the LORD, the God of Israel,
“and him who covers his garment with violence,”
says the LORD of hosts.
So guard yourselves in your spirit,
and do not be faithless.


17 You have wearied the LORD with your words.
But you say, “How have we wearied Him?”
By saying, “Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD,
and He delights in them,”
or by asking, “Where is the God of justice?”




Chapter 3


1 Behold, I am sending My messenger,
and he will prepare the way before Me.
And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple;
and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight,
behold, He is coming,
says the LORD of hosts.
2 But who can endure the day of His coming,
and who can stand when He appears?
For He is like a refiner’s fire
and like fullers’ soap.
3 He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver,
and He will purify the sons of Levi
and refine them like gold and silver,
and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the LORD.
4 Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD
as in the days of old and as in former years.
5 Then I will draw near to you for judgment.
I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers,
against the adulterers,
against those who swear falsely,
against those who oppress the hired worker in his wages,
the widow and the orphan,
against those who turn aside the foreigner and do not fear Me,
says the LORD of hosts.
6 For I, the LORD, do not change;
therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.


7 From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes
and have not kept them.
Return to Me, and I will return to you,
says the LORD of hosts.
But you say, “How shall we return?”
8 Will a man rob God?
Yet you are robbing Me.
But you say, “How have we robbed You?”
In tithes and offerings.
9 You are cursed with a curse,
for you are robbing Me,
the whole nation of you.
10 Bring the full tithe into the storehouse,
that there may be food in My house.
And test Me now in this,
says the LORD of hosts,
if I will not open the windows of heaven for you
and pour down for you a blessing
until there is no more need.
11 I will rebuke the devourer for you,
so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil,
and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear,
says the LORD of hosts.
12 Then all the nations will call you blessed,
for you will be a land of delight,
says the LORD of hosts.


13 Your words have been harsh against Me,
says the LORD.
But you say, “What have we spoken against You?”
14 You have said, “It is vain to serve God.
What is the profit of our keeping His charge
or of walking as mourners before the LORD of hosts?
15 And now we call the arrogant blessed.
Evildoers not only prosper
but they put God to the test and they escape.”
16 Then those who feared the LORD spoke with one another.
The LORD paid attention and heard them,
and a book of remembrance was written before Him
of those who feared the LORD and esteemed His name.
17 “They shall be Mine,” says the LORD of hosts,
“in the day when I make up My treasured possession,
and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.
18 Then once more you shall see the distinction
between the righteous and the wicked,
between one who serves God
and one who does not serve Him.”




Chapter 4


1 For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven,
when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble.
The day that is coming shall set them ablaze,
says the LORD of hosts,
so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.
2 But for you who fear My name,
the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings.
You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall.
3 And you shall tread down the wicked,
for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet
on the day when I act,
says the LORD of hosts.


4 Remember the law of My servant Moses,
the statutes and judgments that I commanded him at Horeb
for all Israel.
5 Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet
before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes.
6 And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the sons,
and the hearts of the sons to their fathers,
lest I come and strike the land
with a decree of utter destruction.﻿The Gospel of Matthew


Chapter 1


1 The record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
2 Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers,
3 and Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram,
4 and Ram fathered Amminadab, and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,
5 and Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse,
6 and Jesse fathered David the king. And David fathered Solomon by the wife of Uriah,
7 and Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa,
8 and Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, and Joram fathered Uzziah,
9 and Uzziah fathered Jotham, and Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,
10 and Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, and Manasseh fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah,
11 and Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.
12 And after the exile to Babylon, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel,
13 and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, and Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor,
14 and Azor fathered Zadok, and Zadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud,
15 and Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob,
16 and Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
17 Thus, all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the exile to Babylon were fourteen generations, and from the exile to Babylon to the Christ were fourteen generations.


18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
19 And Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her publicly, intended to divorce her quietly.
20 But as he was considering these thingsit happened that an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
21 She will give birth to a son, and you shall name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”
22 All this happened to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet:
23 “Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call his name Immanuel,” which translated means “God with us.”
24 When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife,
25 but he did not know her intimately until she gave birth to a son. And he named him Jesus.




Chapter 2


1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea during the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
2 saying, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”
3 When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
4 And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them where the Christ was to be born.
5 They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it has been written by the prophet:
6 ‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’”
7 Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and determined from them the exact time the star appeared.
8 And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you find him, report back to me so that I too may go and worship him.”
9 After hearing the king, they departed, and behold, the star that they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
11 And entering the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother, and falling down, they worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
12 And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their own country by another route.
13 Now after they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him.”
14 So he got up, took the child and his mother by night, and departed for Egypt,
15 and he remained there until the death of Herod, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”
16 Then Herod, seeing that he had been deceived by the wise men, became furiously angry, and he sent out orders and put to death all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its surrounding regions who were two years old and under, according to the time he had determined from the wise men.
17 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
18 “A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.”
19 But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
20 saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the child’s life are dead.”
21 So he got up, took the child and his mother, and went into the land of Israel.
22 But hearing that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee,
23 and he came and settled in a town called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.




Chapter 3


1 In those days, John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
2 saying, “Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven has come!”
3 This is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.’”
4 Now John himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
5 Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and the whole region around the Jordan went out to him,
6 and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.


7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
8 Produce fruit worthy of repentance,
9 and do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
10 Even now the axe is laid at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.


11 I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly clean his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”


13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
14 But John tried to prevent him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?”
15 Jesus answered and said to him, “Permit it now, for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed him.
16 After Jesus was baptized, he immediately went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him.
17 And behold, a voice from the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”




Chapter 4


1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
2 And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.
3 And the tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.”
4 But he answered and said, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”


5 Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
6 and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and, ‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”
7 Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”


8 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,
9 and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”
10 Then Jesus said to him, “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.’”
11 Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.


12 Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.
13 And leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali,
14 so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
15 “The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—
16 the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and the shadow of death, on them a light has dawned.”


17 From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”


18 While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
19 And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
20 Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
21 And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.
22 Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.


23 And he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
24 So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, those having seizures, and paralytics, and he healed them.
25 And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.




Chapter 5


1 When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain, sat down, and his disciples came to him.
2 Then he began to teach them, saying:


3 “Blessed are those who know they’re spiritually bankrupt, because the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
4 Blessed are those who mourn, because they’ll be comforted.
5 Blessed are the humble, because they’ll inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are those who crave righteousness like they’re starving for it, because they’ll be satisfied.
7 Blessed are the merciful, because they’ll receive mercy.
8 Blessed are those with pure hearts, because they’ll see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers, because they’ll be called God’s children.
10 Blessed are those who are persecuted for doing what’s right, because the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
11 Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and spread vicious lies about you because of me.
12 Celebrate and be glad, because your reward in heaven is huge—after all, they persecuted the prophets before you the same way.”


13 “You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again? It’s useless—only good for being thrown out and trampled underfoot.
14 You are the light of the world. A city on a hill can’t be hidden.
15 Nobody lights a lamp and sticks it under a basket; they put it on a stand so it lights up the whole room.
16 In the same way, let your light shine in front of everyone, so they can see the good you do and give praise to your Father in heaven.”


17 “Do not think that I came to annul the Law or the Prophets—I didn’t come to set them aside but to reveal their true meaning.
18 I’m telling you the truth: until heaven and earth disappear, not a single dot or stroke of the Law will vanish until everything has been accomplished.
19 So, whoever ignores even the smallest commandment and teaches others to do the same will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever follows them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
20 Let me put it this way: unless your righteousness goes way beyond that of the religious scholars and Pharisees, you won’t even get into the kingdom of heaven.”


21 “You’ve heard it said to people back in the day, ‘Don’t murder,’ and ‘Whoever murders will face judgment.’
22 But I’m telling you, anyone who’s angry with their brother or sister will face judgment too. If you call someone an idiot, you’re in danger of judgment; if you curse them as worthless, you’re risking the fires of hell.
23 So, if you’re offering your gift at the altar and suddenly remember your brother or sister has something against you,
24 leave your gift there in front of the altar. Go, make things right with them first, then come back and offer your gift.
25 Settle things quickly with your accuser while you’re still on the way to court, or they might hand you over to the judge, the judge to the guard, and you’ll end up in prison.
26 I’m telling you, you won’t get out until you’ve paid every last penny.”


27 “You’ve heard it said, ‘Don’t commit adultery.’
28 But I’m telling you, anyone who looks at someone with lust has already committed adultery with them in their heart.
29 If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away—it’s better to lose one part of your body than for your corpse to be thrown undamaged into hell.
30 And if your right hand leads you into sin, cut it off and toss it—better to lose a piece of yourself than for your corpse to go undamaged into hell.”


31 “It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife should give her a certificate of divorce.’
32 But I’m telling you, anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery too.”


33 “You’ve also heard it said to people long ago, ‘Don’t break your oaths, but keep the promises you make to the Lord.’
34 But I’m telling you, don’t swear oaths at all—not by heaven, because it’s God’s throne;
35 not by the earth, because it’s his footstool; not by Jerusalem, because it’s the city of the great King.
36 Don’t even swear by your own head, because you can’t make a single hair white or black.
37 Just let your ‘yes’ mean yes and your ‘no’ mean no—anything more than that comes from sinfulness.”


38 “You’ve heard it said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’
39 But I’m telling you, don’t resist an evil person. If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn and offer the other one too.
40 If someone sues you for your shirt, give them your coat as well.
41 If someone forces you to go one mile, go two miles with them.
42 Give to the person who asks you, and don’t turn away someone who wants to borrow from you.”


43 “You’ve heard it said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
44 But I’m telling you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
45 so you can be children of your Father in heaven. He makes the sun rise on the evil and the good alike and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
46 If you only love those who love you, what reward do you get? Don’t even tax collectors do that?
47 And if you only greet your own people, what’s so special about that? Don’t even pagans do the same?
48 So be even-handed, just like your Father in heaven is even-handed.”




Chapter 6


1 "Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
2 So when you give to the needy, don’t announce it with trumpets like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be praised by people. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
3 But when you give to the needy, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.


5 And when you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
6 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
7 And when you pray, don’t keep babbling like the pagans, for they think they’ll be heard because of their many words.
8 Don’t be like them, because your Father knows what you need before you ask him.


9 This, then, is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be honored as holy,
10 may your kingdom come, may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
11 Give us today our daily bread,
12 and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
13 And don’t lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’


14 For if you forgive others their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
15 But if you don’t forgive others, your Father will not forgive your offenses.


16 When you fast, don’t look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
17 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,
18 so that it won’t be obvious to others that you’re fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.


19 Don’t store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
20 Instead, store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves don’t break in and steal.
21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.


22 The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
23 But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If, then, the light within you is darkness, that darkness is great indeed!


24 No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.


25 Therefore, I tell you, don’t worry about your life—what you will eat or drink—or about your body, or what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food, and the body more than clothes?
26 Look at the birds of the air: they don’t sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you much more valuable than they are?
27 Can any one of you, by worrying, add a single hour to your life?


28 And why do you worry about clothes? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they don’t labor or spin.
29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
30 If that’s how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, won’t he much more clothe you—you of little faith?


31 So don’t worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’
32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
34 Therefore, don’t worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."




Chapter 7


1 "Don’t judge others, so that you won’t be judged.
2 For the way you judge others is how you’ll be judged, and the standard you use to measure them will be used to measure you.
3 Why do you focus on the speck in your brother’s eye but ignore the plank in your own eye?
4 How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take that speck out of your eye,’ when there’s a plank in your own eye?
5 You hypocrite! First, take the plank out of your own eye, and then you’ll see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
6 Don’t give what is holy to dogs, and don’t throw your pearls in front of pigs, or they’ll trample them underfoot and turn around to attack you."


7 "Keep asking, and it will be given to you; keep seeking, and you’ll find; keep knocking, and the door will be opened to you.
8 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
9 Which one of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
10 Or if he asks for a fish, will you give him a snake?
11 If you, then, even though you’re flawed, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?"


12 "So, in everything, treat others the way you want them to treat you, because this sums up the Law and the Prophets."


13 "Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the road is spacious that leads to destruction, and many people go through it.
14 But the gate is narrow and the road is tight that leads to life, and only a few find it."


15 "Watch out for false prophets who come to you dressed as sheep but inside are vicious wolves.
16 You’ll recognize them by their actions. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?
17 In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a rotten tree produces bad fruit.
18 A good tree can’t produce bad fruit, nor can a rotten tree produce good fruit.
19 Every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit gets cut down and thrown into the fire.
20 So, you’ll know people by their fruit."


21 "Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
22 On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, drive out demons in your name, and do lots of miracles in your name?’
23 Then I’ll tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who practice disobedience to the law.’"


24 "So, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
25 The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, but it didn’t collapse because its foundation was on the rock.
26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and doesn’t put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
27 The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it collapsed—and its fall was devastating."


28 When Jesus finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,
29 because he taught them with authority, not like their scribes.




Chapter 8


1 When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.
2 Suddenly, a man with leprosy approached, knelt before him, and said, "Lord, if you’re willing, you can make me clean."
3 Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said, "I am willing; be clean." Immediately, his leprosy was cured.
4 Then Jesus said to him, "Make sure you don’t tell anyone about this. Instead, go show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."


5 As Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, pleading,
6 "Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, suffering terribly."
7 Jesus responded, "I will come and heal him."
8 But the centurion replied, "Lord, I’m not worthy to have you come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
9 For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it."
10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, "Truly, I tell you, I haven’t found faith this great anywhere in Israel.
11 I say to you, many will come from east and west and recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,
12 but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; let it be done for you as you have believed." And at that very moment, his servant was healed.


14 When Jesus arrived at Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
15 He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
16 That evening, people brought to him many who were demon-possessed. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick,
17 fulfilling what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "He took our infirmities and carried our diseases."


18 Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake.
19 A scribe approached and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
20 Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
21 Another of his disciples said, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
22 But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."


23 Then he got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
24 Suddenly, a fierce storm hit the lake, so severe that the waves were crashing over the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
25 The disciples went to him and woke him, shouting, "Lord, save us! We’re going to die!"
26 He said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then he stood up, rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
27 The men were astonished and said, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!"


28 When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
29 They shouted, "What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"
30 Now a large herd of pigs was feeding at some distance from them.
31 The demons begged him, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
32 He said to them, "Go." So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned in the water.
33 The herdsmen fled, went into the town, and reported everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
34 Then the whole town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.




Chapter 9


1 Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over, and came to his own town.
2 Some people brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.”
3 At this, some of the religious teachers said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!”
4 Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, “Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?
5 Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?
6 But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—” then he said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, take your mat, and go home.”
7 And the man got up and went home.
8 When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe and praised God, who had given such authority to human beings.


9 As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he said to him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
10 While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.
11 When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
12 On hearing this, Jesus said, “It’s not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
13 Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I haven’t come to call the righteous, but sinners.”


14 Then John’s disciples came to him and asked, “Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?”
15 Jesus answered, “Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.
16 No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, because the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.
17 Nor do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”


18 While he was saying these things to them, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and place your hand on her, and she will live.”
19 Jesus got up and followed him, along with his disciples.
20 Just then, a woman who had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.
21 She said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I’ll be healed.”
22 Jesus turned, saw her, and said, “Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you.” And from that moment, the woman was healed.


23 When Jesus entered the synagogue leader’s house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd,
24 he said, “Go away. The girl isn’t dead but asleep.” And they laughed at him.
25 After the crowd had been put outside, he went in, took her by the hand, and the girl got up.
26 News of this spread throughout that region.


27 As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
28 When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus asked them, “Do you believe that I’m able to do this?” “Yes, Lord,” they replied.
29 Then he touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith, let it be done for you.”
30 And their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, “See that no one knows about this.” 
31 But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.


32 As they were leaving, a demon-possessed man who couldn’t speak was brought to Jesus.
33 After the demon was driven out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.”
34 But the Pharisees said, “He drives out demons by the prince of demons.”


35 Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness.
36 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
38 Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.”




Chapter 10


1 Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and sickness.
2 Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one who later betrayed him.


5 These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, “Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any Samaritan town,
6 but go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
7 As you go, proclaim this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’
8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with skin diseases, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.
9 Do not take along gold, silver, or copper coins in your belts,
10 no bag for the journey, or an extra shirt, or sandals, or a staff—for the worker deserves his food.
11 Whenever you enter a town or village, find out who is worthy there and stay with them until you leave.
12 As you enter the house, greet it with peace.
13 If the house is worthy, let your peace rest on it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
14 And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or town.
15 Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.”


16 “Look, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
17 Be on guard against people, for they will hand you over to local councils and flog you in their synagogues.
18 You will be brought before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
19 But when they hand you over, don’t worry about how to speak or what to say. In that moment, what you should say will be given to you,
20 for it won’t be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.”


21 “Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.
22 You will be hated by everyone because of my name, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.
23 When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.”


24 “A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
25 It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they called the head of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household!”


26 “So don’t be afraid of them. Nothing is covered up that won’t be revealed, or hidden that won’t be made known.
27 What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; what you hear whispered, proclaim from the rooftops.
28 Don’t fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the mind. Rather, fear the one who can destroy both mind and body in hell.
29 Aren’t two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s knowledge.
30 Even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
31 So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.”


32 “Everyone who acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
33 But whoever denies me before others, I will also deny before my Father in heaven.”


34 “Don’t think I came to bring peace to the earth. I didn’t come to bring peace, but a sword.
35 For I came to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
36 A person’s enemies will be members of their own household.
37 Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
38 And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
39 Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.”


40 “Whoever welcomes you, welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes the one who sent me.
41 Whoever welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person because he is righteous will receive a righteous person’s reward.
42 And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple—truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.”




Chapter 11


1 After Jesus finished instructing his twelve disciples, he left that place to teach and preach in the towns of the region.


2 Now, when John, who was in prison, heard about the works of the Messiah, he sent his disciples
3 to ask Jesus, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”
4 Jesus replied, “Go back and report to John what you hear and see:
5 The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, those with skin diseases are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news preached to them.
6 And blessed is anyone who does not stumble because of me.”


7 As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
8 No? Then what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who wear fine clothes are in kings’ palaces.
9 So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
10 This is the one about whom it is written: ‘Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’
11 Truly I tell you, among those born of women, no one greater than John the Baptist has arisen. Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful people are seizing it.
13 For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
14 And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah, the one who was to come.
15 Whoever has ears, let them hear.


16 “To what can I compare this generation? It’s like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to their friends,
17 ‘We played the flute for you, and you didn’t dance; we sang a dirge, and you didn’t mourn.’
18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’
19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ Yet wisdom is proven right by her actions.”


20 Then Jesus began to denounce the towns where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.
21 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
22 But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
23 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
24 But I tell you, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”


25 At that time, Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children.
26 Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.
27 All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.


28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”




Chapter 12


1 At that time, Jesus was walking through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them.
2 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.”
3 But he replied to them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and those with him were hungry?
4 How he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him or his companions to eat, but only for the priests?
5 Or haven’t you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and yet are guiltless?
6 I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
7 If you had understood what this means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the innocent.
8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”


9 Moving on from there, he entered their synagogue.
10 There was a man with a withered hand, and they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”—intending to accuse him.
11 He said to them, “Which one of you, if you had a sheep that fell into a pit on the Sabbath, would not grab it and lift it out?
12 How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”
13 Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and it was restored, as healthy as the other.
14 But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, how they might destroy him.


15 Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from there. Many followed him, and he healed them all,
16 ordering them not to make him known.
17 This fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
18 “Here is my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
19 He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
20 A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not extinguish, until he brings justice to victory.
21 And in his name the nations will hope.”


22 Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw.
23 All the crowds were amazed and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”
24 But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man only casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.”
25 Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand.
26 If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself—how then will his kingdom stand?
27 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own people cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
28 But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
29 Or how can someone enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
30 Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
31 Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
32 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.”


33 “Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for a tree is known by its fruit.
34 You brood of vipers! How can you speak good things when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
35 The good person brings good things out of a good treasure, and the evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure.
36 I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give an account for every careless word they speak. 37 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”


38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees responded, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”
39 But he answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
40 For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
41 The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at Jonah’s preaching, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
42 The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.”


43 “When an unclean spirit leaves a person, it goes through waterless places seeking rest but does not find it.
44 Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when it arrives, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order.
45 Then it goes and brings with it other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person becomes worse than the first. So it will be with this evil generation.”


46 While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
47 Someone told him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.”
48 But he replied to the one who told him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
49 And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!
50 For Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”




Chapter 13


1 On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
2 Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat down, while the whole crowd stood on the shore.
3 He spoke to them at length in parables, saying, “Listen, a farmer went out to sow seed.
4 As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and ate them up.
5 Other seeds fell on rocky ground where they didn’t have much soil. They sprang up quickly because the soil wasn’t deep,
6 but when the sun came up, they were scorched, and since they had no root, they withered away.
7 Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
8 Still other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop—some a hundred times what was sown, some sixty, and some thirty.
9 Anyone who has ears should listen.”


10 Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”
11 He answered them, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.
12 For whoever has, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken away.
13 This is why I speak to them in parables: because seeing, they do not see, and hearing, they do not hear, nor do they understand.
14 In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says, ‘You will listen and listen but never understand; you will look and look but never perceive.
15 For this people’s heart has grown dull, their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and turn back, and I would heal them.’
16 But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
17 Truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”


18 “So listen to the parable of the sower.
19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
20 The seed sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,
21 but they have no root in themselves and only last for a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
22 The seed sown among the thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of this world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
23 But the seed sown on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces—some a hundred times, some sixty, some thirty.”


24 He presented another parable to them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
25 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away.
26 When the wheat sprouted and produced grain, the weeds also appeared.
27 The servants of the landowner came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where did these weeds come from?’
28 He replied, ‘An enemy did this.’ The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’
29 But he said, ‘No, because while you’re pulling up the weeds, you might uproot the wheat along with them.
30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At harvest time, I’ll tell the reapers, “First gather the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned, then gather the wheat into my barn.”’”


31 He offered them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.
32 It’s the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows, it becomes larger than the garden plants and turns into a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”


33 He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until it was all leavened.”


34 Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables; he didn’t speak to them without a parable,
35 so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled: “I will open my mouth in parables; I will declare things hidden since the foundation of the world.”


36 Then he left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
37 He answered, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
38 The field is the world, and the good seed represents the children of the kingdom. The weeds are the children of the evil one,
39 and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
40 Just as the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.
41 The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all lawbreakers,
42 and they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Anyone who has ears should listen.”


44 “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up again. Then in his joy, he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field.”


45 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.
46 When he found one pearl of great value, he went and sold everything he had and bought it.”


47 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea that caught fish of every kind.
48 When it was full, they pulled it ashore, sat down, and sorted the good fish into containers but threw the bad ones away.
49 That’s how it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come and separate the evil from the righteous
50 and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”


51 “Have you understood all these things?” he asked them. They said, “Yes.”
52 Then he said to them, “Therefore every scribe trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a homeowner who brings out of his storeroom new things and old.”


53 When Jesus had finished these parables, he left that place.
54 He came to his hometown and began teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were amazed and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?
55 Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother named Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
56 And his sisters, aren’t they all with us? So where did he get all these things?”
57 And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.”
58 And he didn’t do many miracles there because of their unbelief.




Chapter 14


1 At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus.
2 He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist! He’s been raised from the dead, and that’s why these miraculous powers are at work in him."
3 For Herod had seized John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
4 John had been telling him, "It’s not lawful for you to have her."
5 Although Herod wanted to kill John, he was afraid of the crowd, because they regarded him as a prophet. 


6 But when Herod’s birthday celebration came, the daughter of Herodias danced before everyone and pleased Herod.
7 So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked for.
8 Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter."
9 The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and the guests, he ordered it to be given to her.
10 He sent word and had John beheaded in the prison.
11 John’s head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who then brought it to her mother.
12 John’s disciples came, took the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.


13 When Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by himself. But when the crowds heard about it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
14 When he went ashore, he saw a large crowd, and he felt compassion for them and healed their sick.
15 As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This place is remote, and it’s getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
16 But Jesus said to them, "They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat."
17 They replied, "We only have five loaves of bread and two fish here."
18 He said, "Bring them to me."
19 Then he instructed the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, blessed them, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
20 Everyone ate and was satisfied. They picked up twelve baskets full of leftover pieces.
21 Those who ate numbered about five thousand men, not counting women and children.


22 Immediately afterward, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
23 After sending them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
24 Meanwhile, the boat was already far from land, battered by the waves, because the wind was against them.
25 During the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.
26 When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified and said, "It’s a ghost!" And they cried out in fear.
27 But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, "Take courage! It’s me. Don’t be afraid." 


28 Peter answered him, "Lord, if it’s you, command me to come to you on the water."
29 Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
30 But when he saw the strong wind, he became afraid, and as he began to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
31 Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
32 When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.
33 Those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly, you are the Son of God."


34 After they crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.
35 When the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word into the surrounding region, and people brought all who were sick to him.
36 They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.




Chapter 15


1 Then some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem approached Jesus, saying,
2 “Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”
3 He answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment for the sake of your tradition?
4 For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother,’ and, ‘Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.’
5 But you say, ‘If someone tells their father or mother, “Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift to God,”
6 then they don’t need to honor their parents.’ So, you nullify God’s word for the sake of your tradition.
7 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying,
8 ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;
9 they worship me in vain, teaching human rules as doctrines.’”


10 Then he called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand:
11 It’s not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth—this is what defiles a person.”
12 Then the disciples came to him and said, “Did you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”
13 He replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted.
14 Leave them alone; they’re blind guides. If a blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into a pit.”
15 Peter responded, “Explain this parable to us.”
16 Jesus said, “Are you still so slow to understand?
17 Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then passes out of the body?
18 But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and that’s what defiles a person.
19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.
20 These are what defile a person, but eating with unwashed hands doesn’t defile anyone.”


21 Jesus left that place and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
22 A Canaanite woman from that area came out and cried, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely tormented by a demon.”
23 But he didn’t answer her a word. His disciples came and urged him, saying, “Send her away, because she keeps shouting after us.”
24 He responded, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
25 But she came, knelt before him, and said, “Lord, help me!”
26 He replied, “It’s not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”
27 She said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”
28 Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed at that very moment.


29 Jesus moved on from there and came near the Sea of Galilee. He went up on a mountain and sat down.
30 Large crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
31 The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.


32 Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion for the crowd because they’ve been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry, or they might collapse on the way.”
33 The disciples said to him, “Where are we going to get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a large crowd?”
34 Jesus asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
35 He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
36 Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the crowd.
37 They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward, they collected seven baskets full of leftover pieces.
38 Those who ate numbered four thousand men, besides women and children.
39 After dismissing the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.




Chapter 16


1 The Pharisees and Sadducees approached Jesus, and to test him, they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
2 He responded to them, “When evening comes, you say, ‘It’ll be fair weather, because the sky is red.’
3 And in the morning, you say, ‘It’ll be stormy today, because the sky is red and threatening.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you can’t interpret the signs of the times.
4 An evil and adulterous generation demands a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” Then he left them and went away.


5 When the disciples crossed to the other side, they forgot to bring bread.
6 Jesus said to them, “Watch out and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
7 They started discussing among themselves, saying, “It’s because we didn’t bring any bread.”
8 Aware of this, Jesus said, “Why are you talking about not having bread, you of little faith?
9 Don’t you understand yet? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you collected?
10 Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you gathered?
11 How is it that you don’t realize I wasn’t talking about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
12 Then they understood that he wasn’t telling them to beware of the yeast in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.


13 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”
14 They replied, “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
15 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”
16 Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”
17 Jesus responded, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood didn’t reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven did.
18 And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.
19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”
20 Then he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.


21 From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised from the dead.
22 Peter took him aside and started to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This will never happen to you.”
23 But Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you’re not thinking about God’s concerns, but human ones.”


24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to follow me, let them deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me.
25 For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
26 What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world but forfeit their eternal salvation? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their salvation?
27 For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what they have done.
28 Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”




Chapter 17


1 After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, James’s brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
2 There, he was transformed in front of them: his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
3 Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
4 Peter spoke up and said to Jesus, “Lord, it’s good that we’re here. If you want, I’ll set up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
5 While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”
6 When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown, overwhelmed with fear.
7 But Jesus came over, touched them, and said, “Get up, and don’t be afraid.”
8 When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus alone.


9 As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, “Don’t tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”
10 The disciples asked him, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
11 Jesus answered, “Elijah does come, and he will restore everything.
12 But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they didn’t recognize him; instead, they did whatever they wanted to him. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”
13 Then the disciples understood that he was talking about John the Baptist.


14 When they reached the crowd, a man approached Jesus, knelt before him,
15 and said, “Lord, have mercy on my son! He has seizures and suffers terribly—he often falls into the fire or into water.
16 I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn’t heal him.”
17 Jesus responded, “You faithless and perverse generation, how long will I have to stay with you? How long will I have to put up with you? Bring him here to me.”
18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed from that moment.


19 Later, the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”
20 He said to them, “Because of your little faith. Truly, I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”


21 [Omitted. Not in the earliest and most reliable manuscripts.]


22 While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be handed over into the hands of men,
23 and they will kill him, but on the third day he will be raised from the dead.” And they were deeply grieved.


24 When they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax came to Peter and asked, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the tax?”
25 He said, “Yes.” But when he went into the house, Jesus spoke first, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tolls or taxes—from their own sons or from others?”
26 Peter answered, “From others.” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are exempt.
27 But so that we don’t offend them, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take the first fish you catch. When you open its mouth, you’ll find a coin worth four drachmas. Take it and give it to them for me and you.”




Chapter 18


1 At that moment, the disciples approached Jesus and asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
2 He called a child over, placed them in the middle of the group,
3 and said, “I’m telling you the truth: unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
4 So, whoever humbles themselves like this child—such a one is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
5 And whoever welcomes one child like this in my name, welcomes me.”


6 “But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.
7 Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must happen, but woe to the person through whom they come!
8 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It’s better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
9 And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It’s better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.”


10 “Make sure you don’t look down on one of these little ones, because I’m telling you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
11 [Omitted. Not in the earliest and most reliable manuscripts.]
12 What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders off, won’t he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go search for the one that’s lost?
13 And if he finds it, I assure you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that didn’t wander off.
14 In the same way, it’s not the will of your Father in heaven that even one of these little ones should perish.”


15 “If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you’ve won them over.
16 But if they don’t listen, take one or two others along with you, so that every matter can be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
17 If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church. And if they won’t listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
18 I’m telling you the truth: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
19 Again, I assure you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
20 For where two or three gather in my name, there I am with them.”


21 Then Peter came up to him and said, “Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”
22 Jesus answered, “I tell you: not up to seven times, but up to seventy-seven times.”


23 “Because of this, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
24 As he began the process, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.
25 Since he couldn’t pay, the master ordered that he, his wife, his children, and everything he owned would be sold to repay the debt.
26 At this, the servant fell on his knees before him and said, ‘Be patient with me, and I’ll repay you everything.’
27 The master, moved with compassion, released him and forgave the debt.
28 But when that servant left, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began choking him, saying, ‘Pay me back what you owe!’
29 His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged, ‘Be patient with me, and I’ll pay you back.’
30 But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could repay the debt.
31 When the other servants saw what had happened, they were deeply distressed and went to their master to report everything that had taken place.
32 Then the master called the servant in and said, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
33 Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?’
34 In anger, his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured until he could pay back everything he owed.
35 This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”




Chapter 19


1 When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
2 Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.


3 Some Pharisees came to him, testing him, and asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
4 He answered them, “Haven’t you read that the one who made them from the beginning ‘made them male and female,’
5 and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’?
6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.”
7 They said to him, “Then why did Moses command us to give a certificate of divorce and send her away?”
8 Jesus replied, “Because of the hardness of your hearts, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives. However, it was not this way from the beginning.
9 Instead, I tell you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.”


10 The disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it’s better not to marry.”
11 But he said to them, “Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it has been given.
12 For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made that way by people, and there are eunuchs who made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to accept this accept it.”


13 Then little children were brought to him so that he might lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
14 Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and don’t stop them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”
15 And after laying his hands on them, he went on from there.


16 Now a man came up to him and said, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?”
17 Jesus said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”
18 He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus replied, “You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,
19 honor your father and mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
20 The young man said to him, “I’ve kept all these. What do I still lack?”
21 Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
22 But when the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions.


23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”
25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, “Then who can be saved?”
26 Jesus looked at them and said, “With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”


27 Then Peter responded, “Teacher, we’ve left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?”
28 Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, in the regenesis of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
30 But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”




Chapter 20


1 “The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
2 After agreeing with the workers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
3 Around nine o’clock, he went out again and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.
4 He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and I’ll pay you whatever is fair.’ So they went.
5 He went out again around noon and three o’clock and did the same thing.
6 Then about five o’clock, he went out and found others standing around. He asked them, ‘Why are you standing here all day with nothing to do?’
7 They answered, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He told them, ‘You go into the vineyard too.’


8 When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last ones hired and moving to the first.’
9 The ones who started at five o’clock came forward, and each received a denarius.
10 When the first ones hired came, they thought they’d get more, but they also received a denarius each.
11 After getting paid, they started grumbling against the landowner,
12 saying, ‘These guys who came last only worked one hour, and you made them equal to us who carried the load all day in the scorching heat!’
13 But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I’m not being unfair to you. Didn’t you agree to work for a denarius?
14 Take what’s yours and go. I want to give the last workers the same as I gave you.
15 Can’t I do what I want with my own money? Or are you jealous because I’m generous?’
16 So, the last will be first, and the first will be last.”


17 As Jesus was heading up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside privately and said to them on the way,
18 “Look, we’re going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes. They’ll condemn him to death
19 and turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, flogged, and crucified. But on the third day, he’ll be raised.”


20 Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons, kneeling before him to ask something.
21 He said to her, “What do you want?” She replied, “Promise that these two sons of mine will sit, one at your right and one at your left, in your kingdom.”
22 Jesus answered, “You don’t know what you’re asking. Can you drink the cup I’m about to drink?” They said to him, “We can.”
23 He told them, “You will indeed drink my cup, but sitting at my right or left isn’t mine to grant—it’s for those my Father has prepared it for.”


24 When the other ten disciples heard this, they got upset with the two brothers.
25 But Jesus called them over and said, “You know how the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over people, and their big shots exercise authority over them.
26 It’s not going to be like that with you. Instead, whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant,
27 and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave—
28 just like the Son of Man didn’t come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.”


29 As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
30 Two blind men were sitting by the road, and when they heard Jesus was passing by, they shouted, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
31 The crowd told them to be quiet, but they shouted even louder, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
32 Jesus stopped, called them over, and said, “What do you want me to do for you?”
33 They answered, “Lord, we want our eyes opened.”
34 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and right away they could see. Then they followed him.




Chapter 21


1 As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples ahead,
2 saying to them, "Go into the village right in front of you, and immediately you’ll find a donkey tied up with her colt next to her. Untie them and bring them to me.
3 If anyone says anything to you, just say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he’ll let them go right away."
4 This happened to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:
5 "Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Look, your king is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’"


6 The disciples went and did exactly as Jesus had instructed them.
7 They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.
8 A huge crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the path.
9 The crowds walking ahead of him and those following behind were shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"


10 When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, asking, "Who is this?"
11 The crowds answered, "This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee."


12 Jesus went into the temple and drove out all the people buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
13 He said to them, "It’s written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you’ve turned it into a den of robbers."


14 The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things he was doing and heard the children shouting in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were furious.
16 They said to him, "Do you hear what these kids are saying?" Jesus replied, "Yes, I do. Haven’t you ever read, ‘Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise’?"
17 Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.


18 Early the next morning, as he was heading back to the city, he got hungry.
19 Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And instantly, the fig tree withered.
20 When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither so fast?"
21 Jesus answered them, "I’m telling you the truth: if you have faith and don’t doubt, you’ll not only do what was done to this fig tree, but you could even say to this mountain, ‘Get up and throw yourself into the sea,’ and it would happen.
22 Whatever you ask for in prayer, if you believe, you’ll receive it."


23 When he entered the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people approached him while he was teaching and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
24 Jesus responded, "I’ll ask you one question too. If you answer me, I’ll tell you by what authority I’m doing these things:
25 Where did John’s baptism come from? Was it from heaven or of human origin?" They started discussing it among themselves, saying, "If we say ‘from heaven,’ he’ll ask us, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’
26 But if we say ‘of human origin,’ we’re afraid of the crowd, because they all consider John a prophet."
27 So they answered Jesus, "We don’t know." He said to them, "Then I’m not telling you by what authority I’m doing these things either."


28 "What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go work in the vineyard today.’
29 The son replied, ‘I don’t want to,’ but later he changed his mind and went.
30 The father went to the second son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I’ll go, sir,’ but he didn’t go.
31 Which of the two did what the father wanted?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "I’m telling you the truth: tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.
32 John came to you with the way of righteousness, and you didn’t believe him, but the tax collectors and prostitutes did. But even after you saw them, you srull didn’t change your minds and believe him."


33 "Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenants and went away on a trip.
34 When harvest time came, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit.
35 But the tenants grabbed his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
36 He sent another group of servants, larger than the first, and they did the same thing to them.
37 Finally, he sent his son to them, thinking, ‘They’ll respect my son.’
38 But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the heir. Come on, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.’
39 So they grabbed him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
40 Now, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?"
41 They answered, "He’ll destroy those wicked men completely and lease the vineyard to other tenants who’ll give him his share of the harvest at the right time."


42 Jesus said to them, "Haven’t you ever read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this is the Lord’s doing, and it’s incredible in our eyes’?
43 So I’m telling you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
44 Anyone who falls on this stone will be shattered, and if it falls on anyone, it will crush them."


45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew he was talking about them.
46 They wanted to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, who regarded him as a prophet.




Chapter 22


1 Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,
2 "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
3 He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding, but they didn’t want to come.
4 So he sent other servants, instructing them, ‘Tell those who were invited, “Look, I’ve prepared my dinner—my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’
5 But they ignored it and went off—one to his farm, another to his business.
6 The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.
7 The king was furious. He sent his troops, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.


8 Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited didn’t deserve it.
9 Go out to the street corners and invite anyone you find to the wedding.’
10 So the servants went out into the streets and gathered everyone they could find, both bad and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.


11 But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who wasn’t wearing wedding clothes.
12 He said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ The man was speechless.
13 Then the king told the attendants, ‘Tie him up hand and foot, and throw him out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
14 For many are invited, but few are chosen."


15 Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they could trap Jesus with his own words.
16 They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know you’re truthful and teach God’s way honestly. You don’t care about anyone’s opinion or show favoritism.
17 So tell us what you think: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
18 But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, "Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?
19 Show me the coin used for the tax." They brought him a denarius.
20 He asked them, "Whose image and inscription are on it?"
21 They answered, "Caesar’s." Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God."
22 When they heard this, they were amazed and left him, walking away.


23 That same day, some Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came to him and asked,
24 "Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies without children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.’
25 Now, there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
26 The same thing happened to the second and third, all the way to the seventh.
27 Finally, the woman died too.
28 So, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be out of the seven, since all of them had her?"
29 Jesus answered them, "You’re mistaken because you don’t know the Scriptures or the power of God.
30 In the resurrection, people neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels in heaven.
31 As for the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read what God said to you:
32 ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He isn’t the God of the dead, but of the living."
33 When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.


34 When the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
35 One of them, a lawyer, tested him with a question:
36 "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"
37 Jesus replied, "‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’
38 This is the first and greatest commandment.
39 The second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’
40 All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments."


41 While the Pharisees were still gathered, Jesus asked them,
42 "What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "David’s."
43 He replied, "Then why does David, speaking by the Spirit, call him ‘Lord,’ saying,
44 ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet”’?
45 If David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?"
46 No one could answer him a word, and from that day on, no one dared to question him anymore.




Chapter 23


1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,
2 saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees have taken their seat on the chair of Moses.
3 So, do everything they tell you and follow it, but don’t imitate their actions, because they say things and don’t do them.
4 They tie up heavy burdens and place them on people’s shoulders, but they themselves aren’t willing to lift a finger to move them.
5 Everything they do is for show, to be noticed by others. They make their phylacteries wide and their tassels long,
6 and they love the best seats at banquets and the front rows in the synagogues,
7 along with the greetings in the marketplaces and being called ‘Rabbi’ by people.


8 But you—don’t let yourselves be called ‘Rabbi,’ because you have one Teacher, and you’re all siblings.
9 Don’t call anyone on earth your ‘father,’ because you have one Father, the one in heaven.
10 And don’t be called ‘instructors,’ because you have one Instructor, the Messiah.
11 The greatest among you will be your servant.
12 Whoever exalts themselves will be humbled, and whoever humbles themselves will be exalted.


13 But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You don’t go in yourselves, and you don’t let those trying to enter do so either.
15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel across sea and land to make one convert, and when they become one, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.


16 Woe to you, blind guides! You say, ‘If someone swears by the temple, it’s nothing, but if someone swears by the gold of the temple, they’re bound by it.’
17 You blind fools! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy?
18 And you say, ‘If someone swears by the altar, it’s nothing, but if someone swears by the gift on it, they’re bound by it.’
19 You blind people! Which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy?
20 So, whoever swears by the altar swears by it and everything on it.
21 And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
22 And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by the one seated on it.


23 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You tithe mint, dill, and cumin, but you’ve neglected the weightier parts of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness. These you should’ve done without skipping the others.
24 You blind guides! You strain at a gnat but swallow a camel.


25 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they’re full of greed and self-indulgence.
26 Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup, so the outside can be clean too.


27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You’re like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but are full of dead people’s bones and all kinds of uncleanness inside.
28 In the same way, you appear righteous to people on the outside, but inside you’re full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.


29 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous,
30 saying, ‘If we’d lived in our ancestors’ days, we wouldn’t have joined them in shedding the prophets’ blood.’
31 So you testify against yourselves that you’re the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
32 Go ahead and fill up the measure of your ancestors’ guilt.


33 You snakes, you brood of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell?
34 Because of this, look, I’m sending you prophets, wise people, and scribes. Some of them you’ll kill and crucify, and some you’ll flog in your synagogues and chase from town to town,
35 so that all the righteous blood shed on earth will come upon you—from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
36 Truly, I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation.


37 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! How often I’ve wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you weren’t willing.
38 Look, your house is left to you desolate.
39 For I tell you, you won’t see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.’”




Chapter 24


1 Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to point out the buildings of the temple.
2 But he responded to them, “Do you see all these things? I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every single one will be thrown down.”


3 As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately and said, “Tell us: when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
4 Jesus answered them, “Watch out that no one deceives you.
5 For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and they will deceive many people.
6 You will hear about wars and rumors of wars. Make sure you’re not alarmed, because these things must take place, but the end is not yet.
7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
8 But all these are just the beginning of the birth pains.


9 "Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.
10 At that time, many will fall away, betray one another, and hate each other.
11 Many false prophets will appear and deceive a lot of people.
12 Because of the increase of lawlessness, the love of most will grow cold.
13 But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.


15 So when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
16 then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
17 The one on the housetop must not go down to take anything out of the house,
18 and the one in the field must not turn back to grab a cloak.
19 How terrible it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
20 Pray that your flight won’t happen in winter or on a Sabbath.
21 For at that time there will be great tribulation, unlike anything that has happened from the beginning of the world until now, and never to be equaled again.
22 If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened.


23 At that time, if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or ‘There he is!’ don’t believe it.
24 For false messiahs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
25 See, I’ve told you ahead of time.
26 So if they say to you, ‘Look, he’s in the wilderness,’ don’t go out there, or ‘Look, he’s in the inner rooms,’ don’t believe it.
27 For just as lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
28 Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.


29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
30 Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
31 And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.


32 Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branches become tender and sprout leaves, you know that summer is near.
33 In the same way, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, right at the door.
34 I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things take place.
35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.


36 But about that day and hour, no one knows—not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
37 For as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
38 In those days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, right up to the day Noah entered the ark.
39 They didn’t know what was happening until the flood came and swept them all away. That’s how it will be with the coming of the Son of Man.
40 Two men will be in the field; one will be taken, and the other left.
41 Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken, and the other left.
42 So stay awake, because you don’t know on what day your Lord is coming.


43 But understand this: if the homeowner had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and not let his house be broken into.
44 For this reason, you also must be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.


45 Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time?
46 Blessed is that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.
47 I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
48 But if that wicked servant says to himself, ‘My master is delayed,’
49 and starts to beat his fellow servants and eat and drink with drunkards,
50 the master of that servant will come on a day he doesn’t expect and at an hour he doesn’t know.
51 He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.




Chapter 25


1 "At that time, the kingdom of heaven will be like ten young women who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.
2 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
3 The foolish ones took their lamps but didn’t bring any oil with them.
4 The wise ones, however, brought oil in jars along with their lamps.
5 When the groom was delayed, they all got drowsy and fell asleep.
6 But in the middle of the night, a shout rang out: ‘Here’s the groom! Come out to meet him!’
7 Then all the young women woke up and trimmed their lamps.
8 The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’
9 But the wise ones replied, ‘No, there won’t be enough for both us and you. Go instead to the sellers and buy some for yourselves.’
10 While they were off buying oil, the groom arrived. The ones who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.
11 Later, the others came back and said, ‘Lord, lord, open the door for us!’
12 But he answered, ‘Truly, I tell you, I don’t know you.’
13 So stay awake, because you don’t know the day or the hour.


14 "It’s like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
15 To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one—each according to their ability. Then he left on his trip.
16 The one who received five talents went right away and put them to work, earning five more.
17 Likewise, the one with two talents gained two more.
18 But the one who received one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money.
19 After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
20 The one who had received five talents came forward and brought the additional five, saying, ‘Master, you entrusted me with five talents; look, I’ve gained five more.’
21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful with a few things; I’ll put you in charge of many things. Come share your master’s joy.’
22 Then the one with two talents came and said, ‘Master, you entrusted me with two talents; look, I’ve gained two more.’
23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful with a few things; I’ll put you in charge of many things. Come share your master’s joy.’
24 Then the one who had received one talent came and said, ‘Master, I knew you were a harsh man, reaping where you didn’t sow and gathering where you didn’t scatter.
25 So I was afraid and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, take what’s yours.’
26 But his master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! You knew I reap where I didn’t sow and gather where I didn’t scatter?
27 Then you should’ve invested my money with the bankers, so that when I returned, I’d get it back with interest.
28 Take the talent from him and give it to the one with ten talents.
29 For to everyone who has, more will be given, and they’ll have an abundance; but from the one who doesn’t have, even what they do have will be taken away.
30 Throw this worthless servant out into the outer darkness, where there’ll be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’


31 "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, with all his angels with him, he’ll sit on his glorious throne.
32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he’ll separate them from one another, like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
33 He’ll place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
34 Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
35 For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you welcomed me;
36 I was naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you took care of me; I was in prison, and you visited me.’
37 Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink?
38 When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?
39 When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’
40 And the King will reply, ‘Truly, I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’
41 Then he’ll say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
42 For I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink;
43 I was a stranger, and you didn’t welcome me; I was naked, and you didn’t clothe me; I was sick and in prison, and you didn’t care for me.’
44 Then they’ll answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not help you?’
45 He’ll reply, ‘Truly, I tell you, whatever you didn’t do for one of the least of these, you didn’t do for me.’
46 And they’ll go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."




Chapter 26


1 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples,
2 "You know that the Passover is coming in two days, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified." 


3 At that time, the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas.
4 They plotted together to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him.
5 But they said, "Not during the festival, or there might be a riot among the people."


6 While Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper,
7 a woman approached him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he reclined at the table.
8 When the disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, "Why this waste?
9 This perfume could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor."
10 Aware of this, Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me.
11 You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
12 When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
13 Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her."


14 Then one of the Twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
15 and said, "What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?" They counted out thirty silver coins for him.
16 From that moment, he began looking for an opportunity to betray him.


17 On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
18 He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
19 The disciples did as Jesus instructed them and prepared the Passover.


20 When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.
21 As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
22 Deeply distressed, each one began to say to him, "Surely not I, Lord?"
23 He answered, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.
24 The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."
25 Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" Jesus replied, "You have said it."


26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
27 Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you;
28 for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
29 I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom."
30 After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.


31 Then Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away because of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
32 But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
33 Peter responded, "Even if everyone else falls away because of you, I will never fall away."
34 Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
35 Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" And all the disciples said the same thing.


36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
37 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
38 Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."
39 Going a little farther, he fell on his face and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as you will."
40 He came back to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Couldn’t you keep watch with me for one hour?
41 Watch and pray so that you don’t fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
42 He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done."
43 Again he returned and found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.
44 So he left them and went away once more and prayed a third time, saying the same thing.
45 Then he returned to the disciples and said, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
46 Get up, let’s go! See, my betrayer is here."


47 While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
48 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him."
49 Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
50 Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you came to do." Then they came forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
51 Suddenly, one of those with Jesus reached out, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
52 Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
53 Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once provide me with more than twelve legions of angels?
54 But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?"
55 At that moment Jesus said to the crowd, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to capture me as if I were a robber? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.
56 But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.


57 Those who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
58 Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat with the guards to see the outcome.
59 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus so they could put him to death,
60 but they found none, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two came forward
61 and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
62 The high priest stood up and said to him, "Have you no answer to what these men are testifying against you?"
63 But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
64 Jesus replied, "You have said it. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven."
65 Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, you have now heard the blasphemy.
66 What do you think?" They answered, "He deserves death."
67 Then they spit in his face and struck him. Some slapped him,
68 saying, "Prophesy to us, Messiah! Who hit you?"


69 Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came up to him and said, "You were with Jesus the Galilean too."
70 But he denied it in front of everyone, saying, "I don’t know what you’re talking about."
71 When he went out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
72 Again he denied it with an oath: "I don’t know the man!"
73 A little later, those standing there came up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away."
74 Then he began to curse and swear, "I don’t know the man!" Immediately a rooster crowed.
75 Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.




Chapter 27


1 When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus to put him to death.
2 They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.


3 Then Judas, the one who betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned. Overcome with remorse, he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
4 saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” But they replied, “What’s that to us? That’s your problem.”
5 So Judas threw the silver into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
6 The chief priests picked up the silver and said, “It’s not lawful to put this into the treasury, since it’s blood money.”
7 After deliberating, they used it to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners.
8 That’s why that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
9 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by some of the sons of Israel,
10 and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”


11 Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus responded, “You say so.”
12 But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer.
13 Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they’re testifying against you?”
14 Yet Jesus didn’t respond to him with even a single word, which greatly amazed the governor.


15 At the festival, it was the governor’s custom to release one prisoner to the crowd, whomever they wanted.
16 At that time, they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.
17 So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Who do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called the Messiah?”
18 For he knew they had handed Jesus over out of envy.
19 While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message: “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I’ve suffered greatly today in a dream because of him.”
20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
21 The governor asked them again, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” They shouted, “Barabbas!”
22 Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus, who is called the Messiah?” They all yelled, “Crucify him!”
23 He asked, “Why? What crime has he committed?” But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”


24 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere and that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I’m innocent of this man’s blood. See [to it] yourselves!”
25 All the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”
26 Then he released Barabbas to them, but he had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified.


27 Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around him.
28 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.
29 After twisting together a crown of thorns, they placed it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. Kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
30 They spat on him, took the reed, and struck him on the head.
31 When they had finished mocking him, they took off the robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him.


32 As they were going out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry Jesus’ cross.
33 When they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of the Skull),
34 they offered him wine mixed with gall to drink. But after tasting it, he refused to drink it.
35 After crucifying him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots.
36 Then they sat down and kept watch over him there.
37 Above his head, they placed the written charge against him: “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”
38 Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.


39 Those passing by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads
40 and saying, “You who were going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you’re the Son of God, come down from the cross!”
41 Likewise, the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,
42 “He saved others, but he can’t save himself! He’s the King of Israel—let him come down from the cross now, and we’ll believe in him.
43 He trusts in God; let God rescue him now if He wants him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”
44 Even the robbers crucified with him were taunting him in the same way.


45 From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness covered the whole land.
46 Around three o’clock, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”—which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
47 Some of those standing there, hearing this, said, “He’s calling for Elijah.”
48 Immediately one of them ran, took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.
49 But the others said, “Wait, let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.”
50 Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.


51 At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks split apart.
52 The tombs broke open, and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.
53 They came out of the tombs after his resurrection, entered the holy city, and appeared to many people.
54 When the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened, they were terrified and said, “Truly, this was the Son of God!”


55 Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.


57 As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who had also become a disciple of Jesus, came forward.
58 He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
59 Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
60 and placed it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and left.
61 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.


62 The next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate.
63 They said, “Sir, we remember that while he was still alive, that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’
64 So give the order to secure the tomb until the third day, otherwise his disciples might come, steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead.’ Then the last deception will be worse than the first.”
65 Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go and make it as secure as you know how.”
66 So they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting the guard.




Chapter 28


1 After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
2 Suddenly, there was a powerful earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, approached the tomb, rolled back the stone, and sat on it.
3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was white as snow.
4 The guards were so terrified of him that they shook and became like dead men.


5 But the angel spoke to the women, saying, “Don’t be afraid, for I know you’re looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
6 He’s not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.
7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. You’ll see him there.’ Look, I’ve told you.”


8 So they left the tomb quickly, with fear and great joy, and ran to report this to his disciples.
9 Suddenly, Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
10 Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to head to Galilee; they’ll see me there.”


11 While they were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
12 After meeting with the elders and making a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
13 instructing them, “Say this: ‘His disciples came at night and stole him while we were asleep.’
14 And if this gets back to the governor, we’ll handle him and keep you out of trouble.”
15 So they took the money and did as they were told. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.


16 Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
17 When they saw him, they worshiped him, though some hesitated.
18 Jesus came up to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
19 So go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
20 teaching them to obey everything I’ve commanded you. And look, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”﻿#The Gospel of Mark


##Chapter 1


1 The beginning of the Good News about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.


2 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Look, I am sending My messenger ahead of you, who will prepare Your way,
3 a voice of one calling out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the LORD, make His paths straight.’”[Exodus 23:20, Malachi 3:1, Isaiah 40:3]
4 John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
5 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him to be baptized by him in the Jordan River, and to confess their sins.
6 John was clothed with camel’s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
7 He preached, saying, “After me comes One who is mightier than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to bend down and untie.
8 I am baptizing you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”


9 In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan river.
10 As He was coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove.
11 And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; I am very pleased with You.”


12 Immediately the Spirit drove Him out into the wilderness.
13 He was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels were serving Him.


14 After John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the Good News of God,
15 and saying, “The time has been fulfilled [Daniel 9:24-26], and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the Good News!”


16 As He was passing along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
17 Jesus said to them, “Come. Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
18 Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
19 Going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets.
20 At once He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers and followed Him.


21 Then they went to Capernaum, and as soon as it was the Sabbath, He entered the synagogue and began teaching.
22 The people were astonished at His teaching, for He taught them as one having authority, and not like the scribes.
23 At that time, a man with an unclean spirit was in their synagogue, and He cried out,
24 saying, “What do You have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”
25 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!”
26 When the unclean spirit came out of him, it convulsed the man, who cried out with a loud voice.
27 They were all amazed, so they began discussing among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands unclean spirits, and they obey Him.”
28 At once His fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.


29 After leaving the synagogue, they went with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew.
30 Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and they immediately told Him about her.
31 So He came, took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.


32 That evening, after sunset, all who were sick or oppressed by demons were brought to Him,
33 so that he whole town was gathered at the door,
34 and He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew Him.


35 Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, He got up, left the house, and went off to a deserted place, where He was praying.
36 Simon and the others with him searched for Him,
37 and when they found Him, they said to Him, “Everyone is looking for You.”
38 He said to them, “Let’s go somewhere else—to the other villages in the area—so I can preach there too, for that is why I came.”
39 And He went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.


40 A man with leprosy came to Him, begging and kneeling, and said to Him, “If you are willing, You can make me clean.”
41 Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out His hand, touched him, and said to him, “I am willing; be clean.”
42 Immediately the leprosy left him, and He was made clean.
43 Jesus sternly warned him and sent him away at once,
44 saying to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice commanded by Moses for your cleansing [Leviticus 14:1-32], as a testimony to them.”
45 But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely and spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town but stayed out in deserted places. Even then, people kept coming to Him from everywhere.


##Chapter 2


1 After a few days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and word spread that He was at home.
2 A large crowd gathered, so much so that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and He began teaching them the word.
3 Some people came bringing a paralyzed man to Him, carried by four men.
4 Since they couldn’t get close to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof above where He was. After digging through it, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
5 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, “Child, your sins are forgiven.”


6 Now, some of the scribes were sitting there, reasoning in their hearts,
7 “Why does this man speak like this? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God alone?”
8 Immediately, Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were thinking this way to themselves, said to them, “Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts?
9 Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk’?
10 But, so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—He said to the paralyzed man,
11 “I tell you, get up, take your mat, and go home.”
12 And He got up, immediately picked up his mat, and went out in front of everyone. They were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We’ve never seen anything like this!”


13 Jesus went out again beside the sea, and the whole crowd came to Him, and He taught them.
14 As He passed by, He saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at a tax booth, and He said to him, “Follow me.” And Levi got up and followed him.


15 Later, Jesus was reclining at the table in Levi’s house, and many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Him and His disciples—for there were many who followed Him.
16 When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to His disciples, “Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
17 Hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It’s not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners.”


18 Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and some people came and asked Him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”
19 Jesus replied to them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast.
20 But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
21 No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the new patch pulls away from the old, and the tear becomes worse.
22 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine bursts the skins, and both the wine and the skins are ruined. No, new wine goes into fresh wineskins.”


23 One Sabbath, Jesus was passing through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pluck heads of grain as they walked.
24 The Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”
25 He responded to them, “Haven’t you ever read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him?
26 How he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the Presence, which isn’t lawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he also gave some to those who were with him?”
27 Then He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
28 So the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath.”


##Chapter 3


1 Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man was there with a withered hand.
2 Some people were watching Him closely to see if He would heal the man on the Sabbath, so they could accuse Him.
3 He said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up in the middle of everyone.”
4 Then He asked them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?” But they remained silent.
5 Looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” The man stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
6 The Pharisees went out immediately and began plotting with the Herodians against Him, discussing how they might destroy Him.


7 Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, and a large crowd followed Him from Galilee, Judea,
8 Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan river, and the region around Tyre and Sidon. They came to Him because they heard about everything He was doing.
9 He told his disciples to have a small boat ready for Him because of the crowd, so they wouldn’t crush Him.
10 For He had healed many, and as a result, all those who had diseases were pressing in on Him to touch Him.
11 Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and shouted, “You are the Son of God!”
12 But He sternly warned them not to make Him known.


13 Jesus went up on the mountain and called to Himself those He wanted, and they came to Him.
14 He appointed twelve, whom He also named apostles, to be with Him and to send them out to preach
15 and to have authority to cast out demons.
16 He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter),
17 James the son of Zebedee and John his brother (to whom He gave the name Boanerges, which means “Sons of Thunder”),
18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,
19 and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Him.


20 Then He went into a house, and the crowd gathered again, so that they couldn’t even eat a meal.
21 When His family heard about it, they went out to take hold of Him, for they were saying, “He’s out of His mind.”
22 The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He’s possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.”
23 So He called them over and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan cast out Satan?
24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
25 If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
26 And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, He cannot stand, but his end has come.
27 No one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.
28 Truly I tell you, all sins will be forgiven the children of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter,
29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin.”
30 He said this because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”


31 Then His mother and His brothers arrived, standing outside. They sent word to Him, calling for Him.
32 A crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, “Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You.”
33 He answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”
34 Looking around at those seated in a circle around Him, He said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!
35 For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”


##Chapter 4


1 Once again, Jesus began teaching beside the sea. A massive crowd gathered around Him, so He climbed into a boat and sat down while the entire crowd remained on the shore by the water.
2 He taught them many things through parables, and in His teaching, He said to them:
3 "Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.
4 As he was scattering it, some seed fell along the path, and the birds swooped down and ate it up.
5 Other seed fell on rocky ground where there wasn’t much soil. It sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow,
6 but when the sun came up, it scorched the plants, and since they had no deep roots, they withered away.
7 Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it out, so it produced nothing.
8 But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop, growing up and increasing—some producing thirty times, some sixty, and some a hundred times what was sown."
9 Then He added, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them listen."


10 When He was alone, those around him, along with the Twelve, asked him about the parables.
11 He told them, "The mystery of God’s kingdom has been entrusted to you. But to those outside, everything comes in parables,
12 so that ‘they may look and look but not perceive, and hear and hear but not understand, lest they turn and be forgiven.’"
13 Then He said to them, "Don’t you get this parable? How will you understand any of the parables?
14 The farmer sows the word.
15 Some people are like the seed along the path—where the word is sown, Satan comes right away and snatches it up before it can take root.
16 Others are like the seed sown on rocky ground—they hear the word and immediately accept it with joy,
17 but they don’t have deep roots. They last for a little while, but when trouble or persecution hits because of the word, they fall away fast.
18 Then there are those like the seed sown among thorns—they hear the word,
19 but the worries of this life, the lure of wealth, and cravings for other things creep in and choke it out, leaving it fruitless.
20 But those like the seed sown on good soil—they hear the word, welcome it, and produce a harvest: some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred times what was sown."


21 He went on to say to them, "Do you bring a lamp just to stick it under a basket or under the bed? No, you put it on a stand, right?
22 Because nothing is hidden that won’t be brought to light, and nothing is secret that won’t come out into the open.
23 If anyone has ears to hear, let them listen."
24 Then He added, "Pay attention to what you hear. The measure that you use, and even more, will be the measure used for what you receive.
25 So whoever has much will receive more; but whoever has little, even what they think they have will be taken away."


26 He also said, "The kingdom of God is like this: a man scatters seed on the ground,
27 and he sleeps and wakes, night and day, while the seed sprouts and grows—he doesn’t even know how—
28 the earth produces it all on its own. First the stalk appears, then the head, then the full grain in the head.
29 And when the crop is ready, he grabs the sickle right away, because harvest time has come."


30 He continued, "What can we compare the kingdom of God to, or what parable should we use for it?
31 It’s like a mustard seed, which, when sown in the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth.
32 But once it’s planted, it grows up and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with branches so big that the birds of the air can nest in its shade."


33 With many parables like these, He spoke the word to them, as much as they could handle.
34 He didn’t say anything to them without using a parable, but when He was alone with His own disciples, He explained everything.


35 That same day, when evening came, He said to them, "Let’s cross over to the other side."
36 Leaving the crowd behind, they took Him along in the boat, just as He was, and other boats were with Him.
37 A fierce windstorm kicked up, and waves started crashing into the boat, so it was already filling with water.
38 But Jesus was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. They woke Him up, shouting, "Teacher, don’t You care that we’re about to die?"
39 He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Quiet! Be still!" At this, the wind died down, and there was a great calm.
40 Then He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Don’t you have any faith yet?"
41 They were overwhelmed with awe and said to each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey Him!"




##Chapter 5


1 After this, they landed on the other side of the sea, in the region of the Gerasenes.
2 And when He stepped out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him.
3 He had his dwelling among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain,
4 because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains were torn apart by him, and the shackles were smashed, and no one had the strength to subdue him.
5 And night and day, among the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.


6 And seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before Him,
7 and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God, do not torment me!”
8 For He was saying to him, “Come out of the man, unclean spirit!”
9 And He asked him, “What is your name?” And he said to Him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”
10 And he begged Him earnestly not to send them out of the region.


11 Now at that place, near the mountain, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
12 And they begged Him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter them.”
13 And He permitted them. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs, and the herd—about two thousand in number—rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters.


14 And those who were feeding them fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside. And they came to see what had happened.
15 And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting, clothed, and in his right mind—the one who had the Legion—and they were afraid.
16 And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and about the pigs.
17 And they began to beg him to depart from their region.


18 And as He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed was begging him that He might be with him.
19 And He did not allow him, but said to him, “Go to your home, to your own people, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He had mercy on you.”
20 And He went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.


21 And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and He was by the sea.
22 And one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came, and seeing him, He fell at his feet
23 and begged him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, that she may be healed and live.”
24 And He went with him. And a large crowd followed him and pressed around him.


25 And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years,
26 and had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not helped at all but rather grew worse,
27 having heard about Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.
28 For she said, “If I touch even his garments, I will be healed.”
29 And immediately the flow of her blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.


30 And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my garments?”
31 And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing around you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”
32 And He looked around to see the woman who had done this.
33 But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.
34 And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free from your affliction.”


35 While He was still speaking, some came from the synagogue ruler’s house, saying, “Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”
36 But Jesus, overhearing the word being spoken, said to the synagogue ruler, “Do not fear, only believe.”
37 And He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James and John, the brother of James.
38 And they came to the house of the synagogue ruler, and He saw a commotion, and people weeping and wailing loudly.


39 And entering, He said to them, “Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child has not died but is sleeping.”
40 And they laughed at him. But He, having put them all out, took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was.
41 And taking the hand of the child, He said to her, “Talitha koum,” which is translated, “Little girl, I say to you, arise.”
42 And immediately the little girl got up and began walking—she was twelve years old—and they were immediately overcome with great amazement.
43 And He strictly charged them that no one should know this, and He told them to give her something to eat.




##Chapter 6


1 And He went out from there and came into his hometown, and his disciples followed him.
2 And when the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things, and what is this wisdom given to him, and how are such mighty works done by his hands?
3 Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.
4 And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.”
5 And He could do no mighty work there, except that He laid his hands on a few sick men and healed them.
6 And He marveled because of their unbelief. And He went around among the villages teaching.


7 And He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and He gave them authority over unclean spirits.
8 And He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—
9 but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.
10 And He said to them, “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there.
11 And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.”
12 And they went out and proclaimed that men should repent.
13 And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.


14 And King Herod heard of it, for Jesus’ name had become known, and He said, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these mighty works are at work in him.”
15 But others said, “He is Elijah.” And others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”
16 But when Herod heard it, He said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.”
17 For Herod himself had sent and seized John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because He had married her.
18 For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”
19 And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death, but she could not,
20 because Herod feared John, knowing that He was a righteous and holy man, and He kept him safe. When He heard him, He was greatly perplexed, and yet He heard him gladly.


21 But an opportunity came when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
22 When Herodias’s daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those reclining with him. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.”
23 And He swore to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.”
24 And she went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.”
25 And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”
26 And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests, He did not want to refuse her.
27 And immediately the king sent an executioner and ordered him to bring his head. And He went and beheaded him in the prison,
28 and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
29 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.


30 And the apostles gathered together with Jesus and reported to him all that they had done and taught.
31 And He said to them, “Come away by yourselves to an unfrequented place and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.
32 And they went away in the boat to an unfrequented place by themselves.
33 Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
34 And when He went ashore, He saw a great crowd, and He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.


35 And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote place, and the hour is now late.
36 Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
37 But He answered them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said to him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?”
38 And He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” And when they found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.”
39 Then He commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.
40 And they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
41 And taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. And He divided the two fish among them all.
42 And they all ate and were satisfied.
43 And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.
44 And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.


45 And immediately He made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd.
46 And after He had taken leave of them, He went up on the mountain to pray.
47 And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and He was alone on the land.
48 And He saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them,
49 but when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and cried out,
50 for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately He spoke to them and said, “Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.”
51 And He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,
52 for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.


53 And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore.
54 And when they got out of the boat, the men immediately recognized him
55 and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick on their beds to wherever they heard He was.
56 And wherever He came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.




##Chapter 7


1 Now the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him.
2 And they saw that some of his disciples were eating bread with unclean hands, that is, unwashed.
3 For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands carefully, holding to the tradition of the elders.
4 And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they cleanse themselves. And there are many other things they have received to observe: the washing of cups and pitchers and bronze vessels.
5 And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unclean hands?”


6 But He said to them, “Isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
7 In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’
8 Abandoning the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men.”
9 And He said to them, “You skillfully set aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition.
10 For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die.’
11 But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is Corban”’ (that is, a gift devoted to God),
12 then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother,
13 nullifying the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many such things like this.”


14 And calling the crowd to him again, He said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand:
15 There is nothing outside a man that enters into him that can defile him, but the things that come out of a man are what defile him.”
16 [Early manuscripts do not contain this verse]
17 And when He entered a house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable.
18 And He said to them, “Are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,
19 because it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and then goes out into the latrine, digesting all foods?”
20 And He said, “What comes out of a man, that is what defiles him.
21 For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,
22 greed, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.
23 All these evil things come from within and defile a man.”


24 And from there He arose and went away to the region of Tyre. And entering a house, He wanted no one to know, yet He could not escape notice.
25 But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell at his feet.
26 Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she kept asking him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
27 And He said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the bread of the children and throw it to the dogs.”
28 But she answered and said to him, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the crumbs of the children.”
29 And He said to her, “Because of this answer, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.”
30 And going back to her home, she found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone.


31 And again, departing from the region of Tyre, He came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the midst of the region of the Decapolis.
32 And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they begged him to lay his hand on him.
33 And taking him aside from the crowd privately, He put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, He touched his tongue.
34 And looking up to heaven, He sighed and said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.”
35 And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and He spoke plainly.
36 And He ordered them to tell no one, but the more He ordered them, the more exceedingly they proclaimed it.
37 And they were utterly astonished, saying, “He has done all things well; He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”




##Chapter 8


1 In those days, when a large crowd had gathered again and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them,
2 “I have compassion on the crowd because they have already stayed with me for three days and have nothing to eat.
3 If I send them away to their homes hungry, they will faint on the way, and some of them have come from far off.”
4 His disciples answered him, “Where can anyone get enough bread here in this desolate place to feed these men?”
5 He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.”
6 He directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves and giving thanks, He broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute, and they distributed them to the crowd.
7 They also had a few small fish. After blessing them, He said to distribute these as well.
8 They ate and were satisfied, and they picked up seven baskets full of the leftover pieces.
9 There were about four thousand men present. Then He sent them away.


10 Immediately He got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
11 The Pharisees came out and began to argue with him, demanding from him a sign from heaven to test him.
12 Sighing deeply in his spirit, He said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”
13 Leaving them, He got into the boat again and went to the other side.


14 The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.
15 He cautioned them, saying, “Watch out—beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”
16 They began discussing with one another that they had no bread.
17 Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you discussing that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
18 Having eyes, do you not see? Having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?
19 When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?” They said to him, “Twelve.”
20 “And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?” They said, “Seven.”
21 He said to them, “Do you not yet understand?”


22 They came to Bethsaida. Some men brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him.
23 Taking the blind man by the hand, He led him outside the village. After spitting on his eyes and laying his hands on him, He asked him, “Do you see anything?”
24 He looked up and said, “I see men, but they look like trees walking around.”
25 Then He laid his hands on his eyes again, and He saw clearly; He was restored and saw everything distinctly.
26 Jesus sent him to his home, saying, “Do not even enter the village.”


27 Jesus went out with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way, He asked his disciples, “Who do men say that I am?”
28 They answered him, “John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.”
29 He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.”
30 He strictly charged them to tell no one about him.


31 He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and after three days rise again.
32 He spoke this word openly. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
33 But turning and looking at his disciples, He rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”


34 Calling the crowd to him along with his disciples, He said to them, “If any man wants to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
35 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it.
36 For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?
37 Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
38 For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”




##Chapter 9


1 And He said to them, "Truly I say to you that there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God having come in power."


2 And after six days, Jesus took Peter, James and John and led them up to a high mountain by themselves, alone. And He was transfigured before them,
3 and his garments became radiant, exceedingly white, such as no launderer on earth could whiten them.
4 And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."
6 For He did not know what to say, because they were terrified.
7 And a cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud: "This is my beloved Son; listen to him."
8 And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus alone.


9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, He ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
10 And they kept the matter to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead might mean.
11 And they asked him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
12 And He said to them, "Elijah does come first and restores all things. And how is it written about the Son of Man, that He should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?
13 But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him."


14 And when they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes arguing with them.
15 And immediately, when the whole crowd saw him, they were greatly amazed and ran up to greet him.
16 And He asked them, "What are you arguing about with them?"
17 And one from the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to you, who has a mute spirit.
18 And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and He foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. And I told your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able."
19 And answering them, He said, "O faithless generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him to me."
20 And they brought him to him. And when the spirit saw him, it immediately convulsed the boy, and He fell on the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
21 And He asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And He said, "From childhood.
22 And many times it has thrown him into fire and into water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us."
23 And Jesus said to him, "If you can? All things are possible for the one who believes."
24 Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, "I believe; help my unbelief!"
25 And when Jesus saw that a crowd was running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."
26 And after crying out and convulsing him greatly, it came out. And the boy became like a corpse, so that many said, "He is dead."
27 But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up, and He stood up.


28 And when He had entered a house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why could we not cast it out?"
29 And He said to them, "This kind cannot come out by anything except prayer."


30 And leaving there, they passed through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know,
31 for He was teaching his disciples and saying to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him, and after being killed, He will rise after three days."
32 But they did not understand the statement, and they were afraid to ask him.


33 And they came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house, He asked them, "What were you discussing on the way?"
34 But they were silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.
35 And sitting down, He called the twelve and said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, He must be last of all and servant of all."
36 And taking a child, He set him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, He said to them,
37 "Whoever receives one of these children in my name receives me, and whoever receives me does not receive me but the one who sent me."


38 John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because He was not following us."
39 But Jesus said, "Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.
40 For the one who is not against us is for us.
41 For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ, truly I say to you, He will not lose his reward.


42 "And whoever causes one of these little ones who believes in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and He were thrown into the sea.
43 And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.
44 []
45 And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell.
46 []
47 And if your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell,
48 where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.
49 For everyone will be salted with fire.
50 Salt is good, but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."




##Chapter 10


1 Now rising up from there, He comes into the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan, and crowds gather to him again. As was his custom, He began teaching them once more.
2 Some Pharisees approached and asked him, testing him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”
3 He answered them, “What did Moses command you?”
4 They said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.”
5 Jesus said to them, “Because of the hardness of your hearts, He wrote this commandment for you.
6 But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’
7 ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,
8 and the two will become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
9 Therefore, what God has joined together, let no man separate.”


10 Later, in the house, his disciples asked him again about this matter.
11 He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.
12 And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”


13 Then they brought little children to him so He might touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
14 When Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them, “Let the little children come to me; do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
15 Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”
16 And taking them in his arms, He blessed them, laying his hands on them.


17 As He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up, knelt before him, and asked, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
18 Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.
19 You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.’”
20 He said to him, “Teacher, I have kept all these from my youth.”
21 Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, “One thing you lack: go, sell what you have, give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”
22 But at this word, He became gloomy and went away sorrowful, for He had many possessions.


23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!”
24 The disciples were amazed at his words, but Jesus spoke again and said, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
25 It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”
26 They were exceedingly astonished and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?”
27 Looking at them, Jesus said, “With man it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.”


28 Peter began to say to him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”
29 Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the gospel’s sake,
30 who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.
31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”


32 They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. They were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. Taking the twelve aside again, He began to tell them what was going to happen to him:
33 “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles.
34 They will mock him, spit on him, flog him, and kill him, and after three days He will rise.”


35 James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.”
36 He said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”
37 They said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.”
38 Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?”
39 They said to him, “We can.” Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism I am baptized with you will be baptized,
40 but to sit at my right or left is not mine to grant; it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”


41 When the ten heard this, they began to be indignant at James and John.
42 Jesus called them to himself and said, “You know that those regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
43 But it is not so among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
44 and whoever wants to be first among you must be slave of all.
45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”


46 Then they came to Jericho. As He was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside.
47 When He heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, He began to cry out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
48 Many rebuked him, telling him to be quiet, but He cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
49 Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” They called the blind man, saying to him, “Take courage, get up; He is calling you.”
50 Throwing off his cloak, He sprang up and came to Jesus.
51 Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him, “Rabboni, I want to see again.”
52 Jesus said to him, “Go; your faith has healed you.” Immediately He regained his sight and followed him on the way.




##Chapter 11


1 As they approached Jerusalem, near Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples,
2 saying to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied up, on which no man has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.
3 If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.’”
4 They went away and found a colt tied near a door, outside in the street. As they untied it,
5 some of the men standing there said to them, "What are you doing, untying the colt?"
6 They answered them just as Jesus had said, and the men let them go. 


7 They brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, and He sat on it.
8 Many men spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut from the fields.
9 Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!
10 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father, David! Hosanna in the highest!"


11 He entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. After looking around at everything, since it was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.


12 The next day, as they left Bethany, He was hungry.
13 Seeing a fig tree in the distance with leaves, He went to see if He could find anything on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
14 He said to it, "May no man eat fruit from you again forever." And His disciples heard Him.


15 They came to Jerusalem, and He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves,
16 and He would not allow any man to carry anything through the temple.
17 He taught them, saying, "Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers."
18 The chief priests and the scribes heard this and began seeking a way to destroy Him, for they feared Him because the whole crowd was amazed at His teaching.
19 When evening came, they went out of the city.


20 In the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.
21 Peter remembered and said to Him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree You cursed has withered."
22 Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God.
23 Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what He says will happen, it will be done for him.
24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
25 And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against any man, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."


26 []


27 They came again to Jerusalem. As He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him,
28 and they said to Him, "By what authority are You doing these things? Or who gave You this authority to do them?"
29 Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question; answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
30 The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me."
31 They discussed it among themselves, saying, "If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’
32 But if we say, ‘From men’"—they feared the crowd, for all held that John was truly a prophet.
33 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."




##Chapter 12


1 Then He began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard, set a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a tower. He leased it to tenant farmers and went away on a journey.
2 At the harvest time, He sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.
3 But they seized him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
4 Again, He sent another servant to them, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully.
5 He sent another, and that one they killed. And so with many others—some they beat, and others they killed.
6 He still had one left to send, a beloved son. He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
7 But those tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
8 So they took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
9 What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.
10 Have you not read this Scripture: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;
11 this was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
12 And they were seeking to arrest him but feared the crowd, for they understood that He had spoken the parable against them. So they left him and went away.


13 Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and Herodians to trap him in his words.
14 They came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone’s opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?”
15 But knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, “Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.”
16 They brought one, and He said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” They said to him, “Caesar’s.”
17 Jesus said to them, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they marveled at him.


18 Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him a question, saying,
19 “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
20 There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and when He died, He left no offspring.
21 The second took her and died, leaving no offspring, and the third likewise.
22 The seven left no offspring. Last of all, the woman also died.
23 In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.”
24 Jesus said to them, “Is this not the reason you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?
25 For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
26 And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?
27 He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite wrong.”


28 One of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that He answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”
29 Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
30 And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’
31 The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”
32 And the scribe said to him, “You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that He is one, and there is no other besides him.
33 And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
34 And when Jesus saw that He answered wisely, He said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And after that, no one dared to ask him any more questions.


35 While Jesus was teaching in the temple, He said, “How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
36 David himself, in the Holy Spirit, declared, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.”’
37 David himself calls him Lord, so how is He his son?” And the great throng heard him gladly.


38 In his teaching He said, “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and receive greetings in the marketplaces
39 and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,
40 who devour widows’ houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”


41 He sat down opposite the treasury and watched the crowd putting money into the offering box. Many rich men put in large sums.
42 A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny.
43 He called his disciples to him and said to them, “Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box.
44 For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.”




##Chapter 13


1 As He was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Teacher, look! What massive stones and what impressive buildings!"
2 And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left on another; all will be thrown down."


3 While He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,
4 "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled?"
5 Jesus began to say to them, "Watch out that no one deceives you.
6 Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am He,' and they will deceive many.
7 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; these things must happen, but the end is not yet.
8 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places, there will be famines—these are the beginning of birth pains.


9 But be on your guard; they will hand you over to councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them.
10 And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.
11 When they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you will say, but say whatever is given to you in that hour, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
12 Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.
13 And you will be hated by all men because of my name, but the one who endures to the end will be saved.


14 When you see the abomination of desolation standing where He ought not to be—let the reader understand—then let those in Judea flee to the mountains.
15 Let the man on the housetop not go down or enter to take anything from his house,
16 and let the man in the field not turn back to get his cloak.
17 Woe to pregnant women and to those nursing infants in those days!
18 Pray that it may not happen in winter.
19 For those days will bring tribulation such as has not been seen from the beginning of creation, which God created, until now, and never will be again.
20 If the Lord had not cut short those days, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He has shortened the days.


21 Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there He is!' do not believe it.
22 For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
23 But you, be on guard; I have told you all things beforehand.


24 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,
25 and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
26 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
27 And then He will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.


28 Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: when its branch becomes tender and puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.
29 So also, when you see these things happening, you know that He is near, at the very gates.
30 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.


32 But concerning that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
33 Be on guard, stay awake, for you do not know when the time will come.
34 It is like a man going on a journey, who left his house and gave authority to his servants, to each his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to stay awake.
35 Therefore, stay awake—for you do not know when the master of the house will come, whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning—
36 lest He come suddenly and find you sleeping.
37 What I say to you, I say to all: Stay awake!"




##Chapter 14


1 It was now two days before the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him,
2 for they were saying, “Not during the festival, lest there be an uproar from the crowd.”


3 While He was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He reclined at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, pure nard. She broke the flask and poured it over his head.
4 But some were indignantly saying to one another, “Why has this ointment been wasted?
5 For this could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.” And they scolded her.
6 But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
7 For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them, but you will not always have me.
8 She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial.
9 Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.”


10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him to them.
11 When they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. So He began seeking how He might conveniently betray him.


12 On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?”
13 He sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him,
14 and wherever He enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’
15 He will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; prepare for us there.”
16 The disciples went out, entered the city, and found it just as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.


17 When it was evening, He came with the twelve.
18 As they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.”
19 They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, “Is it I?”
20 He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me.
21 For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if He had not been born.”


22 While they were eating, He took bread, and after blessing it, broke it and gave it to them, and said, “Take; this is my body.”
23 Then He took a cup, and after giving thanks, He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
24 He said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
25 Truly I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”


26 After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
27 Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’
28 But after I am raised, I will go before you to Galilee.”
29 Peter said to him, “Even if all fall away, I will not.”
30 Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”
31 But He said emphatically, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And they all said the same.


32 They came to a place called Gethsemane, and He said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”
33 He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled.
34 He said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch.”
35 Going a little farther, He fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
36 He said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.”
37 He came and found them sleeping, and He said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?
38 Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
39 Again He went away and prayed, saying the same words.
40 And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him.
41 He came the third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough; the hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
42 Rise, let us go. See, my betrayer is at hand.”


43 Immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
44 Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard.”
45 Coming up at once, He went to him and said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him.
46 They laid hands on him and seized him.
47 But one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
48 Jesus said to them, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?
49 Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the Scriptures be fulfilled.”
50 And they all left him and fled.


51 A certain young man was following him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth. They seized him,
52 but He left the linen cloth and ran away naked.


53 They led Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together.
54 Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest, and He was sitting with the guards, warming himself at the fire.
55 Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none.
56 For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree.
57 Some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,
58 “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands.’”
59 Yet even about this their testimony did not agree.
60 The high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?”
61 But He remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”
62 Jesus said, “I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”
63 The high priest tore his garments and said, “What further witnesses do we need?
64 You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?” They all condemned him as deserving death.
65 Some began to spit on him, to cover his face, and to strike him, saying to him, “Prophesy!” And the guards received him with blows.


66 While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came,
67 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”
68 But He denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean.” And He went out into the gateway, and the rooster crowed.
69 The servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.”
70 But again He denied it. After a little while, the bystanders again said to Peter, “Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.”
71 But He began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak.”
72 And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And He broke down and wept.




##Chapter 15


1 As soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.
2 Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He answered him, "You say so."
3 The chief priests accused him of many things.
4 Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer? Look how many charges they bring against you."
5 But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed.


6 Now at the festival He used to release for them one prisoner whom they requested.
7 A man called Barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection.
8 The crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do for them according to his custom.
9 Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"
10 For He knew that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.
11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas for them instead.
12 Pilate, responding again, said to them, "What then do you want me to do with the man you call the King of the Jews?"
13 They shouted back, "Crucify him!"
14 Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him!"
15 So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them; and after having Jesus flogged, He handed him over to be crucified.


16 The soldiers led him away into the courtyard, that is, the governor’s headquarters, and they called together the whole cohort.
17 They clothed him in a purple robe and, after twisting together a crown of thorns, put it on him.
18 They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
19 They struck his head with a reed, spat on him, and knelt down in homage to him.
20 After mocking him, they stripped him of the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.


21 They compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country—the father of Alexander and Rufus—to carry his cross.
22 They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull.
23 They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it.
24 Then they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them to decide what each man should take.


25 It was the third hour when they crucified him.
26 The inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews."
27 With him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.
29 Those passing by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "Ha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
30 save yourself and come down from the cross!"
31 Likewise, the chief priests, along with the scribes, mocked him among themselves, saying, "He saved others; He cannot save himself.
32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe." Those crucified with him also reviled him.


33 When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.
34 At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
35 Some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, "Look, He is calling Elijah."
36 One man ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to take him down."
37 But Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed his last.


38 The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
39 When the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that He breathed his last in this way, He said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"
40 There were also women watching from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.
41 These women had followed him and ministered to him when He was in Galilee, and many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were there too.


42 When evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
43 Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council who was also himself waiting for the kingdom of God, came and boldly went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
44 Pilate was surprised that He was already dead; summoning the centurion, He asked him whether He had been dead for some time.
45 When He learned from the centurion that it was so, He granted the body to Joseph.
46 Joseph bought a linen cloth, took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. He rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where He was laid.




##Chapter 16


1 After the Sabbath had passed, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so they could go and anoint him.
2 Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they came to the tomb.
3 They were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?"
4 But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.
5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.


6 But He said to them, "Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See the place where they laid him.
7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as He told you.'"
8 Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.


9 When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had driven seven demons.
10 She went and told those who had been with him, as they were mourning and weeping.
11 But when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.


12 After this, He appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking into the countryside.
13 They returned and reported it to the rest, but they did not believe them either.


14 Later, He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table. He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after He had risen.
15 He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
16 He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but He who does not believe will be condemned.
17 These signs will accompany those who believe in my name: they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
18 they will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not harm them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover."


19 So then, after the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
20 And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word through the accompanying signs.﻿The Gospel of Luke


Chapter 1


1 Since many have undertaken to compile a narrative about the events that have been fulfilled among us,
2 just as those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning and servants of the word handed them down to us,
3 it seemed good to me also, having carefully investigated everything from the start, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.


5 In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, from the division of Abijah, and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, named Elizabeth.
6 They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord.
7 But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.


8 Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty,
9 according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.
11 And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
12 And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.
13 But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
14 And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,
15 for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.
16 And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,
17 and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.”


18 And Zechariah said to the angel, “How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.”
19 And the angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
20 And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.”
21 And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple.
22 And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute.
23 And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.


24 After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying,
25 “Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.”


26 In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary.
28 And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one, the Lord is with you!”
29 But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be.
30 And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
31 And you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David,
33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”


34 And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I do not know a man?”
35 And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God.
36 And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.
37 For nothing will be impossible with God.”
38 And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.


39 In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah,
40 and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.
41 And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,
42 and she exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
43 And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
44 For when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
45 And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”


46 And Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord,
47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
48 for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. For from now on all generations will call me blessed;
49 for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.
50 And his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.
51 He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts;
52 he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate;
53 he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty.
54 He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,
55 as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever.”
56 And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.


57 Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.
58 And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
59 And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father,
60 but his mother answered, “No; he shall be called John.”
61 And they said to her, “None of your relatives is called by this name.”
62 And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called.
63 And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they all wondered.
64 And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.
65 And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea,
66 and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be?” For the hand of the Lord was with him.


67 And Zechariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,
68 “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people
69 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,
70 as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,
71 that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us;
72 to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,
73 the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us
74 that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear,
75 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
76 And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,
77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins,
78 because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high
79 to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”


80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.




Chapter 2


1 In those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the inhabited world should be registered.
2 This registration first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria.
3 And everyone went to be registered, each to his own city.
4 So Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,
5 to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was pregnant.
6 And it happened that while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to give birth.
7 And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.


8 And in that same region, shepherds were staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.
9 And an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.
10 And the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid, for I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the men.
11 For today in the city of David a Savior has been born to you, who is Christ the Lord.
12 And this will be the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."
13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
14 "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace to men of good-will."


15 And it happened that when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us."
16 And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.
17 And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning the child.
18 And all who heard it marveled at what was spoken to them by the shepherds.
19 But Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart.
20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just as it had been told them.


21 And when eight days were completed for his circumcision, his name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.


22 And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
23 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord")
24 and to offer a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, "a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons."


25 And there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
26 And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
27 And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him according to the custom of the law,
28 he took him into his arms and blessed God and said,
29 "Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word;
30 for my eyes have seen your salvation,
31 which you have prepared in the presence of all the nations,
32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory to your people Israel."


33 And his father and mother were marveling at the things being said about him.
34 And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, "Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be opposed—
35 and a sword will pierce through your own soul also—so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."


36 And there was Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,
37 and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day.
38 And coming up at that very hour, she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for pthe redemption of Jerusalem.


39 And when they had completed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.
40 And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him.


41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.
42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the feast.
43 And when the days were completed, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, and his parents did not know it.
44 But supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey, and they sought him among their relatives and acquaintances.
45 And when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.
46 And it happened that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
47 And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
48 And when they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress."
49 And he said to them, "Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be involved in the things of my Father?"
50 And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them.


51 And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them. And his mother kept all these things in her heart.
52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man.




Chapter 3


1 Now in the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar’s reign, when Pontius Pilate was governing Judea, Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,
2 during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.
3 He went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,
4 as it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth;
6 and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.’”


7 So he said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
8 Bear fruits worthy of repentance. Do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able to raise up children of Abraham from these stones.
9 Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”


10 The crowds asked him, “What then shall we do?”
11 He answered them, “He who has two tunics, let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.”
12 Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, “Teacher, what shall we do?”
13 He said to them, “Collect no more than what is prescribed for you.”
14 Soldiers also asked him, “And we, what shall we do?” He said to them, “Do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation, and be content with your wages.”


15 As the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ,
16 John answered them all, “I baptize you with water; but he who is mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
17 His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”


18 So, with many other exhortations, he preached good news to the people.
19 But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done,
20 added this to them all, that he locked up John in prison.


21 Now when all the men were baptized, Jesus also was baptized, and while he was praying, heaven was opened,
22 and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”


23 Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,
24 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
25 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
26 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,
27 the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
28 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,
29 the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
30 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
31 the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
32 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala, the son of Nahshon,
33 the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
34 the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
35 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,
36 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,
38 the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.




Chapter 4


1 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
2 where he was tempted by the devil for forty days. During that time, he ate nothing, and when it was over, he was hungry.
3 The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."
4 Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.'"
5 Then the devil led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
6 The devil said to him, "I will give you all this authority and their glory, for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.
7 Then, If you will worship me, it will all be yours."
8 Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve only him.'"


9 Then he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,
10 for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,'
11 and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"
12 Jesus answered him, "It is said, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
13 When the devil had finished every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.


14 Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news about him spread throughout the surrounding region.
15 He was teaching in their synagogues, being glorified by all.


16 He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and as was his custom, he entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read.
17 The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him, and unrolling the scroll, he found the place where it was written,
18 "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed,
19 to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."
20 He rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.
21 He began to say to them, "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."
22 All were speaking well of him and marveling at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. They said, "Is this not Joseph's son?"
23 He said to them, "Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, 'Physician, heal yourself.' What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well."
24 He said, "Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.
25 But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land,
26 and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a widow there.
27 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian."
28 When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath.
29 They rose up, drove him out of the town, and brought him to the edge of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff.
30 But passing through their midst, he went away.


31 He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbath.
32 They were astonished at his teaching, for his word possessed authority.
33 In the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
34 "Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God."
35 Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent and come out of him!" And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, it came out of him without harming him.
36 Amazement came upon all, and they spoke to one another, saying, "What is this message? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!"
37 And reports about him went out into every place in the surrounding region.


38 He arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked him about her.
39 He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she rose and began to serve them.


40 When the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.
41 Demons also came out of many, crying, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.


42 When it was day, he departed and went into a desolate place. The crowds were seeking him and came to him, and they tried to keep him from leaving them.
43 But he said to them, "I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well, for I was sent for this purpose."
44 And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.




Chapter 5


1 While the crowd was pressing in on Jesus and listening to the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.
2 He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake, but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.
3 Getting into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, he asked him to put out a little from the land. Then he sat down and began teaching the crowds from the boat.
4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.”
5 Simon answered, “Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing. But at your word, I will let down the nets.”
6 When they had done this, they enclosed a great number of fish, and their nets began to break.
7 They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
8 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord!”
9 For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,
10 and so were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, “Do not fear; from now on you will be catching men.”
11 When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.


12 While he was in one of the cities, a man full of leprosy came to him. Seeing Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
13 Stretching out his hand, he touched him, saying, “I am willing; be clean.” Immediately the leprosy left him.
14 He ordered him to tell no one, “But go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”
15 Yet the report about him spread even more, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.
16 But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.


17 On one of those days, while he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal.
18 Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to bring him in and set him before Jesus.
19 Not finding a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him with his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.
20 Seeing their faith, he said, “Man, your sins are forgiven you.”
21 The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
22 Jesus, knowing their thoughts, answered them, “Why do you reason like this in your hearts?
23 Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’?
24 But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralyzed man—“I say to you, rise, pick up your mat, and go to your house.”
25 Immediately he stood up before them, took what he had been lying on, and went to his house glorifying God.
26 Amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, “We have seen extraordinary things today.”


27 After this, he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth. He said to him, “Follow me.”
28 Leaving everything, he rose and followed him.
29 Levi made him a great feast in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them.
30 The Pharisees and their scribes grumbled at his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”
31 Jesus answered them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick do.
32 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”


33 They said to him, “The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.”
34 Jesus said to them, “Can you make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?
35 The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.”
36 He also told them a parable: “No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. If he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.
37 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and spill, and the skins will be destroyed.
38 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
39 And no one after drinking old wine desires new, for he says, ‘The old is good.’”




Chapter 6


1 Now it happened on a Sabbath that He was passing through grainfields, and His disciples were picking and eating the heads of grain, and rubbing them in their hands.
2 But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”
3 And Jesus answered them, saying, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?
4 How he entered the house of God and took the bread of the Presence, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests alone, and he ate it and gave it to those with him?”
5 And He said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”


6 On another Sabbath, He entered the synagogue and was teaching, and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.
7 The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He would heal on the Sabbath, so they might find a reason to accuse Him.
8 But He knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand, “Get up and stand in the middle.” And he got up and stood there.
9 Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy it?”
10 And after looking around at them all, He said to him, “Stretch out your hand.” And he did so, and his hand was restored.
11 But they were filled with rage and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.


12 Now in those days, He went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God.
13 And when day came, He called His disciples and chose twelve of them, whom He also named apostles:
14 Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,
15 and Matthew and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,
16 and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.


17 And He came down with them and stood on a level place with a large crowd of His disciples and a great multitude of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon,
18 who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases. And those who were troubled by unclean spirits were being cured.
19 And the whole crowd was trying to touch Him, because power was coming from Him and healing them all.


20 And lifting up His eyes to His disciples, He said, “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
21 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
22 Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man.
23 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for see how your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same to the prophets.


24 But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your comfort.
25 Woe to you who are full now, for you will hunger. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
26 Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same to the false prophets.


27 But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
29 To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also, and from the one who takes your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either.
30 Give to everyone who asks you, and from the one who takes your things, do not demand them back.
31 And just as you want men to do to you, do to them likewise.


32 If you love those who love you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
33 And if you do good to those who do good to you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
34 And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what benefit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners to receive back the same amount.
35 But love your enemies, and do good. And lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for He is kind to the ungrateful and the evil.
36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.


37 Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven.
38 Give, and it will be given to you—a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.”


39 And He also spoke a parable to them: “Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?
40 A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.
41 Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye?
42 How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the speck in your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck from your brother’s eye.


43 For there is no good tree that produces bad fruit, nor again a bad tree that produces good fruit.
44 For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a bramble bush.
45 The good man out of the good treasure of his heart produces good works, and the evil man out of his evil treasure produces evil works, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.


46 How can you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ but not do what I say?
47 Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and does them, I will show you what he is like:
48 he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood came, the stream burst against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built.
49 But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation, against which the stream burst, and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.”




Chapter 7


1 Now when he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the crowd, he entered Capernaum.
2 A centurion there had a slave whom he valued highly, who was sick and about to die.
3 When he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his slave.
4 When they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to grant this to him,
5 for he loves our nation and even built our synagogue for us.”
6 So Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.
7 That is why I did not consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed.
8 For I too am a man placed under authority, with soldiers under me, and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
9 When Jesus heard this, he marveled at him and, turning to the crowd following him, said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.”
10 When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.


11 Soon afterward, he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him.
12 As he approached the gate of the town, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A sizable crowd from the town was with her.
13 When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, “Do not weep.”
14 Then he came up and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, arise.”
15 The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.
16 Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has risen among us!” and “God has visited his people!”
17 This report about him spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding region.


18 The disciples of John reported all these things to him. So John called two of his disciples
19 and sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?”
20 When the men came to him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?’”
21 At that very hour, he healed many men of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and to many who were blind he granted sight.
22 He answered them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news preached to them.
23 Blessed is the man who does not stumble because of me.”


24 When John’s messengers had left, he began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
25 But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Look, those who wear fine clothing and live in luxury are in kings’ courts.
26 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
27 This is he of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’
28 I tell you, among those born of women, no one is greater than John, yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”
29 (All the crowd who heard this, including the tax collectors, acknowledged God’s justice, having been baptized with the baptism of John.
30 But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God’s purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)


31 “To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?
32 They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a lament, and you did not weep.’
33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’
34 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’
35 Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.”


36 One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee’s house and reclined at table.
37 And behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment.
38 Standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
39 When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.”
40 Jesus, answering, said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he replied, “Say it, Teacher.”
41 “A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
42 When they could not pay, he forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?”
43 Simon answered, “I suppose the one for whom he forgave more.” And he said to him, “You have judged rightly.”
44 Then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
45 You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in, she has not stopped kissing my feet.
46 You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.
47 Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.”
48 And he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”
49 Those who were reclining at table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”
50 And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”




Chapter 8


1 Soon afterward, he was traveling from one city and village to another, proclaiming and announcing the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,
2 along with some women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,
3 Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, Susanna, and many others who were providing for them out of their own resources.


4 When a large crowd had gathered and men were coming to him from every city, he spoke through a parable:
5 “A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the sky ate it up.
6 Other seed fell on the rock, and when it grew, it withered because it had no moisture.
7 Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.
8 Still other seed fell on good soil, and when it grew, it produced a hundredfold.” As he said these things, he called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”


9 His disciples asked him what this parable meant.
10 He said, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is given in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
12 Those along the path are the ones who hear, but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
13 Those on the rock are the ones who, when they hear, receive the word with joy, but they have no root; they believe for a while, but in a time of testing they fall away.
14 That which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.
15 But the seed falling on the good soil, these are the ones who, having heard the word with an honest and good heart, hold it fast and bear fruit with endurance.


16 “No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a basket or puts it under a bed, but he sets it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.
17 For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, nor secret that will not be known and come to light.
18 Take care, then, how you hear; for to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away.”


19 Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.
20 Someone told him, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”
21 But he answered them, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.”


22 One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, “Let us go across to the other side of the lake.” So they set out,
23 and as they sailed, he fell asleep. A windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger.
24 They went to him and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” He awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
25 He said to them, “Where is your faith?” They were afraid and amazed, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”


26 Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
27 When he stepped ashore, a man from the city who had demons met him. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he did not live in a house but among the tombs.
28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.”
29 For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many times it had seized him; he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilderness.)
30 Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered him.
31 They begged him not to command them to go into the abyss.
32 Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they pleaded with him to let them enter them. He gave them permission.
33 Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.


34 When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.
35 Then men went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.
36 Those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.
37 Then all the men of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.
38 The man from whom the demons had gone begged to be with him, but he sent him away, saying,
39 “Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.


40 Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
41 And a man named Jairus came, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell at Jesus’ feet and begged him to come to his house,
42 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. As he went, the crowds pressed around him.


43 And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years and could not be healed by anyone
44 came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her flow of blood ceased.
45 Jesus said, “Who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!”
46 But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, for I know that power has gone out from me.”
47 When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling and fell down before him and declared in the presence of all the men why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.
48 He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.”


49 While he was still speaking, someone came from the ruler’s house, saying, “Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher anymore.”
50 But Jesus, on hearing this, answered him, “Do not fear; only believe, and she will be well.”
51 When he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother.
52 They were all weeping and mourning for her, but he said, “Do not weep, for she is not dead but sleeping.”
53 And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
54 But taking her by the hand, he called, saying, “Child, arise.”
55 Her life returned, and she got up at once. He directed that something should be given her to eat.
56 Her parents were astonished, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.




Chapter 9


1 Now when he had called together his twelve disciples, he gave them authority and power over all demons and to heal diseases.
2 He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to cure the sick.
3 He said to them, "Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, and do not have two tunics each.
4 Whatever house you enter, stay there, until you leave from that place.
5 And wherever they do not receive you, as you leave that town, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them."
6 So they went out and traveled through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.


7 Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was happening, and he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,
8 others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the ancient prophets had risen.
9 Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who then is this about whom I hear such things?" And he sought to see him.


10 When the apostles returned, they reported to him all that they had done. Taking them with him, he withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida.
11 But the crowds learned of it and followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.
12 As the day began to draw to a close, the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and food, for we are in a remote place here."
13 But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They replied, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these men."
14 For there were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."
15 They did so and had them all sit down.
16 Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, blessed them, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
17 They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve baskets of the broken pieces that were left over.


18 Now it happened that as he was praying alone, his disciples were with him. He asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"
19 They answered, "John the Baptist; but others say Elijah, and others that one of the ancient prophets has risen."
20 Then he said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God."
21 He strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,
22 saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and on the third day be raised."


23 He said to all, "If any man wants to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.
24 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
25 For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?
26 Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
27 But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God."


28 About eight days after these sayings, he took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray.
29 As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothing became dazzling white.
30 And they saw two men talking with him, Moses and Elijah,
31 who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
32 Now Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
33 As the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah"—not knowing what he was saying.
34 While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
35 A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him."
36 When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.


37 On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
38 And a man from the crowd cried out, "Teacher, I beg of you, look at my son, for he is my only child.
39 A spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it throws him into convulsions with foaming at the mouth, and it departs from him only after bruising him.
40 I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."
41 Jesus answered, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long will I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."
42 While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
43 And all were astonished at the majesty of God.


While everyone was marveling at all that he was doing, he said to his disciples,
44 "Let these words sink into your ears: the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men."
45 But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them so that they did not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.


46 An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.
47 But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and set him by his side,
48 and said to them, "Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great."


49 John answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he does not follow you along with us."
50 But Jesus said to him, "Do not stop him, for he who is not against you is for you."


51 When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.
52 He sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make preparations for him.
53 But they did not receive him because his face was set toward Jerusalem.
54 When his disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to consume them?"
55 But he turned and rebuked them,
56 and they went on to another village.


57 As they were going along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
58 Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
59 To another he said, "Follow me." But he said, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
60 Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God."
61 Another said, "I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say farewell to those at my home."
62 Jesus said to him, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."




Chapter 10


1 After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them out two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.
2 He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.
3 Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
4 Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.
5 When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.'
6 If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you.
7 Stay in that house, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.
8 When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is set before you.
9 Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'
10 But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say,
11 'Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.'
12 I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.


13 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
14 But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
15 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.
16 He who listens to you listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.


17 The seventy-two returned with joy and said, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name."
18 He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
19 I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.
20 However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."


21 At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.
22 All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
23 Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.
24 For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it."


25 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
26 "What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"
27 He answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"
28 "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."
29 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"


30 In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.
31 A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.
32 So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
33 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.
34 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.
35 The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'
36 Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"
37 The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."


38 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.
39 She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.
40 But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!"
41 "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about many things,
42 but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."




Chapter 11


1 And it happened that while he was praying in a certain place, when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."
2 And he said to them, "When you pray, say: Father, let your name be honored as holy; let your kingdom come.
3 Give us each day our daily bread.
4 And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation."


5 And he said to them, "Which of you will have a friend and will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,
6 since a friend of mine has arrived from a journey to visit me, and I have nothing to set before him’?
7 And that one, answering from inside, says, ‘Do not bother me; the door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything.’
8 I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him whatever he needs."


9 "And I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
10 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.
11 Now which father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a snake?
12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
13 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in Heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"


14 And he was casting out a demon, and the man was mute. And when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the crowds marveled.
15 But some of them said, "By Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, he casts out demons."
16 And others, testing him, were seeking from him a sign from heaven.
17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a house divided against a house falls.
18 And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
19 But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
20 But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
21 When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are secure.
22 But when one stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his spoils.
23 The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters."


24 "When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding it, it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’
25 And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order.
26 Then it goes and brings other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first."


27 And it happened that as he was saying these things, a woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts at which you nursed!"
28 But he said, "Rather, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it."


29 Now as the crowds were increasing, he began to say, "This generation is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.
30 For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.
31 The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
32 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here."


33 "No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.
34 The lamp of your body is your eye. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is bad, your body is full of darkness.
35 Therefore, watch out that the light in you is not darkness.
36 If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, as when a lamp with its rays gives you light."


37 While he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. So he went in and reclined at table.
38 The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner.
39 And the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
40 You fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?
41 But give as alms those things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you."


42 "But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
43 Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.
44 Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, and men walk over them without knowing it."


45 One of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, in saying these things you insult us also."
46 And he said, "Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
47 Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed.
48 So you are witnesses and you consent to the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them, and you build their tombs.
49 Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,’
50 so that the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,
51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.
52 Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering."


53 As he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard and to provoke him, asking about many things,
54 lying in wait for him, to catch him in something he might say.




Chapter 12


1 Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling one another, he began to say to his disciples first, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
2 Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.
3 Therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.


4 I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and cannot do anything else to you after that.
5 But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!
6 Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God.
7 Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.


8 And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God,
9 but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
10 And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
11 And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say,
12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say."


13 Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
14 But he said to him, "Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?"
15 And he said to them, "Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for a man’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."
16 And he told them a parable, saying, "The land of a rich man produced plentifully,
17 and he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’
18 And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.
19 And I will say to myself, “You have ample goods laid up for yourself for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.”’
20 But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your life is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’
21 So is the man who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God."


22 And he said to his disciples, "Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on.
23 For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.
24 Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds!
25 And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?
26 If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest?
27 Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
28 But if God so clothes the grass, which is alive in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!
29 And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be worried.
30 For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them.
31 Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added to you.


32 Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
33 Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.
34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.


35 Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning,
36 and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks.
37 Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them.
38 If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants!
39 But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into.
40 You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."


41 Peter said, "Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?"
42 And the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?
43 Blessed is that servant whom his master will find doing these things when he comes.
44 Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.
45 But if that servant says to himself, ‘My master is delayed in coming,’ and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,
46 the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful.
47 And that servant who knew his master’s will but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating.
48 But the one who did not know, and did what deserves punishment, will receive a ligher punishment. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand more.


49 I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled!
50 I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how great is my distress until it is accomplished!
51 Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
52 For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three.
53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."


54 He also said to the crowds, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, ‘A shower is coming.’ And so it happens.
55 And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be scorching heat,’ and it happens.
56 You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?


57 And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?
58 As you go with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer put you in prison.
59 I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny."




Chapter 13


1 Now at that very time, some were present who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
2 And answering, he said to them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered these things?
3 No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all perish in a similar manner.
4 Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse sinners than all the other men living in Jerusalem?
5 No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all perish like they did."


6 And he told this parable: "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.
7 So he said to the gardener, 'Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down! Why should it take up space in the garden?'
8 But he answered and said to him, 'Sir, leave it alone this year too, until I dig around it and put on manure.
9 And if it bears fruit next year, fine; but if not, you can cut it down.'"


10 Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
11 And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years, and she was bent over and could not straighten up at all.
12 When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, "Woman, you are released from your infirmity."
13 And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God.
14 But the synagogue leader, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, responded and said to the crowd, "There are six days in which work ought to be done; come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day."
15 Then the Lord answered him and said, "Hypocrites! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it?
16 And this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound for eighteen years, ought she not to have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?"
17 And as he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame, and all the crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things being done by him.


18 Therefore, he said, "What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it?
19 It is like a mustard seed that a man took and threw into his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches."


20 And again he said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
21 It is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until it was all leavened."


22 And he journeyed through towns and villages, teaching and making his way toward Jerusalem.
23 And someone said to him, "Lord, are there few who are being saved?" And he said to them,
24 "Strive to enter through the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.
25 Once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer and say to you, 'I do not know where you come from.'
26 Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'
27 And he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you practitioners of unrighteousness.'
28 There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.
29 And they will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God.
30 And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last."


31 At that very hour, some Pharisees came up, saying to him, "Get out and escape from here, for Herod wants to kill you."
32 And he said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish my course.
33 Nevertheless, I must journey today and tomorrow and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem.'
34 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!
35 Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And I tell you, you will not see me until the time comes when you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"




Chapter 14


1 Now it happened that Jesus went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, and they were watching him closely.
2 And behold, there was a certain man before him who had severe edema.
3 And Jesus, responding, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?”
4 But they remained silent. And taking hold of him, he healed him and sent him away.
5 And he said to them, “Which of you, if his son or ox falls into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?”
6 And they were unable to respond to this.


7 Then he began to tell a parable to those who had been invited, noticing how they were choosing the places of honor, saying to them,
8 “When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you has been invited by him,
9 and the one who invited you both comes and says to you, ‘Give this man your place,’ and then in shame you begin to take the lowest place.
10 But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when the one who invited you comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will have honor in the presence of all those reclining with you.
11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”


12 Then he also said to the one who had invited him, “When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not call your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return, and you already receive your payback.
13 Instead, when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,
14 and you will be blessed, because they do not have the means to repay you; for it will be repaid to you at the resurrection of the righteous.”


15 Now when one of those reclining with him heard these things, he said to him, “Blessed is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!”
16 But he said to him, “A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many,
17 and at the time of the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’
18 But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it; I beg of you to excuse me.’
19 And another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them; I beg of you to excuse me.’
20 And another said, ‘I have married a wife, and because of this I cannot come.’
21 And the servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and invite the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’
22 And the servant said, ‘Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.’
23 And the master said to the servant, ‘Go out into the highways and hedges and compel more to come in, so that my house may be filled.
24 For I say to you that none of those men who were invited will taste my banquet.’”


25 Now great crowds were following him, and turning, he said to them,
26 “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.
27 Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.
28 For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?
29 Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,
30 saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’
31 Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet the one coming against him with twenty thousand?
32 And if not, while the other is still far off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.
33 So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.


34 Salt is good, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?
35 It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”




Chapter 15


1 Now all the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to him to hear him.
2 And the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling, saying, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."
3 So he told them this parable, saying,
4 "What man among you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it?
5 And when he finds it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
6 And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.'
7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous men who have no need of repentance.


8 Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?
9 And when she finds it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I lost.'
10 In the same way, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents."


11 And he said, "A certain man had two sons.
12 And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the property that falls to me.' And he divided his livelihood between them.
13 And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and journeyed to a distant country, and there he squandered his means on reckless living.
14 And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need.
15 So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
16 And he was longing to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, and no one gave him anything.
17 But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing here with hunger!
18 I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.
19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants."'


20 And he arose and went to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.
21 And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'
22 But the father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.
23 And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate.
24 For this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' And they began to celebrate.


25 Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
26 And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.
27 And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.'
28 But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him,
29 but he answered his father, 'Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat that I might celebrate with my friends.
30 But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!'
31 And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.
32 It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead and is alive; he was lost and is found.'"




Chapter 16


1 And he was also saying to the disciples, “There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this steward was accused before him of squandering his possessions.
2 And calling him, he said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be my steward.’
3 And the steward said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg.
4 I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from the stewardship, others might welcome me into their houses.’
5 And summoning each one of his master’s debtors, he was saying to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’
6 And he said, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ And he said to him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.’
7 Then to another he said, ‘And you, how much do you owe?’ And he said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He says to him, ‘Take your bill and write eighty.’
8 And the master praised the unrighteous steward because he acted shrewdly, for the sons of this age are more prudent than the sons of light in dealing with their own generation.
9 And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.


10 He who is faithful in very little is faithful also in much, and he who is unrighteous in very little is unrighteous also in much.
11 If, therefore, you have not been faithful with the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?
12 And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?
13 No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.”


14 Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things and were scoffing at him.
15 And he said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts; for what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
16 The Law and the Prophets lasted until John; from then on, the kingdom of God is being proclaimed, and every man is striving to enter into it.
17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of the Law to fail.


18 Every man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.


19 Now there was a certain rich man, and he was dressing in purple and fine linen, enjoying himself splendidly every day.
20 And a certain poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores,
21 and longing to be fed with the crumbs falling from the rich man’s table; even the dogs were coming and licking his sores.
22 And it happened that the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried.
23 And in Hades, lifting up his eyes, being in torment, he sees Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom.
24 And crying out, he said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.’
25 But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you received your good things during your lifetime, and Lazarus likewise the bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.
26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to cross from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross from there to us.’
27 And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my father’s house—
28 for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’
29 But Abraham says, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’
30 And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’
31 And he said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded even if someone could rise from the dead.’”




Chapter 17


1 Now he said to his disciples, “It’s inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the one through whom they come!
2 It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble.
3 Watch yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.
4 And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns back to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”


5 The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”
6 And the Lord said, “If you had faith like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.


7 Which one of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, would say to him when he comes in from the field, ‘Come at once and sit down to eat’?
8 Wouldn’t you rather say to him, ‘Prepare something for me to eat, and get yourself ready and serve me until I’ve eaten and drunk, and afterward you can eat and drink’?
9 Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded?
10 So you too, when you’ve done everything commanded of you, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we’ve only done what we were supposed to do.’”


11 And it happened that as he was traveling to Jerusalem, he was passing between Samaria and Galilee.
12 As he entered a certain village, ten men with leprosy met him, who stood at a distance.
13 They raised their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”
14 When he saw them, he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed.
15 One of them, seeing that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.
16 He fell on his face at his feet, giving him thanks—and this man was a Samaritan.
17 Jesus responded, saying, “Weren’t ten cleansed? Where are the nine?
18 Was no one found to return and give glory to God except this foreigner?”
19 And he said to him, “Stand up and go; your faith has saved you.”


20 Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, “The kingdom of God doesn’t come with observation,
21 nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There it is!’ For behold, the kingdom of God is among you.”


22 Then he said to the disciples, “The days will come when you’ll long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you won’t see it.
23 They’ll say to you, ‘Look there!’ or ‘Look here!’ Don’t go off or chase after them.
24 For just as lightning flashes from one part of the sky and shines to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day.
25 But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
26 And just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man:
27 they were eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage until the day Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
28 Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot—they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building—
29 but on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all.
30 It will be the same way on the day the Son of Man is revealed.


31 On that day, let the man on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away, and likewise let the man in the field not turn back.
32 Remember Lot’s wife.
33 Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses it will preserve it.
34 I tell you, on that night there will be two men in one bed—one will be taken, and the other will be left.
35 Two women will be grinding together—one will be taken, and the other will be left.”
36 []
37 They answered and said to him, “Where, Lord?” And he said to them, “Where the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.”




Chapter 18


1 And he told them a parable to show that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.
2 He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man.
3 And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’
4 For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man,
5 yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not wear me out by her continual coming.’”
6 And the Lord said, “Hear what the unrighteous judge says.
7 And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them?
8 I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”


9 He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others:
10 “Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
11 The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
12 I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’
13 But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’
14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”


15 Now they were bringing even infants to him, that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
16 But Jesus called them to him, saying, “Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.
17 Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”


18 And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
19 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.
20 You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’”
21 And he said, “All these I have kept from my youth.”
22 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”
23 But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.
24 Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, “How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!
25 For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”
26 Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”
27 But he said, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.”
28 And Peter said, “See, we have left our homes and followed you.”
29 And he said to them, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
30 who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.”


31 And taking the twelve, he said to them, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.
32 For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon.
33 And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.”
34 But they understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.


35 As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
36 And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant.
37 They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”
38 And he cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
39 And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
40 And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,
41 “What do you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, let me recover my sight.”
42 And Jesus said to him, “Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.”
43 And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the men, when they saw it, gave praise to God.




Chapter 19


1 As he entered Jericho and was passing through,
2 a man named Zacchaeus was there. He was a chief tax collector and was rich.
3 He was trying to see who Jesus was, but he couldn’t because of the crowd, since he was short in stature.
4 So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was about to pass that direction.
5 When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today."
6 So he hurried down and welcomed him joyfully.
7 When they saw it, all the men grumbled, saying, "He has gone to stay with a sinful man."
8 But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, I am giving half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone out of anything, I am paying it back four times over."
9 Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man is also a son of Abraham.
10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."


11 While they were listening to these things, he went on to tell a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.
12 So he said, "A nobleman went into a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself and then return.
13 He called ten of his servants, gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Do business with these until I come back.'
14 But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.' 
15 When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered those servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, so he could find out what they had gained by doing business.
16 The first came forward and said, 'Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.'
17 He said to him, 'Well done, good servant! Because you were faithful in a very small matter, take charge over ten cities.'
18 The second came and said, 'Lord, your mina has made five minas.'
19 He said to him also, 'And you, be over five cities.'
20 Another came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I kept stored away in a cloth.
21 For I was afraid of you, because you are a strict man. You take what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.'
22 He said to him, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant. You knew that I am a strict man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?
23 Why then did you not put my money in the bank, so that when I returned I might have collected it with interest?'
24 And he said to those standing by, 'Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.'
25 They said to him, 'Lord, he already has ten minas!'
26 'I tell you,' he replied, 'to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.
27 But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them in front of me.'"


28 After saying these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
29 When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,
30 saying, "Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter, you will find a colt tied there, on which no man has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.
31 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say this: 'The Lord needs it.'"
32 Those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.
33 As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
34 They said, "The Lord needs it."
35 They brought it to Jesus, threw their garments on the colt, and set Jesus on it.
36 As he went along, men spread their garments on the road.


37 As he was drawing near, already at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,
38 saying, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"
39 Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples."
40 He answered, "I tell you, if these men are silent, the stones will cry out."


41 When he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it,
42 saying, "If you had known, even you, on this day, the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.
43 For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build a barricade around you and surround you and press you in on every side.
44 They will dash you to the ground, and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation."


45 He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling,
46 saying to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers."
47 He was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the leading men of the people were seeking to destroy him,
48 but they could not find anything they might do, for all the men were hanging on his words.




Chapter 20


1 One day, as Jesus was teaching the crowd in the temple and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the scribes, along with the elders, approached him.
2 They said to him, “Tell us by what authority you are doing these things, or who it is that gave you this authority.”
3 He answered them, “I will also ask you a question. Tell me:
4 The baptism of John—was it from heaven, or from man?”
5 They discussed it among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’
6 But if we say, ‘From man,’ all the crowd will stone us, because they are convinced that John was a prophet.”
7 So they answered that they did not know where it came from.
8 And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”


9 He began to tell the crowd this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenants, and went away for a long time.
10 At the proper time, he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the vineyard’s fruit. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
11 He sent another servant, but they beat him too, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
12 He sent a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.
13 Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’
14 But when the tenants saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, so the inheritance will be ours.’
15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
16 He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” When they heard this, they said, “May it never be!”
17 But he looked at them and said, “What then is this that is written: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?
18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.”


19 The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they knew he had spoken this parable against them, but they feared the crowd.
20 So they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, hoping to catch him in something he said, so they could hand him over to the governor’s authority and jurisdiction.
21 They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and you do not show partiality, but teach the way of God in truth.
22 Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”
23 But he perceived their craftiness and said to them,
24 “Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?” They said, “Caesar’s.”
25 He said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”
26 They were unable to trap him in what he said in front of the crowd, and marveling at his answer, they fell silent.


27 Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and questioned him,
28 saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
29 Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife and died childless.
30 The second
31 and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died.
32 Afterward, the woman also died.
33 In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as a wife.”
34 Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,
35 but those who are considered worthy to attain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,
36 for they cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
37 But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
38 Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him.”
39 Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you have spoken well.”
40 For they no longer dared to ask him any question.


41 But he said to them, “How can they say that the Christ is David’s son?
42 For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand,
43 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’
44 David thus calls him Lord, so how is he his son?”


45 In the hearing of all the crowd, he said to his disciples,
46 “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,
47 who devour widows’ houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”




Chapter 21


1 As Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,
2 and he also saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins.
3 He said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them,
4 for they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on."


5 While some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, he said,
6 "As for these things that you see, the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down."
7 They asked him, "Teacher, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?"
8 He replied, "Watch out that you are not deceived, for many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them.
9 When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately."


10 Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
11 There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues; there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.
12 But before all this, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name.
13 This will be your opportunity to bear witness.
14 Settle it in your hearts, therefore, not to prepare beforehand how to defend yourselves,
15 for I will give you a mouth and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict.
16 You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends, and they will put some of you to death.
17 You will be hated by all men because of my name,
18 but not a hair of your head will perish.
19 By your endurance you will gain your lives."


20 "When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near.
21 Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city depart, and let not those in the country enter it,
22 for these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written.
23 Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days, for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath against this people.
24 They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled."


25 "There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves,
26 men fainting from fear and the expectation of what is coming on the inhabited world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
27 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
28 When these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."


29 He told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
30 When they are already budding, you see for yourselves and know that summer is near.
31 So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.
32 Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place.
33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."


34 "Be on guard, lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap,
35 for it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth.
36 But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place and to stand before the Son of Man."


37 During the day he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out and lodged on the mount called Olivet.
38 And early in the morning all the men came to him in the temple to hear him.




Chapter 22


1 Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was drawing near.
2 The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put him to death, because they feared the crowd.


3 Then Satan entered into Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve.
4 He went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them.
5 They were delighted and agreed to give him silver.
6 He consented and began seeking an opportunity to betray him to them away from the crowd.


7 The day of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
8 Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it."
9 They said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare it?"
10 He said to them, "Look, when you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters.
11 Say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"'
12 He will show you a large furnished upper room. Prepare it there."
13 They went and found everything just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.


14 When the hour came, he reclined at the table, and the apostles with him.
15 He said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
16 For I tell you, I will not never again eat it until its fulfillment in the kingdom of God."
17 Taking a cup, he gave thanks and said, "Take this and divide it among yourselves.
18 For I tell you, from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
19 Taking bread, he gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
20 Likewise, he took the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup, poured out for you, is the new covenant in my blood.
21 But look, the hand of the one betraying me is with me on the table.
22 For the Son of Man will die as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!"
23 They began to question among themselves which of them it could be who was going to do this.


24 A dispute also arose among them about which of them was considered the greatest.
25 He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors.
26 But not so with you. Rather, let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and the leader like the one who serves.
27 For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as the one who serves.
28 You are those who have remained with me in my trials.
29 I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,
30 so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.


31 "Simon, Simon, look, Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat.
32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. And that when you have turned yourself back around, you may strengthen your brothers."
33 He said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death."
34 He said, "I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know me."


35 He said to them, "When I sent you out without a moneybag, a knapsack, or sandals, did you lack anything?" They said, "Nothing."
36 He said to them, "But now, let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one.
37 For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors.' For what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment."
38 They said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." He said to them, "It is enough."


39 Going out, he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.
40 When he arrived at the place, he said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."
41 He withdrew from them about a stone's throw, knelt down, and began to pray,
42 saying, "Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."
43 An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
44 Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling to the ground.
45 Rising from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow.
46 He said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not enter into temptation."


47 While he was still speaking, look, a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him.
48 But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
49 When those around him saw what was about to happen, they said, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"
50 One of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
51 But Jesus responded, "Stop! No more of this!" And he touched his ear and healed him.
52 Jesus said to the chief priests, officers of the temple, and elders who had come against him, "Have you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber?
53 When I was with you every day in the temple, you did not stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."


54 Seizing him, they led him away and brought him into the high priest's house while Peter was following at a distance.
55 When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.
56 A servant girl, seeing him sitting in the light, looked closely at him, and said, "This man was with him too."
57 But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."
58 A little later, someone else saw him and said, "You are one of them too." But Peter said, "Man, I am not."
59 After about an hour had passed, another man insisted, saying, "Certainly this man was with him, for he is a Galilean too."
60 But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about." Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
61 Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter, who remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before a rooster crows today, you will deny me three times."
62 And he went out and wept bitterly.


63 The men who were holding Jesus began mocking and beating him.
64 They blindfolded him and kept asking, "Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?"
65 They were saying many other things against him, blaspheming.


66 When day came, the council of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him into their council, saying,
67 "If you are the Christ, tell us." But he said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe,
68 and if I ask you, you will not answer.
69 But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God."
70 They all said, "Are you the Son of God, then?" He said to them, "You say that I am."
71 They said, "What further testimony do we need? For we have heard it for ourselves from his own mouth."




Chapter 23


1 Now the whole assembly rose up and led him to Pilate.
2 They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man subverting our nation, opposing the payment of taxes to Caesar, and claiming that he himself is Christ, a king."
3 Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" He answered him, "You say so."
4 Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no guilt in this man."
5 But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place."


6 When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
7 Upon learning that he belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him because he had heard about him and was hoping to see some sign performed by him.
9 He questioned him at length, but he gave him no answer.
10 The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.
11 Herod, along with his soldiers, treated him with contempt and mocked him. After dressing him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate.
12 That very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other, for previously  they had been enemies.


13 Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,
14 and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people, and after examining him before you, I found no guilt in him regarding the charges you bring against him.
15 Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him.
16 I will therefore punish him and release him."
17 []
18 But they all cried out together, "Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas"—
19 a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and for murder.
20 Pilate addressed them again, wanting to release Jesus,
21 but they kept shouting, "Crucify, crucify him!"
22 A third time he said to them, "Why? What evil has he done? I have found in him no guilt deserving death. I will therefore punish him and release him."
23 But they were urgent, demanding with loud voices that he be crucified, and their voices prevailed.


24 Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.
25 He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for, but he delivered Jesus over to them.
26 As they led him away, they seized a man named Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry it behind Jesus.
27 A large crowd of the people followed him, including women who were mourning and lamenting for him.
28 But turning to them, Jesus said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
29 For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’
30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’
31 For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?"


32 Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him.
33 Then they came to the place called the Skull, and crucified him there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
34 Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they cast lots to divide his garments.
35 The people stood watching, and the rulers scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!"
36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine
37 and saying, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!"
38 There was also an inscription over him: "This is the king of the Jews."


39 One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!"
40 But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
41 We indeed are justly condemned, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."
42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
43 He said to him, "Today I tell you the truth, you will be with me in paradise."


44 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,
45 for the sun’s light failed. The curtain of the temple was torn in two.
46 Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" Having said this, he breathed his last.
47 When the centurion saw what had taken place, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this man was righteous."
48 All the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, returned home beating their breasts.
49 All his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things.


50 Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea, a member of the council, a good and righteous man,
51 who had not consented to their decision and action. He was waiting for the kingdom of God.
52 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
53 Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen shroud, and laid him in a tomb cut in stone, where no one had yet been buried.
54 It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning.
55 The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.
56 Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.




Chapter 24


1 Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.
2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
3 and when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
4 While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling garments.
5 The women were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?
6 He is not here, but he has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,
7 that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified, and on the third day rise again?"
8 And they remembered his words.


9 Returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
10 Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles.
11 But these words seemed to them like nonsense, and they did not believe them.
12 But Peter rose and ran to the tomb, and stooping to look in, he saw only the linen cloths. He went away to his home, wondering about what had happened.


13 Now behold, on that same day, two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem,
14 and they were talking with each other about all these things that had taken place.
15 While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself drew near and began walking with them,
16 but their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
17 He said to them, "What are these matters you are discussing with each other as you walk?" And they stood still, looking sad.
18 One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"
19 He said to them, "What things?" They replied, "The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in deed and word before God, and all the people,
20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
21 But we were hoping that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.
22 Moreover, some women from our group amazed us; they were at the tomb early this morning
23 and did not find his body. They came saying that they had even seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.
24 Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see his body."


25 He said to them, "O foolish men and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
26 Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into his glory?"
27 And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them the things concerning himself in all the Scriptures.


28 They drew near to the village where they were going, and he acted as though he were going farther.
29 But they urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent." So he went in to stay with them.
30 When he reclined at table with them, he took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them.
31 Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished from their sight.
32 They said to each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us on the road, while he opened the Scriptures to us?"


33 They rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven gathered together with those who were with them,
34 saying, "The Lord has risen indeed and has appeared to Simon!"
35 Then they recounted what had happened on the road and how he revealed himself to them in the breaking of the bread.


36 While they were saying these things, he himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace to you."
37 But they were startled and frightened, thinking they were seeing a spirit.
38 He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
39 Look at my hands and my feet. It is I. Touch me and see, for a spirit would not have flesh and bones as you see I have."
40 And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
41 While they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"
42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
43 and he took it and ate it before them.


44 Then he said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."
45 Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
46 and he said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead,
47 and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
48 You are witnesses of these things.
49 And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you, but stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."


50 He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them. 
51 While he was blessing them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven.
52 And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
53 and they were continually in the temple blessing God.﻿The Gospel of John


Chapter 1


1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
2 This Word was in the beginning with God.
3 All things came into being through him, and apart from him not one thing was created, which has been created.
4 In him was life, and that life is the light of man.
5 And the light shone in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.


6 There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.
7 This man came as a witness, to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.
8 He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light,
9 that the true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.


10 He was in the world, and the world came into being through him, yet the world did not know him.
11 He came to his own people, but even his own people did not receive him.
12 But to all who did receive him, and who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,
13 who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a man, but of God.
14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.


15 John testified about him and cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘The one coming after me is greater than me, because he existed before me.’”
16 For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.
17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
18 No one has ever seen God; however, the only-born God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known.


19 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”
20 He confessed and did not deny, but admitted, “I am not the Christ.”
21 So they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”
22 Then they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
23 He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.”
24 And those who had been sent from the Pharisees
25 asked him, “Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
26 John answered them, saying, “While I baptize with water, among you stands one whom you do not know:
27 the one coming after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”  


28 These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
29 The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
30 This is the one of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is greater than me, because he existed before me.’
31 I myself did not know him, but I came baptizing with water, for the purpose of revealing him to Israel.”


32 And John testified, saying, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.
33 I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘The one on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’
34 And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”


35 The next day John was standing with two of his disciples,
36 and seeing Jesus walking by, he said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”
37 The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.


38 Jesus turned and saw them following him and said to them, “What are you seeking?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?”
39 He said to them, “Come and you will see.” So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
40 One of the two who heard John and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
41 He first sought out his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ).
42 He brought him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, “You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).


43 The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”
44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found the one of whom Moses wrote about, in the Law and the prophets: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”
46 Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”
47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!”
48 Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”
49 Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”
50 Jesus answered and said to him, “Do you believe because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree?’ You will see greater things than these.”
51 And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”




Chapter 2


1 On the third day, a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
2 Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.
3 When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.”
4 Jesus said to her, “What does this have to do with me, woman? My hour has not yet come.”
5 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”


6 Now there were six stone water jars standing there, according to the Jewish purification customs, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.
7 Jesus said to them, “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.
8 Then he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.” And they did as Jesus requested.
9 When the master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, not knowing where it came from—though the servants who had drawn the water knew—the master of the feast called the bridegroom
10 and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the cheaper wine after the guests have drunk freely. But you have kept the good wine until now.”
11 This, the first of his signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.


12 After this, he went down to Capernaum with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.


13 The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
14 In the temple, he found people selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and the money-changers sitting there.
15 Making a whip out of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, along with the sheep and the oxen, and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.
16 To those selling doves, he said, “Take these things out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house into a marketplace!”
17 His disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”


18 Then the Jews responded to him, saying, “What sign can you show us, since you’re doing these things?”
19 Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”
20 The Jews said, “This temple took forty-six years to build, and you’ll raise it up in three days?”
21 But he was speaking about the temple of his body.
22 So when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.


23 While he was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the festival, many believed in his name because they saw the miracles he was performing.
24 But Jesus himself did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people,
25 and he had no need for anyone to testify about man, for he himself knew what was in a person.




Chapter 3


1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
2 This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one can perform these signs that you do unless God is with him.”
3 Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”
4 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”
5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
7 Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’
8 The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”


9 Nicodemus answered and said to him, “How can these things happen?”
10 Jesus answered and said to him, “You are a teacher in Israel, and you do not know these things?
11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen, yet you do not accept our testimony.
12 If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how would you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
13 No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven—the Son of Man.
14 And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
15 so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.


16 For God loved the world so much, that He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but have eternal life.
17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him.
18 The one who believes in him is not condemned, but the one who does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.
19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, but people loved [to stay in] the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.
20 For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds be exposed.
21 But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, so that it may be evident that his deeds have been done in God.”


22 After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he stayed there with them and was baptizing.
23 John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized—
24 for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
25 Then a dispute arose between some of John’s disciples and a Jew concerning purification.
26 And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, about whom you testified—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.”
27 John answered and said, “A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given to him from heaven.
28 You yourselves witness that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but ‘I have been sent ahead of him.’
29 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom; the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore, this joy of mine has been made complete.
30 He must increase, but I must decrease."


31 The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.
32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony.
33 The one who has accepted his testimony has certified that God is true.
34 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.
35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.
36 The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God remains on him.




Chapter 4


1 Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John—
2 although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were—
3 he left Judea and departed again for Galilee.
4 But he had to pass through Samaria.
5 So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
6 Jacob’s well was there, so Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon.


7 A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.”
8 For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.
9 The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
10 Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”
11 The woman said to him, “Lord, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get this living water from?
12 Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?”
13 Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,
14 but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”
15 The woman said to him, “Lord, give me this water, so that I won’t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”


16 He said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come back here.”
17 The woman answered, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband,’
18 for you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true.”
19 The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.
20 Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.”
21 Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.
22 You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.
23 But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.
24 God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”
25 The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (the one called Christ). When he comes, he will explain everything to us.”
26 Jesus said to her, “I AM he, the one speaking to you.”


27 Just then his disciples returned and were amazed that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”
28 So the woman left her water jar, went back to the town, and said to the people,
29 “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?”
30 They left the town and were coming to him.


31 Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi, eat something.”
32 But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”
33 So the disciples said to one another, “Has someone brought him something to eat?”
34 Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to complete his work.
35 Don’t you say, ‘There are still four months, and then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes and see that the fields are already white for harvest.
36 The one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.
37 For in this the saying is true: ‘One sows and another reaps.’
38 I sent you to reap what you did not labor for; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”


39 Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony: “He told me everything I ever did.”
40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.
41 And many more believed because of his word.
42 They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this is truly the Savior of the world.”


43 After the two days, he departed from there and went to Galilee.
44 For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.
45 When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the festival, for they too had been at the festival.


46 So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son was sick in Capernaum.
47 When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.
48 Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will not believe.”
49 The royal official said to him, “Lord, come down before my child dies.”
50 Jesus said to him, “Go, your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started on his way.
51 As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was alive.
52 So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, “Yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him.”
53 The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son lives.” And he himself believed, along with his whole household.
54 This was now the second sign that Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.




Chapter 5


1 After this, there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
2 Now in Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, there is a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew, which has five covered walkways.
3 In these lay a large number of sick people—blind, lame, and paralyzed.
4 [waiting for the moving of the water, because an angel of the Lord would come down at certain times into the pool and stir the water; whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease they had. (Some early manuscripts do not include this verse.)]
5 A certain man was there who had been afflicted with his sickness for thirty-eight years.
6 When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been in that condition for a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to be made well?"
7 The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I’m trying to get there, someone else goes down ahead of me."
8 Jesus said to him, "Get up, take your mat, and walk."
9 Immediately the man became well, took up his mat, and started walking. Now, that day was a Sabbath.


10 So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It’s the Sabbath, and it’s not lawful for you to carry your mat."
11 But he answered them, "The one who made me well told me, ‘Take your mat and walk.’"
12 They asked him, "Who is the man who told you, ‘Take it and walk’?"
13 But the one who was healed didn’t know who it was, because Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.


14 Later, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, "Look, you’ve been made well. Stop sinning, or something worse might happen to you."
15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
16 Because of this, the Jews began persecuting Jesus, since he was doing these things on the Sabbath.
17 But Jesus answered them, "My Father is still working, and I’m working too."
18 For this reason, the Jews were even more determined to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.


19 So Jesus responded and said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.
20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he himself is doing. And he will show him even greater works than these, so that you’ll be amazed.
21 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes.
22 Moreover, the Father doesn’t judge anyone, but he has entrusted all judgment to the Son,
23 so that everyone may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him.
24 Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes the one who sent me has eternal life and doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.


25 Truly, truly, I tell you, an hour is coming—and is now here—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
26 For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself too.
27 And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.
28 Don’t be astonished at this, because an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice
29 and come out—those who have done good to a resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to a resurrection of judgment.


30 I can’t do anything on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I don’t seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me.
31 If I testify about myself, my testimony isn’t valid.
32 There’s someone else who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony he gives about me is true.
33 You sent messengers to John, and he has testified to the truth.
34 Not that I accept human testimony, but I mention it so that you might be saved.
35 He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
36 But I have a greater testimony than John’s: the works that the Father has given me to complete—the very works I’m doing—testify about me that the Father has sent me.
37 And the Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You’ve never heard his voice or seen his form,
38 nor does his word remain in you, because you don’t believe the one he sent.
39 You are searching the Scriptures because you are thinking to have eternal life through them, but these [scriptures] point to me;
40 and yet you’re unwilling to come to me so that you may have life.


41 I don’t accept glory from people,
42 but I know you—that you don’t have the love of God in yourselves.
43 I’ve come in my Father’s name, and you don’t accept me; if someone else comes in his own name, you’ll accept him.
44 How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and don’t seek the glory that comes from the only God?
45 Don’t think that I’ll accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, on whom you’ve set your hope.
46 For if you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me.
47 But if you don’t believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"




Chapter 6


1 After this, Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also called the Sea of Tiberias.
2 A large crowd followed him because they saw the miracles he was performing on those who were sick.
3 Jesus went up on a mountain and sat down there with his disciples.
4 Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.
5 When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, “Where are we going to buy bread so these people can eat?”
6 He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he was going to do.
7 Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread wouldn’t be enough for each of them to get even a little.”
8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him,
9 “There’s a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are they for so many people?”
10 Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” There was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, about five thousand in number.
11 Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated, as much as they wanted, and he did the same with the fish.
12 When they were full, he told his disciples, “Gather up the leftover pieces so nothing is wasted.”
13 So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with pieces from the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
14 When the people saw the miracle he had done, they said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.”
15 Realizing they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.


16 When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
17 got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
18 The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing.
19 After they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were afraid.
20 But he said to them, “It is I; don’t be afraid.”
21 Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land where they were heading.


22 The next day, the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with his disciples, but his disciples had gone away alone.
23 Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
24 So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum looking for Jesus.


25 When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”
26 Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, you’re looking for me not because you saw miracles, but because you ate the loaves and were satisfied.
27 Don’t work for the food that perishes, but for the food that lasts into eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you, for God the Father has set his seal on him.”
28 Then they said to him, “What must we do to perform the works of God?”
29 Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God: that you believe in the one he has sent.”
30 So they said to him, “What sign are you going to do then, so we can see and believe you? What are you going to perform?
31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”
32 Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it wasn’t Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
33 For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”
34 They said to him, “Lord, give us this bread always.”


35 Jesus said to them, “I AM the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never hunger, and whoever believes in me will never thirst.
36 But I told you that you’ve seen me and still don’t believe.
37 Everyone the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.
38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of the one who sent me.
39 And this is the will of the one who sent me: that I should lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up on the last day.
40 For this is the will of my Father: that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day.”


41 Then the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”
42 They were saying, “Isn’t this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”
43 Jesus answered them, “Stop grumbling among yourselves.
44 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up on the last day.
45 It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me—
46 not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.
47 Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever believes has eternal life.
48 I AM the bread of life.
49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness and died.
50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.
51 I AM the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”


52 The Jews then argued fiercely among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
53 So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day.
55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.
57 Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.
58 This is the bread that came down from heaven—not like the bread the ancestors ate and died. Whoever eats this bread will live forever.”
59 He said these things while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.


60 Many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, “This is a hard teaching; who can accept it?”
61 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, “Does this offend you?
62 What if you see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?
63 It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life.
64 But there are some of you who don’t believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who didn’t believe and who would betray him.
65 And he said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted to them by the Father.”


66 From that time on, many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.
67 So Jesus said to the Twelve, “You don’t want to leave too, do you?”
68 Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.
69 We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.”
70 Jesus replied to them, “Didn’t I choose you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.”
71 He was speaking about Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the Twelve, was going to betray him.




Chapter 7


1 After this, Jesus was traveling around in Galilee, for he did not want to travel in Judea because the Jewish leaders were seeking to kill him.
2 Now the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was approaching.
3 So his brothers said to him, "Leave this place and go to Judea, so your disciples can see the works you’re doing.
4 For no one does anything in secret while trying to be known publicly. If you’re doing these things, show yourself to the world."
5 For even his brothers did not believe in him.
6 Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always at hand.
7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it—that its works are evil.
8 You go up to the festival; I’m not going up to this festival yet, because my time has not yet come."
9 After saying this, he remained in Galilee.


10 But after his brothers had gone up to the festival, then he also went up—not publicly, but in private.
11 The Jewish leaders were looking for him at the festival and saying, "Where is he?"
12 There was a lot of whispering about him among the crowds. Some were saying, "He’s a good man," while others were saying, "No, he’s deceiving the people."
13 Still, no one spoke openly about him because they feared the Jewish leaders.


14 When the festival was already half over, Jesus went up to the temple and began to teach.
15 The Jewish leaders were amazed and said, "How does this man know so much without having been educated?"
16 Jesus answered them, "My teaching isn’t my own, but it comes from the one who sent me.
17 If anyone wants to do his will, they’ll know whether my teaching is from God or if I’m speaking on my own.
18 The one who speaks on their own seeks their own glory, but the one who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is true, and there’s no unrighteousness in him.
19 Didn’t Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?"
20 The crowd answered, "You have a demon! Who’s trying to kill you?"
21 Jesus replied, "I did one work, and you’re all astonished.
22 Moses gave you circumcision—not that it’s from Moses, but from the forefathers—and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses isn’t broken, why are you angry with me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?
24 Don’t judge by appearances, but judge with righteous judgment."


25 Then some of the people from Jerusalem started saying, "Isn’t this the one they’re trying to kill?
26 Yet here he is, speaking publicly, and they’re saying nothing to him. Could it be that the rulers actually know this is the Messiah?
27 But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he’s from."
28 So Jesus, while teaching in the temple, cried out, "You know me, and you know where I’m from? I haven’t come on my own, but the one who sent me is true, and you don’t know him.
29 I know him because I’m from him, and he sent me."
30 Then they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.
31 Yet many among the people believed in him and said, "When the Messiah comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?"


32 The Pharisees heard the people muttering these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.
33 Jesus then said, "I’m with you for a little while longer, and then I’m going to the one who sent me.
34 You’ll look for me, but you won’t find me, and where I am, you cannot come."
35 The Jewish leaders said to one another, "Where’s this man about to go that we won’t find him? Is he going to the Jewish Diaspora among the Greeks and to teach the Greeks?
36 What’s this statement he made: ‘You’ll look for me, but you won’t find me, and where I am, you cannot come’?"


37 On the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let them come to me and drink.
38 The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of their heart will flow rivers of living water.’"
39 He said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were about to receive, for the Spirit had not yet been given because Jesus had not yet been glorified.


40 Some of the people, after hearing these words, said, "This is truly the Prophet."
41 Others said, "This is the Messiah." But some said, "The Messiah doesn’t come from Galilee, does he?
42 Doesn’t the Scripture say that the Messiah comes from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"
43 So a division arose among the people because of him.
44 Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.


45 Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, "Why didn’t you bring him?"
46 The officers answered, "No one ever spoke like this man!"
47 The Pharisees responded, "Have you been deceived too?
48 Has any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in him?
49 But this crowd, which doesn’t know the law, is cursed."
50 Nicodemus, the one who had come to Jesus earlier and was one of them, said to them,
51 "Does our law judge a man without first hearing from him and knowing what he’s doing?"
52 They replied, "Are you from Galilee too? Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee."


[The Pericope Adulterae passage from John 7:53 to 8:11 is of doubtful origin.]
53 Then each one went to their own home.




Chapter 8


1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
2 Early in the morning, he came again to the temple. All the people were coming to him, and he sat down and began to teach them.
3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and placing her in the middle,
4 they said to him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery.
5 Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?”
6 They said this to test him, so they might have something to accuse him of. But Jesus bent down and started writing on the ground with his finger.
7 When they kept questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let the one among you who is without sin throw the first stone at her.”
8 Then he bent down again and continued writing on the ground.
9 When they heard this, they began to leave one by one, starting with the older ones, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.
10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”
11 She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go, and from now on, sin no more.”


[End of Pericope Adulterae passage. Most early manuscripts do not contain John 7:53 to 8:11. Those early manuscripts that do contain it mark the passage as if it were added. The earliest known references to the story are from the apocryphal Gospel of the Hebrews. In addition, the stylisms and usage of the Greek language in the text is inconsistent with that of John’s writing. However, the passage is included here for historical purposes.]


12 Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life.”
13 The Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying about yourself; your testimony is not valid.”
14 Jesus answered them, “Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going.
15 You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
16 Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.
17 Even in your own Law it is written that the testimony of two people is valid.
18 Although I testify about myself, the Father who sent me also testifies about me.”
19 Then they said to him, “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”
20 He spoke these words while teaching in the treasury, within the temple, but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.


21 Then he said to them again, “I am going away, and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”
22 So the Jews said, “Will he kill himself, since he says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”
23 He said to them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
24 I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.”
25 They said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “Just what I have been telling you from the beginning.
26 I have much to say about you and much to judge, but the one who sent me is true, and what I have heard from him, I speak to the world.”  
27 They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father.  
28 So Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own, but I speak just as the Father taught me.  
29 The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I always do what pleases him.”  
30 As he was saying these things, many believed in him.


31 So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, “If you remain in my word, you are truly my disciples,  
32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”  
33 They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves to anyone. How can you say, ‘You will become free’?”  
34 Jesus replied to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who is committing sin is a slave to sin.  
35 A slave does not remain in the household forever, but a son remains forever.  
36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.  
37 I know that you are Abraham’s descendants, but you are trying to kill me because my word finds no place in you.  
38 I speak what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.”


39 They answered him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.  
40 But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.  
41 You are doing the works of your father.” They said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father—God.”  
42 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and am here. I did not come on my own, but he sent me.  
43 Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.  
44 You are of your father the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.  
45 But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.  
46 Which one of you can prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why do you not believe me?  
47 Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear them is that you are not of God.”


48 The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”  
49 Jesus replied, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.  
50 I am not seeking my own glory; there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.  
51 Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.”  
52 The Jews said to him, “Now we know you have a demon! Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet you say, ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.’  
53 Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died too! Who do you make yourself out to be?”  
54 Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’  
55 But you have not known him. I know him. If I said I did not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.  
56 Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.”  
57 So the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?”  
58 Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, before Abraham was, I AM.”  
59 Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.




Chapter 9


1 Now as he was passing by, Jesus saw a man blind from birth.
2 And his disciples asked him, saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
3 Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God might be revealed in him.
4 We must work the works of the one who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.
5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”
6 Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the mud.
7 And he said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated “Sent”). So he went away and washed, and came back seeing.


8 Then the neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, “Isn’t this the man who was sitting and begging?”
9 Some were saying, “It is him”; others were saying, “No, but he is like him.” He kept saying, “I am the one.”
10 So they were saying to him, “How, then, were your eyes opened?”
11 He answered, “The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So I went and washed and received my sight.”
12 They said to him, “Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.”


13 They brought him, the one who was formerly blind, to the Pharisees.
14 Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
15 So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.”
16 Some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man is not from God, because he does not keep the Sabbath.” But others were saying, “How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?” And there was a division among them.
17 So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?” He said, “He is a prophet.”


18 The Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the one who had received his sight.
19 And they asked them, saying, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How, then, does he now see?”
20 His parents answered and said, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind,
21 but how he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself.”
22 His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed him to be the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
23 For this reason his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”


24 So for a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, “Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.”
25 He then answered, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.”
26 They said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
27 He answered them, “I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?”
28 And they reviled him and said, “You are a disciple of that man, but we are disciples of Moses.
29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he is from.”
30 The man answered and said to them, “Well, here is an astonishing thing, that you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.
31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does his will, he listens to him.
32 Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
34 They answered and said to him, “You were completely born in sin, and are you teaching us?” And they cast him out.


35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and finding him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”
36 He answered and said, “And who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”
37 Jesus said to him, “You have both seen him, and it is he who is speaking with you.”
38 And he said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.
39 And Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.”
40 Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and said to him, “We are not blind too, are we?”
41 Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now that you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains.”




Chapter 10


1 "Truly, truly, I tell you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold through the door but climbs in some other way is a thief and a robber.
2 But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
3 The gatekeeper opens it for him, and the sheep hear his voice; he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
4 When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
5 They will never follow a stranger; instead, they will flee from him because they do not recognize the voice of strangers."
6 Jesus spoke this figure of speech to them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.


7 So Jesus said to them again, "Truly, truly, I tell you, I AM the door for the sheep.
8 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
9 I AM the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.
10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came so that they may have life and have it abundantly.


11 I AM the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
12 The hired hand, who is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and flees—and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.
13 He flees because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.
14 I AM the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me,
15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.
16 I also have other sheep that are not from this fold; I must bring them too, and they will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd.
17 For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it up again.
18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father."


19 Again, a division arose among the Jews because of these words.
20 Many of them were saying, "He has a demon and is out of his mind! Why listen to him?"
21 Others said, "These are not the words of someone possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"


22 At that time, the Feast of Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,
23 and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon.
24 So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."
25 Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me,
26 but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep.
27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
28 I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of the Father’s hand.
30 I and the Father are one."


31 The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.
32 Jesus responded to them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?"
33 The Jews answered him, "We are not stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God."
34 Jesus replied to them, "Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said, you are gods’?
35 If he called those to whom the word of God came ‘gods’—and the Scripture cannot be broken—
36 do you say of the one whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?
37 If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;
38 but if I am doing them, even if you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father."
39 Then they tried again to seize him, but he escaped from their hands.


40 He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing earlier, and he stayed there.
41 Many came to him and were saying, "John performed no sign, but everything John said about this man was true."
42 And many believed in him there.




Chapter 11


1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
2 This Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.
3 So the sisters sent word to him, saying, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”
4 When Jesus heard this, he said, “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”
5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
6 Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days.


7 Then after this, he said to the disciples, “Let’s go to Judea again.”
8 The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now trying to stone you, and you’re going back there?”
9 Jesus answered, “Aren’t there twelve hours in a day? If anyone walks during the day, they don’t stumble, because they see the light of this world.
10 But if anyone walks at night, they stumble, because the light isn’t in them.”
11 After saying this, he told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I’m going there to wake him up.”
12 The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he’s fallen asleep, he’ll recover.”
13 Now Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought he was talking about the rest of sleep.
14 So Jesus then said to them plainly, “Lazarus is dead,
15 and I’m glad for your sake that I wasn’t there, so that you may believe. But let’s go to him.”
16 Then Thomas, the one called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let’s go too, so we can die with him.”


17 When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.
18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away,
19 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them about their brother.
20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed seated in the house.
21 Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.
22 But even now, I know that whatever you ask from God, He will give you.”
23 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”
24 Martha replied, “I know he’ll rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”
25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if they die, will live,
26 and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die forever. Do you believe this?”
27 She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I’ve come to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one coming into the world.”


28 After saying this, she went back and called her sister Mary privately, saying, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”
29 When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
30 Now Jesus had not yet entered the village but was still at the place where Martha had met him.
31 The Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly and leave, so they followed her, thinking she was going to the tomb to weep there.
32 When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”
33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
34 He said, “Where have you laid him?” They replied, “Lord, come and see.”
35 Jesus wept.
36 So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!”
37 But some of them said, “Couldn’t this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have kept this man from dying?”


38 Then Jesus, again deeply moved within himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him, “Lord, by now there’s a stench—he’s been dead four days.”
40 Jesus said to her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believe, you’ll see the glory of God?”
41 So they took away the stone. Jesus lifted his eyes upward and said, “Father, I thank you that you’ve heard me.
42 I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so they may believe that you sent me.”
43 After saying this, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”
44 The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him and let him go.”


45 Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary and seen what he did believed in him.
46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees convened the council and said, “What are we going to do? This man is performing many signs.
48 If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”
49 But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all!
50 You don’t realize that it’s better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.”
51 He didn’t say this on his own, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,
52 and not only for the nation, but also to gather into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.
53 So from that day on, they plotted to kill him.


54 Jesus, therefore, no longer walked openly among the Jews but went from there to a region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and he stayed there with his disciples.
55 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the countryside before the Passover to purify themselves.
56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he won’t come to the festival at all?”
57 The chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, they should report it, so they could arrest him.




Chapter 12


1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
2 So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, while Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with him.
3 Then Mary took a pound of very expensive perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus’ feet, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said,
5 “Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?”
6 He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the money bag and used to steal what was put into it.
7 Jesus said, “Leave her alone; she has kept it for the day of my burial.
8 For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.”


9 Now a large crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
10 But the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus as well,
11 because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.


12 The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
13 So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!”
14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written,
15 “Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey’s colt!”
16 His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him and that they had done these things to him.
17 The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness.
18 This was also why the crowd went to meet him, because they heard he had performed this sign.
19 So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, the world has gone after him!”


20 Now some Greeks were among those who went up to worship at the feast.
21 They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”
22 Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.
23 Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
24 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
25 Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
26 If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.


27 “Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.
28 Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”
29 The crowd standing there heard it and said it had thundered; others said, “An angel has spoken to him.”
30 Jesus answered, “This voice has come for your sake, not mine.
31 Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
32 And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”
33 He said this to indicate the kind of death he was going to die.


34 The crowd answered him, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”
35 So Jesus said to them, “The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.
36 While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light.” After saying these things, Jesus went away and hid himself from them.


37 Though he had performed so many signs in their presence, they still did not believe in him,
38 so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: “Lord, who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
39 For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah also said,
40 “He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.”
41 Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke about him.
42 Nevertheless, many even of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue;
43 for they loved the glory that comes from men more than the glory that comes from God.


44 Jesus cried out and said, “Whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me.
45 And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.
46 I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.
47 If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.
48 The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
49 For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak.
50 And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me.”




Chapter 13


1 Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come to depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.
2 And during supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him,
3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God,
4 rose from supper, laid aside his outer garments, took a towel, and tied it around himself.
5 Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him.
6 He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”
7 Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand later.”
8 Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.”
9 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!”
10 Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not all of you.”
11 For he knew who would betray him; that was why he said, “Not all of you are clean.”


12 When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments again, he reclined at the table and said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you?
13 You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you are right, for I am.
14 If I, then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
15 For I have given you an example, that you should do just as I have done for you.
16 Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.
17 If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
18 I am not speaking about all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the Scripture: ‘The one who eats my bread has lifted his heel against me.’
19 I am telling you this now, before it happens, so that when it does happen, you may believe that I am he.
20 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.”


21 After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, “Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.”
22 The disciples looked at one another, uncertain about whom he was speaking.
23 One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining close to Jesus’ side.
24 Simon Peter motioned to him to ask who it was that he was speaking about.  
25 So that disciple, leaning close to Jesus, said to him, “Lord, who is it?”
26 Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it.” Then, having dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
27 After he took the bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, “What you are going to do, do quickly.”
28 Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.
29 Some thought that because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.
30 So, after taking the bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.


31 When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.
32 If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him at once.
33 Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I say to you, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’
34 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.
35 By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”


36 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered him, “Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.”
37 Peter said to him, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
38 Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times.”




Chapter 14


1 "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.
2 In my Father’s house there are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?
3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me, so that where I am, you may be also.
4 And you know the way to where I am going."
5 Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don’t know where you’re going. How can we know the way?"
6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
7 If you have known me, you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him."
8 Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."
9 Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still don’t know me? The one who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?
10 Don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own, but the Father who dwells in me does his works.
11 Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me—or else believe because of the works themselves.
12 Truly, truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do, and will do even greater works than these, because I am going to the Father.
13 And whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
14 If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.
15 If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to be with you forever—
17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept because it neither sees nor knows him. But you know him, because he remains with you and will be in you.
18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.
19 In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.
20 On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.
21 The one who has my commandments and keeps them is the one who loves me. And the one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and reveal myself to him."
22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, how is it that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world?"
23 Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.
24 The one who does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
25 I have said these things to you while I am still with you.
26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and remind you of all that I have said to you.
27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid.
28 You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, and I will come back to you.’ If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I.
29 And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it does happen, you may believe.
30 I will not speak with you much longer, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me,
31 but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Get up, let’s go from here."




Chapter 15


1 "I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.
2 Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he removes, and every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes so that it may bear more fruit.
3 You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
4 Remain in me, and I will remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me.
5 I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him—this one bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.
6 If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown out like a branch and withers; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned.
7 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you want, and it will be done for you.
8 By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and prove to be my disciples.
9 Just as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you; remain in my love.
10 If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love.
11 I have told you these things so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.
12 This is my commandment: that you love one another just as I have loved you.
13 No one has greater love than this, that someone would lay down his life for his friends.
14 You are my friends if you do what I command you.
15 I no longer call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, because everything I heard from my Father I have made known to you.
16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.
17 These things I command you, so that you will love one another.
18 If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you.
19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world—since I chose you out of the world—for this reason the world hates you.
20 Remember the word I spoke to you: ‘A slave is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you too; if they kept my word, they will keep yours too.
21 But they will do all these things to you because of my name, because they do not know the one who sent me.
22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
23 The one who hates me hates my Father also.
24 If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.
25 But this happened so that the word written in their Law might be fulfilled: ‘They hated me without cause.’
26 When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—he will testify about me.
27 And you also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning."




Chapter 16


1 "I’ve told you these things so you won’t stumble.
2 They’ll expel you from the synagogues; in fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they’re offering a service to God.
3 They’ll do this because they haven’t known the Father or me.
4 But I’ve said these things to you so that when their time comes, you’ll remember that I warned you about them. I didn’t tell you this at first because I was with you.


5 “But now I’m going to the one who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
6 Instead, because I’ve said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts.
7 But I’m telling you the truth: it’s better for you that I go away. If I don’t go, the Advocate won’t come to you; but if I do go, I’ll send him to you.
8 And when he comes, he’ll expose the world’s guilt regarding sin, righteousness, and judgment:
9 about sin, because they don’t believe in me;
10 about righteousness, because I’m going to the Father and you won’t see me anymore;
11 and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.


12 I still have many things to say to you, but you can’t handle them now.
13 When he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he’ll guide you into all truth. He won’t speak on his own; he’ll speak what he hears and will tell you what’s yet to come.
14 He’ll glorify me because he’ll take what’s mine and make it known to you.
15 Everything the Father has is mine; that’s why I said he’ll take what’s mine and make it known to you.


16 In a little while, you won’t see me anymore, and then after a little while, you’ll see me again.
17 So some of his disciples said to each other, ‘What does he mean by telling us, “In a little while, you won’t see me, and then after a little while, you’ll see me,” and “Because I’m going to the Father”?’
18 They kept saying, ‘What’s this “little while” he’s talking about? We don’t get what he’s saying.’


19 Jesus knew they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, ‘Are you discussing among yourselves what I meant when I said, “In a little while, you won’t see me, and then after a little while, you’ll see me”?
20 I’m telling you the truth: you’ll weep and mourn while the world celebrates. You’ll grieve, but your grief will turn into joy.
21 When a woman’s giving birth, she’s in pain because her time has come; but once the baby’s born, she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child’s come into the world.
22 So it is with you: right now you’re grieving, but I’ll see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.


23 On that day, you won’t ask me anything. I’m telling you the truth: whatever you ask the Father in my name, he’ll give you.
24 Up till now, you haven’t asked for anything in my name. Ask, and you’ll receive, so your joy can be complete.


25 I’ve been speaking to you in figures of speech; a time’s coming when I won’t use figures of speech anymore but will tell you plainly about the Father.
26 In that day, you’ll ask in my name, and I’m not saying I’ll ask the Father on your behalf;
27 for the Father himself loves you because you’ve loved me and believed that I came from God.
28 I came from the Father and entered the world; now I’m leaving the world and going back to the Father.”


29 His disciples said, “Look, now you’re speaking plainly and not using figures of speech!
30 Now we’re sure you know everything and don’t need anyone to question you. This makes us believe you came from God.”
31 Jesus answered them, “Do you believe now?
32 Look, a time’s coming—and it’s here—when you’ll scatter, each to your own place, and leave me alone. But I’m not alone, because the Father’s with me.
33 I’ve told you these things so you can have peace in me. In the world, you’ll face trouble. But take heart—I’ve overcome the world.”




Chapter 17


1 Jesus said these things, and lifting his eyes to heaven, he said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you,
2 just as you gave him authority over all flesh, so that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.
3 And this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
4 I glorified you on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.
5 And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world existed.


6 I have revealed your name to the people you gave me out of the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.
7 Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you,
8 because I have given them the words you gave me, and they accepted them. They truly understood that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.
9 I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, because they are yours.
10 All that is mine is yours, and all that is yours is mine, and I have been glorified in them.


11 I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name—the name you gave me—so that they may be one, just as we are one.
12 While I was with them, I protected them by the power of your name that you gave me. I guarded them, and not one of them was lost, except the son of destruction, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
13 But now I am coming to you, and I am saying these things in the world so that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.


14 I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.
15 I am not asking you to take them out of the world, but to protect them from the evil one.
16 They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.
17 Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.
18 Just as you sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.
19 And for their sake, I sanctify myself, so that they too may be sanctified in truth.


20 I am not praying only for these, but also for those who will believe in me through their word,
21 that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me and I am in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you sent me.
22 I have given them the glory you gave me, so that they may be one, just as we are one—
23 I in them and you in me—that they may be brought to complete unity, so that the world may know that you sent me and that you loved them just as you loved me.


24 Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, so that they may see my glory, which you gave me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.
25 Righteous Father, the world does not know you, but I know you, and these know that you sent me.
26 I made your name known to them, and I will continue to make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.”




Chapter 18


1 After saying these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.
2 Now Judas, the one betraying him, also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.
3 So Judas, taking the detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
4 Jesus, knowing everything that was coming upon him, went out and said to them, “Who are you looking for?”
5 They answered him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He said to them, “I am he.” Judas, the one betraying him, was also standing with them.
6 When he said to them, “I am he,” they stepped back and fell to the ground.
7 So he asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.”
8 Jesus replied, “I told you that I am he. If you’re looking for me, let these men go.”
9 This happened so that the word he had spoken might be fulfilled: “Of those you gave me, I have not lost a single one.”


10 Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
11 Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword back into its sheath. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?”


12 Then the detachment of soldiers, their commander, and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.
13 They led him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.
14 It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was better for one man to die for the people.


15 Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest and entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.
16 But Peter stood outside at the gate. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the servant girl watching the gate, and brought Peter in.
17 The servant girl at the gate said to Peter, “You’re not one of this man’s disciples too, are you?” He said, “I am not.”
18 Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing there warming themselves. Peter was also standing with them, warming himself.


19 Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
20 Jesus answered him, “I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and I said nothing in secret.
21 Why are you questioning me? Ask those who heard what I said to them. Look, they know what I said.”
22 When he said this, one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus, saying, “Is that how you answer the high priest?”
23 Jesus replied to him, “If I spoke wrongly, testify about the wrong. But if I spoke correctly, then why do you strike me?”
24 Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.


25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, “You’re not one of his disciples too, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”
26 One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Didn’t I see you with him in the garden?”
27 Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.


28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s headquarters. It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the headquarters, so that they would not be defiled but could eat the Passover.
29 So Pilate went out to them and said, “What charge are you bringing against this man?”
30 They answered him, “If this man weren’t doing something wrong, we wouldn’t have handed him over to you.”
31 Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.” The Jews said to him, “It’s not lawful for us to put anyone to death.”
32 This happened so that the word Jesus had spoken might be fulfilled, indicating what kind of death he was going to die.


33 Pilate then entered the headquarters again, called Jesus, and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
34 Jesus answered, “Are you saying this on your own, or did others tell you about me?”
35 Pilate replied, “Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?”
36 Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.”
37 Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born, and for this I came into the world—to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”
38 Pilate said to him, “What is truth?” After saying this, he went out again to the Jews and told them, “I find no guilt in him.
39 But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at the Passover. Do you want me to release the King of the Jews to you?”
40 They shouted back, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.




Chapter 19


1 Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.
2 And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple robe.
3 They repeatedly approached him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and struck him on the face.
4 Pilate went out again and said to them, “Look, I am bringing him out to you so that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”
5 So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Behold the man!” 


6 When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.”
7 The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God.”
8 When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid.
9 He entered the governor’s headquarters again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.
10 So Pilate said to him, “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?”
11 Jesus answered him, “You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given to you from above. Therefore, the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.”


12 From that moment, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.”
13 So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, or in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
14 Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, “Behold your King!”
15 They shouted, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.”
16 So then he handed him over to them to be crucified.


17 So they took Jesus, and he went out, carrying his own cross, to the place called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.
18 There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus in the middle.
19 Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”
20 Many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.
21 So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am King of the Jews.’”
22 Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”


23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier, and also his tunic. Now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.
24 So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be.” This was to fulfill the Scripture that says, “They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.” So the soldiers did these things.


25 Now standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold your son!”
27 Then he said to the disciple, “Behold your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.


28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, “I am thirsty.”
29 A jar full of sour wine was sitting there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth.
30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, “It is finished,” and he bowed his head and gave up his breath.


31 Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.
32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who had been crucified with him.
33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
34 Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once blood and water came out.
35 And the one who saw this has testified, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.
36 For these things happened so that the Scripture might be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken.”
37 And again another Scripture says, “They will look on him whom they have pierced.”


38 After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body.
39 Nicodemus, who had first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight.
40 So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.
42 So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.




Chapter 20


1 Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
2 So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him."
3 Then Peter and the other disciple went out and were going to the tomb.
4 The two were running together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first.
5 And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.
6 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb, and he saw the linen cloths lying there,
7 and the face cloth, which had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself.
8 Then the other disciple, who had come to the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed.
9 For they did not yet understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
10 Then the disciples went back to their homes.


11 But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping. Then, as she was weeping, she stooped to look into the tomb,
12 and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
13 And they said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him."
14 Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.
15 Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?" Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away."
16 Jesus said to her, "Mary." Turning, she said to him in Hebrew, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher).
17 Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
18 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples, announcing "I have seen the Lord," and that he had said these things to her.


19 Then, when it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, the doors where the disciples were staying had been locked for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."
20 And having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
21 Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you."
22 And having said this, he breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
23 If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained."


24 Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.
25 So the other disciples were saying to him, "We have seen the Lord." But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe."
26 And after eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you."
27 Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe."
28 Thomas answered and said to him, "My Lord and my God!"
29 Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."


30 Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;
31 but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.




Chapter 21


1 After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way:
2 Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.
3 Simon Peter said to them, "I’m going fishing." They said to him, "We’re coming with you, too." They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.


4 When morning had already come, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples didn’t know that it was Jesus.
5 So Jesus said to them, "Children, you don’t have any fish, do you?" They answered him, "No."
6 He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you’ll find some." So they cast it, and then they weren’t able to haul it in because of the large number of fish.


7 Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It’s the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he was stripped down) and jumped into the sea.
8 But the other disciples came in the little boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards away.


9 When they got out onto the land, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish lying on it and bread.
10 Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you just caught."
11 Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of large fish—one hundred fifty-three of them. And even though there were so many, the net wasn’t torn.


12 Jesus said to them, "Come, have breakfast." None of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" because they knew it was the Lord.
13 Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.
14 This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.


15 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs."
16 He said to him again a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Tend my sheep."
17 He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" And he said to him, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.


18 Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you dressed yourself and walked wherever you wanted; but when you grow old, you’ll stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and bring you to where you don’t want to go."
19 He said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God. And after saying this, he said to him, "Follow me."


20 Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them—the one who also had leaned back against him at the supper and said, "Lord, who is the one betraying you?"
21 When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, "Lord, what about him?"
22 Jesus said to him, "If I want him to remain until I come, what’s that to you? You follow me!"
23 So the rumor spread among the brethren that this disciple wouldn’t die. But Jesus didn’t say to him that he wouldn’t die, only, "If I want him to remain until I come, what’s that to you?"


24 This is the disciple who testifies about these things and who wrote them down, and we know that his testimony is true.
25 There are also many other things that Jesus did, which, if every one of them were written down, I suppose the world itself couldn’t contain the books that would be written.﻿The Acts of the Apostles


Chapter 1


1 In my first book, Theophilus, I wrote about everything Jesus began to do and teach  
2 until the day He was taken up, after He had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles He had chosen.  
3 After His suffering, He presented Himself alive to them with many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.  
4 While He was with them, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for the Father’s promise. “This,” He said, “is what you heard from Me—  
5 for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”  


6 So when they had come together, they asked Him, “Lord, are You restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?”
7 He said to them, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has set by His own authority.
8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
9 After He had said this, as they were watching, He was lifted up, and a cloud took Him out of their sight.
10 While they were staring into the sky as He was going, suddenly two men in white clothes stood beside them.
11 They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way that you saw Him go into heaven.”


12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near the city—a Sabbath day’s journey away.
13 When they arrived, they went up to the upstairs room where they were staying: Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
14 They were all continually united in prayer, along with the women, Mary the mother of Jesus, and His brothers.


15 During those days Peter stood up among the brothers (there were about 120 gathered together) and said,
16 “Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled that the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand through the mouth of David about Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
17 For he was numbered among us and was allotted a share in this ministry.”
18 (Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headfirst, his body burst open, and all his intestines spilled out.
19 This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that in their own language that field was called Akeldama, that is, ‘Field of Blood.’)
20 “For it is written in the Book of Psalms: ‘Let his dwelling become desolate; let no one live in it,’ and, ‘Let someone else take his position.’


21 Therefore, from among the men who have accompanied us during the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us—
22 beginning from the baptism of John until the day He was taken up from us—one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.”
23 So they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also known as Justus) and Matthias.
24 Then they prayed, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen
25 to take the place in this ministry and apostleship, which Judas left to go to his own place.”
26 Then they cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias, so he was added to the eleven apostles.




Chapter 2


1 When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place.
2 Suddenly, a sound like a violent rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
3 Divided tongues, like fire, appeared and rested on each one of them.
4 They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages as the Spirit gave them the ability.  


5 Now there were Jews staying in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.
6 When this sound occurred, a crowd came together and was confused because each one heard them speaking in his own language.
7 They were astounded and said, “Look, aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans?
8 How is it that each of us hears them in our own native language?
9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites—those who live in Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome,
11 both Jews and converts; Cretans and Arabians—we hear them declaring the mighty works of God in our own tongues!”
12 They were all amazed and puzzled, saying to one another, “What does this mean?”
13 But others mocked and said, “They’re full of new wine.”  


14 Then Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them: “Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and listen to my words.
15 These men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it’s only the third hour of the day.
16 On the contrary, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:


17 ‘And it will be in the last days, says the Lord,  
that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.  
Your sons and your daughters will prophesy,  
your young men will see visions,  
and your old men will dream dreams.
18 Even on my male servants and my female servants,  
in those days I will pour out my Spirit,  
and they will prophesy.
19 I will display wonders in the heavens above  
and signs on the earth below,  
blood and fire and a cloud of smoke.
20 The sun will be turned to darkness  
and the moon to blood  
before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.  
21 Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’  


22 “Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus of Nazareth was a man attested to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs that God did among you through him, just as you yourselves know.
23 This man was handed over by God’s determined plan and foreknowledge, and you used lawless men to nail him to a cross and kill him.
24 But God raised him up, ending the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.
25 For David says about him:  


‘I saw the Lord always before me;  
because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.  
26 Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced.  
Moreover, my flesh will rest in hope,  
27 because you will not abandon my body to the grave
or allow your Holy One to see decay.  
28 You have made known to me the paths of life;  
you will fill me with joy in your presence.’  


29 “Brothers, I can confidently speak to you about the patriarch David: he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
30 Since he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn an oath to him that one of his descendants would sit on his throne,
31 he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ: He was not abandoned to the grave, and his flesh did not see decay.  


32 “God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it.
33 Therefore, since he has been exalted to the right hand of God and has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, he has poured out what you both see and hear.
34 For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says:  


‘The Lord said to my Lord,  
“Sit at my right hand  
35 until I make your enemies  
a footstool for your feet.”’  


36 “Therefore, let all the house of Israel know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.”  


37 When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?”  


38 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
39 For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call.”
40 With many other words he testified and urged them, saying, “Be saved from this corrupt generation!”
41 So those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand people were added to the believers.


42 They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.


43 A sense of awe came over everyone, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles.
44 All the believers were together and held all things in common.
45 They sold their possessions and property and distributed the proceeds to all, as anyone had need.
46 Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the temple and broke bread from house to house. They ate their food with glad and sincere hearts,
47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.




Chapter 3


1 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
2 And a man who had been lame from birth was being carried there, whom they would lay daily at the temple gate called Beautiful, so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple.
3 When he saw Peter and John about to enter the temple, he began asking to receive alms.
4 But Peter, looking intently at him along with John, said, “Look at us.”
5 So he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.
6 But Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have, I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk.”
7 And taking hold of him by the right hand, he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were strengthened.
8 Leaping up, he stood and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.
9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God,
10 and they recognized that he was the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to ask for alms, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.  


11 While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at Solomon’s portico, utterly astonished.
12 When Peter saw this, he responded to the people, “Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this, or why are you staring at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?
13 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected before Pilate, even when he had decided to release Him.
14 But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked instead for a murderer to be granted to you.
15 You killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead—of which we are witnesses.
16 But because this man, this one whom you see and know, believed in Jesus' name, he has been healed in His name. The faith that is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.


17 And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did.
18 But what God foretold through the mouth of all the prophets—that His Christ would suffer—He has thus fulfilled.
19 Therefore, repent and turn back, so that your sins may be wiped away,
20 so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that He may send the Christ appointed for you—Jesus—
21 whom heaven must receive until the time of the restoration of all things, which God spoke about through the mouth of His holy prophets long ago.
22 Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to everything He tells you.
23 And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be completely cut off from the people.’
24 And indeed, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those after him, also proclaimed these days.  


25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.’
26 God, having raised up His servant, sent Him first to you, to bless you by turning each of you from your wickedness.”




Chapter 4


1 Now as they were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees came up to them,
2 greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
3 They seized them and put them in custody until the next day, since it was already evening.
4 But many of those who heard the message believed, and the number of the men grew to about five thousand.  


5 The next day, their rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem,
6 along with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family.
7 After placing them in the midst, they began to inquire, “By what power or in what name have you done this?”  


8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders,
9 if we are being examined today about a good deed done to a crippled man—by what means he was healed—
10 let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands before you healthy.
11 This Jesus is ‘the stone rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.’
12 And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.”  


13 When they saw the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were astonished and recognized that they had been with Jesus.
14 And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in opposition.
15 So they ordered them to leave the Sanhedrin and conferred among themselves,
16 saying, “What should we do with these men? For it is clear to all who live in Jerusalem that an amazing miracle has been done through them, and we cannot deny it.
17 But to keep it from spreading any further among the people, let us warn them not to speak to anyone in this name again.”  


18 So they summoned them and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
19 But Peter and John answered them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge.
20 For we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.”  


21 After threatening them further, they released them, since they found no way to punish them because of the people, for everyone was glorifying God over what had happened.
22 For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.  


23 After they were released, they went to their own people and reported everything the chief priests and elders had said to them.
24 When they heard this, they raised their voices together to God and said, “Sovereign Lord, You made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
25 You spoke through the Holy Spirit by the mouth of our father David, Your servant:  


‘Why did the nations rage  
and the peoples plot futile things?  
26 The kings of the earth took their stand,  
and the rulers assembled together  
against the Lord and against His Christ.’  


27 For truly in this city both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed,
28 to do whatever Your hand and will had predestined to take place.
29 And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant that Your servants may speak Your word with all boldness,
30 while You stretch out Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of Your holy servant Jesus.”  


31 When they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.  


32 Now the multitude of believers was of one heart and soul, and no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they had everything in common.
33 With great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
34 For there was not a needy person among them, because all who owned lands or houses sold them,
35 brought the proceeds of what was sold, and laid them at the apostles’ feet, and they were distributed to each as anyone had need.  


36 Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means “Son of Encouragement”),
37 sold a field he owned, brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.




Chapter 5


1 But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,
2 and with his wife’s knowledge, he kept back part of the proceeds for himself and brought only a portion of it, laying it at the apostles’ feet.
3 But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the money from the land’s sale?
4 While it remained unsold, wasn’t it yours? And after it was sold, wasn’t the money still under your control? Why have you set this thing in your heart? You haven’t lied to men but to God.”
5 When Ananias heard these words, he collapsed and died. And great fear came upon all who heard about it.
6 The young men got up, wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him.  


7 About three hours later, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
8 Peter asked her, “Tell me, did you sell the land for this amount?” She said, “Yes, for that amount.”
9 Then Peter said to her, “Why did you both agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out as well.”
10 Instantly, she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in, they found her dead, so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
11 And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard about these things.  


12 Many signs and wonders were being done among the people through the hands of the apostles. They were all together in Solomon’s Colonnade.
13 No one else dared to join them, but the people held them in high regard.
14 More and more believers were added to the Lord—multitudes of men and women.
15 As a result, they would carry the sick out into the streets and lay them on cots and mats so that when Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them.
16 Crowds also came from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.  


17 But the high priest rose up, along with all who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy.
18 They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.
19 But during the night, an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors, brought them out, and said,
20 “Go, stand in the temple courts and tell the people all about this life.”
21 When they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach.  


When the high priest and those with him arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin, and the full assembly of the elders of Israel, and sent for the apostles in jail.
22 But when the officers arrived, they did not find them in the prison. So they went back and reported,
23 “We found the jail locked securely and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”
24 When the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard this, they were perplexed, wondering what this could mean.
25 Then someone came and reported, “Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple and teaching the people.”  


26 Then the captain went with the officers and brought them back, but without force, because they were afraid the people might stone them.
27 After bringing them in, they made them stand before the Sanhedrin, and the high priest questioned them:
28 “Didn’t we strictly command you not to teach in this name? But instead, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to bring this man’s blood upon us.”
29 But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men.
30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.
31 God exalted him to his right hand as Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and the forgiveness of sins.
32 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”  


33 When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them.
34 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law respected by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered the men to be taken outside for a little while.
35 Then he said to them, “Men of Israel, be careful what you are about to do to these men.
36 Some time ago, Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.
37 After him, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and led people in a revolt. He also perished, and all who followed him were scattered.
38 So in the present case, I tell you, stay away from these men and leave them alone. For if this plan or work is of human origin, it will fail.
39 But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop them. You might even be found fighting against God.”  


40 They were persuaded by him. So they called in the apostles, had them flogged, ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them.
41 When they left the presence of the Sanhedrin, they were rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name.
42 Every day, in the temple and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.




Chapter 6


1 Now in those days, as the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint arose from the Greek-speakers against the Hebrew-speakers because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.


2 So the Twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not right for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables.
3 Therefore, brothers, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and wisdom, whom we will appoint for this duty.
4 But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”


5 This proposal pleased the whole group, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a convert from Antioch.
6 They presented them before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.


7 So the word of God continued to spread, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem increased greatly, and a large group of priests became obedient to the faith.


8 Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.
9 But some men from the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and argued with Stephen.
10 Yet they could not stand against the wisdom and the Spirit by whom he spoke.


11 Then they secretly instigated men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”
12 They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and they rushed upon him, seized him, and brought him before the Sanhedrin.
13 They set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the law.
14 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”


15 And all who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at him and saw that his face was like the face of an angel.  




Chapter 7


1 The high priest said, "Are these things so?"


2 Stephen replied, "Brothers and fathers, listen! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
3 and said to him, 'Leave your country and your relatives and go to the land that I will show you.'
4 Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, God moved him from there to this land where you now live.
5 Yet He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, but He promised to give it to him as a possession, and to his descendants after him, even though he had no child.
6 God said to him that his descendants would live as strangers in a foreign land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.
7 'But I will judge the nation that they serve as slaves,' God said, 'and afterwards they will come out and worship Me in this place.'
8 Then He gave him the covenant of circumcision, and so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. Isaac did the same for Jacob, and Jacob for the twelve patriarchs.


9 The patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt, but God was with him
10 and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler over Egypt and over his whole household.
11 Then a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, causing great suffering, and our fathers could not find food.
12 But when Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there the first time.
13 On their second visit, Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers, and Pharaoh learned of Joseph’s family.
14 Joseph then sent for his father Jacob and all his relatives, seventy-five persons in all.
15 So Jacob went down to Egypt, and he and our fathers died there.
16 Their bodies were carried back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.


17 As the time drew near for God to fulfill the promise He had made to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,
18 until another king arose who knew nothing of Joseph.
19 This king dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our fathers, forcing them to abandon their infants so they would not survive.
20 At that time, Moses was born, and he was beautiful in God’s sight. He was nurtured in his father’s house for three months.
21 When he was abandoned, Pharaoh’s daughter took him in and raised him as her own son.
22 So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds.


23 When he was forty years old, he decided to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel.
24 Seeing one of them being mistreated, he defended him and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian.
25 He thought his brothers would understand that God was giving them deliverance through him, but they did not understand.
26 The next day he came upon two Israelites fighting and tried to reconcile them. ‘Men,’ he said, ‘you are brothers. Why are you mistreating each other?’
27 But the one mistreating his neighbor pushed him aside and said, ‘Who appointed you ruler and judge over us?
28 Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’
29 When Moses heard this, he fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he fathered two sons.


30 After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning bush.
31 When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight. As he approached to look more closely, the voice of the Lord came:
32 ‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses trembled and did not dare to look.
33 Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
34 I have surely seen the oppression of My people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to rescue them. Now come, I am sending you to Egypt.’


35 This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, ‘Who appointed you ruler and judge?’—this man God sent as both ruler and deliverer through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
36 He led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.
37 This is the Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers.’
38 He was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living words to give to us.
39 But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.
40 They said to Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go before us! As for this Moses who brought us out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.’
41 They made a calf in those days, offered sacrifices to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
42 But God turned away and handed them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets:


‘Did you bring Me sacrifices and offerings
for forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
43 You took up the tent of Moloch
and the star of your god Rephan,
the images you made to worship.
So I will exile you beyond Babylon.’


44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, just as God commanded Moses to make it according to the pattern he had seen.
45 Our fathers received it and brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before them. It remained until the time of David,
46 who found favor with God and asked to provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
47 But it was Solomon who built Him a house.
48 However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands, as the prophet says:


49 ‘Heaven is My throne,
and the earth is My footstool.
What kind of house will you build for Me?
says the Lord,
or where will My resting place be?
50 Did not My hand make all these things?’


51 You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit—just as your fathers did, so do you.
52 Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered—
53 you who received the Law ordained by angels and yet have not kept it."


54 When they heard these things, they were enraged and gnashed their teeth at him.
55 But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
56 He said, "Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!"


57 But they cried out with a loud voice, covered their ears, and rushed at him together.
58 They threw him out of the city and stoned him. The witnesses laid their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
59 As they were stoning Stephen, he called out, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!"
60 Then he fell to his knees and cried out in a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them!" When he had said this, he fell asleep.




Chapter 8


1 Saul fully approved of Stephen’s execution. That day, a severe persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
2 Devout men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.
3 But Saul was ravaging the church, going from house to house, dragging off men and women, and putting them in prison.


4 Those who were scattered went about preaching the word.
5 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them.
6 The crowds listened attentively to what Philip said, because they heard and saw the signs he performed.
7 For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying out with a loud voice, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.
8 So there was great joy in that city.


9 Now a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.
10 Everyone, from the least to the greatest, paid attention to him and said, “This man is the power of God that is called Great.”
11 They listened to him because he had amazed them with his sorceries for a long time.
12 But when they believed Philip, who was preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
13 Even Simon himself believed, and after he was baptized, he followed Philip closely and was amazed as he observed the signs and great miracles taking place.


14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
15 When they arrived, they prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit,
16 because He had not yet fallen on any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
17 Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.


18 When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money
19 and said, “Give me this authority too, so that everyone I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.”


20 But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
21 You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right before God.
22 Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven.
23 For I see that you are full of bitter poison and bound by iniquity.”
24 Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.”


25 After they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.


26 Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Get up and go south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert road.)
27 So he got up and went. There he saw an Ethiopian eunuch, a high official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship
28 and was sitting in his chariot on his way home, reading the prophet Isaiah.
29 The Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join that chariot.”
30 So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet. He asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”
31 The eunuch said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.


32 Now the passage of Scripture he was reading was this:  
“He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,  
and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,  
so He does not open His mouth.
33 In His humiliation, justice was denied Him.  
Who can describe His generation?  
For His life is taken from the earth.”  


34 The eunuch said to Philip, “I ask you, who is the prophet talking about—himself or someone else?”
35 Then Philip opened his mouth and, beginning with this Scripture, preached Jesus to him.
36 As they traveled along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is stopping me from being baptized?”
37 []
38 So he ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.
39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
40 Philip, however, found himself at Azotus, and as he traveled, he preached the gospel in all the towns until he came to Caesarea.




Chapter 9


1 Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them under arrest to Jerusalem.


3 As he traveled, he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
4 Falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"
5 He said, "Who are You, Lord?" And He said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
6 But get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do."


7 The men traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
8 Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
9 For three days he was without sight, and he neither ate nor drank.


10 Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." And he said, "Here I am, Lord."
11 The Lord said to him, "Get up and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, and right now, he is praying,
12 and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay hands on him so that he might regain his sight."
13 But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.
14 And here he has authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on Your name."


15 But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of Mine to carry My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel.
16 For I will show him how much he must suffer for My name’s sake."


17 So Ananias departed and entered the house. After laying his hands on him, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."


18 Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. He got up and was baptized,
19 and after taking food, he regained his strength. Now for several days he was with the disciples in Damascus,
20 and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is the Son of God."


21 All those who heard him were amazed and said, "Is this not the man who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name and had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?"
22 But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ.


23 When many days had passed, the Jews plotted together to kill him,
24 but their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the gates day and night so that they might kill him,
25 but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.


26 When he arrived in Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and he described to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.
28 So he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
29 He was talking and arguing with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they were trying to kill him.
30 When the brothers learned of this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.


31 So the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and was being built up. Walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.


32 Now as Peter was traveling throughout all those regions, he also came down to the saints who lived in Lydda.
33 There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years because he was paralyzed.
34 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed." Immediately he got up.
35 All who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.


36 Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha, which translated is Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity.
37 In those days she became sick and died, and after washing her, they laid her in an upstairs room.
38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, "Do not delay in coming to us."
39 So Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they brought him to the upstairs room, and all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing the tunics and garments that Dorcas had made while she was with them.


40 But Peter sent them all outside, knelt down, and prayed. Then turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, arise." She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
41 He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then he called the saints and widows and presented her alive.
42 This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.


43 And Peter stayed in Joppa for many days with a tanner named Simon.




Chapter 10


1 Now there was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Cohort,
2 a devout man who feared God with all his household. He gave many alms to the people and prayed to God continually.  


3 About the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, “Cornelius!”
4 Staring at him in fear, he said, “What is it, Lord?” And the angel said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have gone up as a memorial before God.
5 Now send men to Joppa and summon Simon, who is also called Peter.
6 He is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the sea.”
7 When the angel who spoke to him had left, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from those who attended him,
8 and after explaining everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.


9 The next day, as they were traveling and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour.
10 He became hungry and wanted to eat, but while they were preparing food, he fell into a trance.
11 He saw heaven opened and something like a great sheet being let down by its four corners to the earth.
12 In it were all kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles of the earth, and birds of the sky.
13 Then a voice came to him, “Rise, Peter; kill and eat.”
14 But Peter said, “By no means, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.”
15 Again, a voice came to him a second time: “What God has made clean, do not call common.”
16 This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken up into heaven.


17 While Peter was deeply perplexed about what the vision he had seen might mean, the men sent by Cornelius arrived at the gate, having asked for Simon’s house.
18 They called out and asked whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there.
19 While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you.
20 Get up, go downstairs, and go with them without hesitation, for I have sent them.”
21 So Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason you have come?”
22 They said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you and to hear what you have to say.”
23 So he invited them in and gave them lodging.  


The next day, he got up and went with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went with him.
24 The following day, he entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
25 When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him.
26 But Peter lifted him up, saying, “Stand up; I am also a man.”
27 As he talked with him, he went in and found many people gathered.
28 He said to them, “You know that it is unlawful for a Jewish man to associate with or visit a foreigner, but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
29 That is why I came without objection when I was sent for. So I ask: For what reason have you sent for me?”


30 Cornelius said, “Four days ago, at this very hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour. And behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing
31 and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms have been remembered before God.
32 Send therefore to Joppa and summon Simon, who is also called Peter. He is staying in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.’
33 So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now, therefore, we are all here in the presence of God to hear everything you have been commanded by the Lord.”


34 Then Peter opened his mouth and said, “Truly, I understand that God does not show partiality,
35 but in every nation, the man who fears Him and does what is right is acceptable to Him.
36 As for the message He sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming the gospel of peace through Jesus Christ—He is Lord of all—
37 you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed:
38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.
39 We are witnesses of everything He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a tree.
40 But God raised Him on the third day and allowed Him to be seen,
41 not by all the people, but by witnesses chosen beforehand by God—by us who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.
42 And He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that He is the one appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead.
43 To Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.”


44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the message.
45 The believers from the circumcision who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.
46 For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter responded,
47 “Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?”
48 So he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for a few days.  




Chapter 11


1 Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
2 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the converts from Judaism took issue with him,
3 saying, “You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them!”  


4 But Peter began to explain to them in an orderly manner, saying,
5 “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance, I saw a vision—an object like a large sheet was coming down, being lowered from heaven by its four corners, and it came to me.
6 Looking closely at it, I considered it and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the sky.
7 Then I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat!’
8 But I said, ‘By no means, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’
9 But the voice from heaven answered a second time, ‘What God has made clean, you must not call common.’
10 This happened three times, and then everything was pulled up again into heaven.  


11 And behold, at that very moment, three men arrived at the house where we were staying, sent from Caesarea to me.
12 The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house.
13 He told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is also called Peter.
14 He will speak to you words by which you and all your household will be saved.’
15 As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came upon them just as He did upon us at the beginning.
16 Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’
17 Therefore, if God gave them the same gift as He also gave to us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to stand in God’s way?”  


18 When they heard this, they became silent, and they glorified God, saying, “Then God has also granted the Gentiles repentance leading to life!”  


19 Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.
20 But there were some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks as well, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus.
21 And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.
22 News about them reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
23 When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with steadfast hearts.
24 For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great many people were added to the Lord.  


25 Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
26 and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. For an entire year, they met with the church and taught a great many people. And it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.  


27 Now in those days, some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
28 One of them, named Agabus, stood up and predicted by the Spirit that a great famine was going to come over the whole world, which happened during the reign of Claudius.
29 So the disciples decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea, each according to his ability.
30 And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.




Chapter 12


1 About that time, King Herod laid hands on some from the church to mistreat them.
2 He put James, the brother of John, to death with the sword.
3 When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter as well—this happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
4 After seizing him, he put him in prison, handing him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.
5 So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.  


6 On the very night before Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, while guards stood watch at the door of the prison.
7 Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell. Touching Peter on the side, he woke him up, saying, “Get up quickly!” And the chains fell off his hands.
8 Then the angel said to him, “Get dressed and put on your sandals.” And he did so. Then he said to him, “Wrap your cloak around yourself and follow me.”
9 Peter went out and followed him, but he did not realize that what was happening through the angel was real—he thought he was seeing a vision.
10 After passing the first and second guard posts, they came to the iron gate leading into the city, which opened for them by itself. They went outside and walked down one street, and immediately the angel left him.  


11 When Peter came to himself, he said, “Now I truly know that the Lord has sent His angel and rescued me from Herod’s hand and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.”
12 When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John (who was also called Mark), where many had gathered and were praying.
13 When he knocked at the door of the outer gate, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.
14 When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed that she did not open the gate but ran inside and announced that Peter was standing at the gate.
15 They said to her, “You’re out of your mind.” But she kept insisting that it was true, and they said, “It’s his angel.”
16 Meanwhile, Peter kept knocking. When they opened the door and saw him, they were amazed.
17 Motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. Then he said, “Tell these things to James and the brothers.” And he departed and went to another place.  


18 At daybreak, there was a great commotion among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.
19 After Herod searched for him and did not find him, he interrogated the guards and ordered them to be executed. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.  


20 Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They came to him as a group, and after winning over Blastus, who was in charge of the king’s bedroom, they asked for peace because their region depended on the king’s land for food.
21 On an appointed day, Herod, dressed in royal robes, sat on the throne and delivered a speech to them.
22 The people began to shout, “The voice of a god, and not of a man!”
23 Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not give glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and died.  


24 But the word of God continued to grow and spread.
25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem after fulfilling their ministry, bringing with them John, who was also called Mark.




Chapter 13


1 Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, a close friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
3 Then after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them and sent them off.


4 So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
5 When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they also had John as their assistant.
6 As they traveled through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came across a magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus.
7 He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, seeking to hear the word of God.
8 But Elymas the magician (for that is what his name means) opposed them, trying to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
9 But Saul, also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, stared at him
10 and said, "You son of the devil, full of all deceit and all fraud, enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?
11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is against you, and you will be blind, unable to see the sun for a time." Immediately a mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
12 Then the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.


13 Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
14 They continued from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath day, they went into the synagogue and sat down.
15 After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders sent to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, speak."


16 Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and said, "Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen!
17 The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, He led them out of it.
18 For about forty years, He put up with them in the wilderness.
19 After destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, He gave them their land as an inheritance.
20 All this took about 450 years. After that, He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
21 Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
22 When He removed him, He raised up David as their king, about whom He also testified, saying, 'I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.'
23 From this man’s descendants, according to the promise, God brought Israel a Savior, Jesus.
24 Before His coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
25 And as John was finishing his course, he said, 'Who do you suppose I am? I am not He. But behold, One is coming after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'


26 "Brothers, sons of Abraham’s family, and those among you who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.
27 For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize Him or the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning Him.
28 Though they found no reason for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have Him executed.
29 When they had fulfilled all that was written about Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.
30 But God raised Him from the dead,
31 and for many days He appeared to those who had come up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His witnesses to the people.
32 And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers,
33 He has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm: 'You are My Son; today I have begotten You.'
34 And as for the fact that He raised Him from the dead, no longer to return to decay, He has spoken in this way: 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'
35 Therefore, He also says in another Psalm: 'You will not let Your Holy One see decay.'
36 For David, after serving the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and saw decay.
37 But He whom God raised up did not see decay.


38 "Therefore, let it be known to you, brothers, that through this Man, forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
39 And by Him, everyone who believes is justified from everything that you could not be justified from by the Law of Moses.
40 So beware that what is said in the prophets does not happen to you:
41 'Look, you scoffers, be amazed and perish! For I am doing a work in your days, a work you will never believe, even if someone tells you.'"


42 As they were leaving, the people begged that these things be spoken to them again on the next Sabbath.
43 After the synagogue meeting, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.


44 On the next Sabbath, almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
45 But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what Paul was saying, blaspheming.
46 Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly, saying, "It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. But since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.
47 For this is what the Lord has commanded us: 'I have made you a light to the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'"


48 When the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord, and all who were appointed to eternal life believed.
49 And the word of the Lord spread throughout the whole region.
50 But the Jews stirred up the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, incited persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.
51 But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium.
52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.




Chapter 14


1 Now in Iconium, they entered the Jewish synagogue together and spoke in such a way that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed.
2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and embittered their minds against the brothers.
3 So they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who testified to the message of His grace by granting signs and wonders to be done through their hands.
4 But the people of the city were divided: some sided with the Jews, and others with the apostles.
5 When both the Gentiles and Jews, along with their rulers, made a plan to mistreat and stone them,
6 they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the surrounding region,
7 where they continued to preach the gospel.


8 In Lystra, a man was sitting who had no strength in his feet, lame from birth, who had never walked.
9 He listened as Paul spoke. Paul looked at him intently and saw that he had faith to be healed.
10 So he said in a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet!” And he jumped up and began to walk.
11 When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!”
12 They called Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
13 The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, intending to offer sacrifices with the crowds.  


14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,
15 “Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men with the same nature as you, proclaiming to you that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven, earth, the sea, and everything in them.
16 In past generations, He allowed all the nations to go their own ways,
17 yet He did not leave Himself without witnesses, since He did good by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling you with food and gladness.”
18 Even with these words, they barely kept the crowds from offering sacrifices to them.


19 But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and after persuading the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead.
20 But when the disciples gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.


21 After they had preached the gospel in that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
22 strengthening the hearts and minds of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, “It is necessary to go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God.”
23 When they had appointed elders for them in every church and prayed with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had believed.


24 After passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
25 When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
26 From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the work they had now completed.
27 When they arrived, they gathered the church together and reported everything God had done with them and how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
28 And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.  




Chapter 15


1 Some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”
2 This led to a major dispute and debate between Paul and Barnabas and these men. So it was decided that Paul, Barnabas, and some others should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.


3 Sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles, and this brought great joy to all the brothers.
4 When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they reported everything God had done through them.
5 But some believers who had previously been Pharisees stood up and said, “It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the Law of Moses.”


6 The apostles and elders gathered to consider this matter.
7 After much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that from the early days God chose that, through my mouth, the Gentiles would hear the message of the gospel and believe.
8 And God, who knows the heart, testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit just as He did to us.
9 He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
10 So why are you now testing God by placing on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?
11 On the contrary, we believe we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the same way they are.”


12 The whole assembly fell silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul as they described the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.
13 After they finished speaking, James responded, “Brothers, listen to me.
14 Simeon has reported how God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people for His name.
15 And the words of the prophets agree with this, just as it is written:


16 ‘After this, I will return  
and rebuild David’s fallen tent.  
I will rebuild its ruins  
and restore it,


17 so that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,  
including all the Gentiles who are called by My name—  
says the Lord who makes these things
18 known from long ago.’


19 Therefore, in my judgment, we should not trouble those from the Gentiles who are turning to God,
20 but instead we should write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from what has been strangled, and from blood.
21 For since ancient times, Moses has had those who proclaim him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.”


22 Then the apostles and elders, along with the whole church, decided to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas—Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers.
23 They sent this letter with them:  


“The apostles and the elders, your brothers, to the brothers from the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings.


24 Since we have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and troubled you with their words, unsettling your souls,
25 it seemed good to us, having reached a unanimous decision, to send men to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
26 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
27 Therefore, we have sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.
28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place any greater burden on you than these necessary things:
29 that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.”


30 So they were sent off and went down to Antioch, and when they had gathered the assembly, they delivered the letter.
31 When the people read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.
32 Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words.
33 After spending some time there, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.
34 []
35 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord along with many others.


36 After some time, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s go back and visit the brothers in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord to see how they are doing.”
37 Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, with them,
38 but Paul insisted that they should not take him because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.
39 They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted ways. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus,
40 but Paul chose Silas and departed, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.
41 He traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.




Chapter 16


 1 Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a believing Jewish woman but of a Greek father,
2 who was well spoken of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.
3 Paul wanted Timothy to go with him, so he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was Greek.
4 As they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees that had been decided upon by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem, for them to keep.
5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in number daily.  


6 They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
7 When they came to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.
8 So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.
9 A vision appeared to Paul in the night: a Macedonian man was standing and urging him, saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
10 When Paul saw the vision, we immediately sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.  


11 Setting sail from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis,
12 and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a Roman colony. We remained in this city for some days.
13 On the Sabbath, we went outside the city gate by the river, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered.
14 A woman named Lydia, a seller of purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, was listening. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was spoken by Paul.
15 After she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay in my house." And she persuaded us.  


16 As we were going to the place of prayer, a slave girl met us who had a spirit of divination and brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling.
17 She followed Paul and us, crying out, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation."
18 She did this for many days. But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out at that very moment.  


19 When her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
20 They brought them to the magistrates and said, "These men are throwing our city into confusion. They are Jews
21 and are proclaiming customs that are not lawful for us, being Romans, to accept or practice."
22 The crowd rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore off their garments and ordered them to be beaten with rods.
23 After giving them many blows, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them securely.
24 Receiving this order, he put them into the inner prison and secured their feet in the stocks.  


25 About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
26 Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. Immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's chains were unfastened.
27 When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.
28 But Paul shouted with a loud voice, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!"
29 The jailer called for lights, rushed in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.
30 He brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
31 They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household."
32 They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to everyone in his house.
33 That same hour of the night, he took them and washed their wounds. Immediately he and all his household were baptized.
34 He brought them into his house, set a meal before them, and rejoiced greatly that he had believed in God with his whole household.  


35 When it was day, the magistrates sent officers, saying, "Release those men."
36 The jailer reported these words to Paul: "The magistrates have sent orders that you be released. Now therefore, come out and go in peace."
37 But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly without a trial—men who are Roman citizens—and have thrown us into prison. And now, are they sending us away secretly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out."
38 The officers reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.
39 So they came and pleaded with them, and when they had brought them out, they asked them to leave the city.
40 After leaving the prison, they went to Lydia’s house. There they saw the brothers, encouraged them, and departed.




Chapter 17


1 After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
2 As was his custom, Paul went in to them, and for three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
3 explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead. “This Jesus whom I proclaim to you,” he said, “is the Christ.”
4 Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women.


5 But the Jews became jealous, and taking some wicked men from the marketplace, they formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They attacked Jason’s house, trying to bring them out to the people.
6 But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city officials, shouting, “These men who have turned the world upside down have come here too,
7 and Jason has welcomed them. They are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king—Jesus.”
8 The crowd and the city officials were disturbed when they heard these things,
9 and after taking security from Jason and the others, they let them go.


10 The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
11 These Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.
12 Therefore, many of them believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men.
13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that Paul was proclaiming the word of God in Berea, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds.
14 Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, while Silas and Timothy remained there.
15 Those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving instructions for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.


16 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was full of idols.
17 So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also debated with him. Some said, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods,” because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.
19 So they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
20 For you are bringing some strange things to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.”
21 (Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing else but telling or hearing something new.)


22 Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that in every way you are very religious.
23 For as I was passing through and observing your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: ‘To an Unknown God.’ Therefore, what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.
24 The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by human hands,
25 nor is He served by human hands as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all life, breath, and everything else.
26 From one man, He made every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their dwelling places,
27 so that they might seek God and perhaps reach out for Him and find Him, though He is not far from any one of us.
28 For in Him we live and move and have our being, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we also are His offspring.’


29 Since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by human skill and imagination.
30 In the past, God overlooked the times of ignorance, but now He commands all men everywhere to repent,
31 because He has set a day when He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man He has appointed. He has given proof of this to all by raising Him from the dead.”


32 When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, but others said, “We will hear you again about this.”
33 So Paul left them.
34 But some men joined him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.




Chapter 18


1 After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
2 There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,
3 and since they shared the same trade, he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade.
4 Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade both Jews and Greeks.


5 When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself fully to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
6 But when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothes and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles.”
7 So he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.
8 Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord along with his entire household, and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.


9 One night, the Lord said to Paul in a vision, “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent,
10 for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, because I have many people in this city.”
11 So he stayed there for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.


12 But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up against Paul with one accord and brought him before the tribunal,
13 saying, “This man persuades people to worship God contrary to the law.”
14 As Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, “If this were some wrongdoing or serious crime, Jews, I would tolerate listening to you.
15 But since it is a dispute about words, names, and your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these matters.”
16 And he drove them from the tribunal.
17 Then they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal, but Gallio showed no concern over any of this.


18 Paul stayed many days longer, then took leave of the brothers and set sail for Syria, taking Priscilla and Aquila with him. In Cenchreae, he had his head shaved because of a vow he had taken.
19 When they arrived in Ephesus, he left them there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
20 When they asked him to stay longer, he declined,
21 but as he left, he said, “I will return to you if God wills,” and he set sail from Ephesus.


22 When he landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, then went down to Antioch.
23 After spending some time there, he departed and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.


24 Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well-versed in the Scriptures.
25 He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and, being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately about Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.
26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God to him more accurately.


27 When he wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,
28 for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.




Chapter 19


1 While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the inland regions and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples
2 and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”


They answered, “We haven’t even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”


3 So he asked, “Into what, then, were you baptized?”


They replied, “Into John’s baptism.”


4 Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was coming after him—that is, in Jesus.”
5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
6 And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying.
7 There were about twelve men in all.


8 Paul went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.
9 But when some became hardened and refused to believe, speaking evil of the Way before the crowd, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
10 This continued for two years, so that all who lived in Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.


11 God was performing extraordinary miracles through Paul,
12 so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick, and their diseases left them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
13 Now some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I command you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches!”
14 Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.


15 But the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?”
16 Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them, overpowered them all, and prevailed against them, so that they ran out of the house naked and wounded.
17 This became known to everyone who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
18 Many who had become believers came confessing and disclosing their practices,
19 and a number of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in front of everyone. They calculated the value and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
20 In this way, the word of the Lord grew and prevailed powerfully.


21 After these events, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go through Macedonia and Achaia, then to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.”
22 So he sent two of those who assisted him, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in Asia for a while.


23 At that time, a major disturbance arose concerning the Way.
24 A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in a great deal of business for the craftsmen.
25 He gathered them together, along with others in similar trades, and said, “Men, you know that our prosperity comes from this trade.
26 And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but almost all over Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a large number of people, saying that gods made by human hands are not gods at all.
27 Not only is there danger that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and that she, whom all of Asia and the world worship, will be robbed of her majesty.”


28 When they heard this, they were filled with rage and began shouting, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
29 The city was thrown into chaos, and they rushed all together into the theater, dragging Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul’s traveling companions.
30 Though Paul wanted to go in before the crowd, the disciples would not let him.
31 Even some of the officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent word to him, pleading with him not to venture into the theater.


32 Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them didn’t even know why they had gathered.
33 Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had pushed forward. Alexander motioned with his hand and wanted to make a defense to the people.
34 But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”


35 When the city clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who in all the world doesn’t know that the city of the Ephesians is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image that fell from heaven?
36 Since these things are undeniable, you must stay calm and do nothing reckless.
37 For you have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess.
38 So if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls—let them bring charges against one another.
39 But if you seek anything beyond this, it must be decided in a lawful assembly.
40 As it stands, we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no justification for this uproar.”
41 After saying this, he dismissed the assembly.




Chapter 20


1 After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, encouraged them, said farewell, and departed for Macedonia.
2 When he had traveled through those regions and given them much encouragement, he came to Greece.
3 He stayed there for three months, but when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.
4 He was accompanied by Sopater, the son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia.
5 These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.
6 But we sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we joined them at Troas, where we stayed for seven days.


7 On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul spoke to them, intending to leave the next day, and he extended his message until midnight.
8 There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered.
9 A young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window, and as Paul kept speaking for a long time, he was overcome by deep sleep. When he fell asleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.
10 But Paul went down, bent over him, took him in his arms, and said, “Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.”
11 When Paul had gone back up, broken bread, and eaten, he talked with them a long while, until dawn, and then departed.
12 They took the young man away alive and were greatly comforted.  


13 We went on ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there, for he had arranged it this way, since he intended to travel by land.
14 When he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.
15 We sailed from there, and the next day we arrived off Chios. The day after that, we reached Samos, and the following day we came to Miletus.
16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in Asia, because he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.


17 From Miletus, he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the church.
18 When they came to him, he said to them, “You yourselves know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I set foot in Asia,
19 serving the Lord with all humility and with tears, enduring trials that came upon me through the plots of the Jews.
20 I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was beneficial, and I taught you publicly and from house to house,
21 testifying both to Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.


22 And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,
23 except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that chains and afflictions await me.
24 But I do not consider my life of any value to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus—to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.


25 And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will see my face again.
26 Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men,
27 for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.
28 Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which He purchased with His own blood.
29 I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.
30 Even from among your own number, men will arise, speaking perverse things to draw the disciples away after them.
31 Therefore, stay alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease to warn each of you with tears, night and day.


32 Now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
33 I have not coveted anyone’s silver or gold or clothing.
34 You yourselves know that these hands have provided for my needs and for those who were with me.
35 In everything, I have shown you that by working hard in this way, we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how He Himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”  


36 When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
37 They all wept freely and embraced Paul, kissing him,
38 grieving most of all because he had said that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.




Chapter 21


1 When we had torn ourselves away from them and set sail, we ran a straight course to Cos, then the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
2 Finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
3 After sighting Cyprus and passing to the south of it, we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre, where the ship was to unload its cargo.
4 We sought out the disciples there and stayed for seven days. Through the Spirit, they kept telling Paul not to go to Jerusalem.
5 But when our time there was up, we left and continued our journey. All of them, including their wives and children, accompanied us out of the city, and we knelt on the beach and prayed.
6 After saying farewell, we boarded the ship, and they returned home.  


7 We continued our voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day.
8 The next day, we left and came to Caesarea. There we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.
9 He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
10 While we were staying there for several days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
11 He came to us, took Paul's belt, bound his own feet and hands with it, and said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’”  


12 When we heard this, both we and the local residents urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
13 Then Paul answered, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”
14 Since he would not be persuaded, we said no more except, “The Lord’s will be done.”  


15 After those days, we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.
16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us and brought us to the home of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, where we were to stay.  


17 When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly.
18 The next day, Paul went with us to see James, and all the elders were present.
19 After greeting them, he reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
20 When they heard this, they glorified God and said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.
21 But they have been told about you—that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or follow our customs.
22 What should we do then? They will certainly hear that you have come.  


23 So do what we tell you: We have four men who have taken a vow.
24 Take these men, purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads. Then everyone will know that what they have heard about you is nothing, but that you yourself live in obedience to the law.
25 As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality.”
26 So the next day, Paul took the men, purified himself along with them, and entered the temple, giving notice of the completion of the days of purification, when the offering would be presented for each of them.  


27 When the seven days were nearly over, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and seized him,
28 shouting, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people, our law, and this place. And now he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place!”
29 For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
30 The whole city was stirred up, and the people rushed together. Seizing Paul, they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.  


31 As they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in turmoil.
32 He immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. When they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
33 Then the commander approached, arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He asked who he was and what he had done.
34 Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another. Since he could not determine the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks.
35 When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great that the soldiers had to carry him.
36 For the crowd kept shouting, “Away with him!”  


37 As he was about to be taken into the barracks, Paul said to the commander, “May I say something to you?”  


He replied, “Do you speak Greek?
38 Aren’t you the Egyptian who started a revolt some time ago and led four thousand men of the Assassins into the wilderness?”  


39 Paul answered, “I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, let me speak to the people.”
40 After receiving permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people for silence. When there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language.




Chapter 22


1 “Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense I now make before you.”  


2 When they heard that he was addressing them in Hebrew, they became even more silent. And he said:  


3 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strictness of our ancestral law, being zealous for God just as all of you are today.
4 I persecuted this Way to the death, arresting and imprisoning both men and women,
5 as the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me. I even received letters from them to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to bring those who were there as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.  


6 But as I was traveling and nearing Damascus, about noon, a great light from heaven suddenly flashed around me.
7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’
8 I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.’
9 Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one speaking to me.
10 I said, ‘What should I do, Lord?’ And the Lord told me, ‘Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told everything that has been assigned for you to do.’
11 Since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and entered Damascus.  


12 "Then a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,
13 came to me, stood by me, and said, ‘Brother Saul, regain your sight.’ And at that very moment, I looked up at him.
14 Then he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the words from his mouth.
15 For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.
16 And now, why are you delaying? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.’  


17 "When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance
18 and saw him saying to me, ‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’
19 But I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believe in you.
20 And when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I was standing by, approving, and guarding the garments of those who killed him.’
21 But he said to me, ‘Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”  


22 They listened to him up to this word. Then they raised their voices, shouting, “Away with such a man from the earth! He should not be allowed to live!”
23 As they were shouting, throwing off their cloaks, and flinging dust into the air,
24 the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, directing that he be interrogated under the whip to find out why they were shouting against him like this.  


25 But as they stretched him out for the lashes, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it lawful for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn’t been condemned?”
26 When the centurion heard this, he went and reported to the commander, saying, “What are you going to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.”
27 So the commander came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” He said, “Yes.”
28 The commander replied, “I bought my citizenship for a large sum.” Paul said, “But I was born a citizen.”
29 Immediately those who were about to interrogate him withdrew, and the commander himself was afraid when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had arrested him.


30 The next day, since he wanted to know exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul down and had him stand before them.




Chapter 23


1 Paul looked intently at the Council and said, “Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.”
2 But the high priest Ananias ordered those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.
3 Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?”
4 Those standing nearby said, “Do you dare to insult God’s high priest?”
5 Paul replied, “I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest; for it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’”  


6 When Paul perceived that one part of them were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the Council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead!”
7 When he said this, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
8 For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, nor angels, nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.
9 A great uproar ensued, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees’ party stood up and argued forcefully, saying, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”
10 When the dispute became so violent that the commander feared Paul would be torn apart by them, he ordered the soldiers to go down, take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.  


11 The following night, the Lord stood by him and said, “Take courage, for just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so also you must testify in Rome.”  


12 When morning came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under a curse, saying they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
13 More than forty men were involved in this plot.
14 They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.
15 Now then, you and the Council must request the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to examine his case more thoroughly. But we are ready to kill him before he gets here.”  


16 But the son of Paul’s sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered the barracks and reported it to Paul.
17 Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him.”
18 So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”
19 The commander took him by the hand, drew him aside, and asked, “What is it you have to report to me?”
20 He said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire more thoroughly about him.
21 But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty men are lying in wait for him. They have bound themselves under a curse not to eat or drink until they have killed him. Even now, they are ready, waiting for your consent.”
22 The commander dismissed the young man and instructed him, “Tell no one that you have informed me about this.”  


23 Then he called two of the centurions and said, “Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night.
24 Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, so that he may be safely brought to Governor Felix.”
25 He wrote a letter with this content:  


26 “Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.
27 This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, but I came with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.
28 Wanting to know the charge they were bringing against him, I brought him down to their Council.
29 I found that he was accused concerning questions of their law, but there was no charge deserving death or imprisonment.
30 When I was informed that there was a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to state their case against him before you.”  


31 So the soldiers took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris as they had been commanded.
32 The next day, they returned to the barracks, allowing the horsemen to continue with him.
33 When they arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and presented Paul to him.
34 After reading it, the governor asked what province he was from. When he learned that he was from Cilicia,
35 he said, “I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.




Chapter 24


1 After five days, the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought charges against Paul before the governor.
2 When Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “Since we have enjoyed much peace through you, and since reforms are being carried out for this nation by your foresight,
3 in every way and everywhere we acknowledge this with all gratitude, most excellent Felix.
4 But so that I do not weary you further, I beg you to grant us a brief hearing in your kindness.  


5 For we have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
6 He even tried to desecrate the temple, so we arrested him.
7 []
8 By examining him yourself, you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.”  


9 The Jews also joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were so.  


10 When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied, “Knowing that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly make my defense.
11 You can verify that it has not been more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.
12 They did not find me arguing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city.
13 Nor can they prove to you the accusations they are now making against me.  


14 But I confess this to you: according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and written in the Prophets.
15 I have a hope in God, which these men also accept, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
16 Because of this, I always strive to have a clear conscience before God and men.  


17 After several years, I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings.
18 While I was doing this, they found me in the temple, purified, without a crowd or disturbance.
19 But there are some Jews from Asia who ought to be here before you to bring charges, if they have anything against me.
20 Otherwise, let these men here state what wrongdoing they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin,
21 other than this one statement I shouted while standing among them: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”  


22 But Felix, who was well informed about the Way, adjourned the proceedings, saying, “When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case.”
23 He ordered the centurion to keep Paul in custody but to allow him some freedom and not to prevent his friends from attending to his needs.  


24 After some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.
25 As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and said, “Go away for now. When I find time, I will summon you.”
26 At the same time, he was hoping Paul would give him money, so he sent for him often and conversed with him.  


27 After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and because he wanted to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.




Chapter 25


1 Three days after Festus arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
2 The chief priests and the leading men of the Jews presented their case against Paul to him, and they urged him,
3 asking as a favor that he summon Paul to Jerusalem. They were planning to ambush and kill him along the way.
4 But Festus answered that Paul was being held in Caesarea and that he himself was about to go there soon.
5 “So,” he said, “let your influential men go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him.”  


6 After spending no more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea. The next day, taking his seat on the tribunal, he ordered Paul to be brought in.
7 When Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him that they could not prove.
8 Paul defended himself, saying, “I have committed no offense against the law of the Jews, against the temple, or against Caesar.”  


9 But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, responded to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried before me there on these charges?”
10 Paul replied, “I am standing before Caesar’s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you yourself well know.
11 If I am guilty and have done anything worthy of death, I do not seek to escape it. But if none of their charges against me are true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”
12 Then Festus, after conferring with his council, replied, “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go!”  


13 After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea to greet Festus.
14 Since they were staying there several days, Festus presented Paul’s case to the king, saying, “There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix.
15 When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.
16 I told them that it is not Roman custom to hand over any man before the accused has the opportunity to meet his accusers face to face and has a chance to make his defense concerning the charges.
17 So when they came here, I did not delay, but the next day I took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in.  


18 When his accusers stood up, they brought no charge against him of the crimes I was expecting.
19 Instead, they had some disputes with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who was dead but whom Paul claimed to be alive.
20 Being at a loss as to how to investigate these matters, I asked if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there.
21 But when Paul appealed to be held for the Emperor’s decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar.”  


22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he replied, “you will hear him.”  


23 So the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience hall with the military commanders and the prominent men of the city. At Festus’s order, Paul was brought in.
24 Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
25 But I found that he had done nothing worthy of death. Since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
26 But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore, I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this hearing I may have something to write.
27 For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without indicating the charges against him.”




Chapter 26


1 Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You are permitted to speak for yourself.”  


So Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense:  


2 “I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that I am about to make my defense before you today concerning all the accusations brought against me by the Jews,
3 especially since you are an expert in all Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.  


4 All the Jews know my manner of life from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem.
5 They have known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee.
6 And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our fathers,
7 the promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly serve God night and day. Because of this hope, O King, I am accused by the Jews.
8 Why is it considered incredible by you that God raises the dead?  


9 Indeed, I myself thought it was necessary to do many things in opposition to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
10 That is exactly what I did in Jerusalem. I locked up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.
11 I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to force them to blaspheme. In my extreme rage against them, I even pursued them to foreign cities.  


12 While I was traveling to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests,
13 at midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those traveling with me.
14 When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew language: ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’  


15 I said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’  


And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
16 But get up and stand on your feet. For I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you as a servant and a witness of what you have seen and of what I will reveal to you.
17 I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles—to whom I am sending you
18 to open their eyes, so they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.’  


19 Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
20 Instead, I proclaimed first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent, turn to God, and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds.
21 This is the reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.
22 But I have had God’s help to this day, and so I stand here testifying to both small and great, saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen—
23 that the Christ would suffer, and that by being the first to rise from the dead, He would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles.”  


24 As he was saying these things in his defense, Festus shouted, “You are out of your mind, Paul! Too much learning is driving you insane!”  


25 But Paul replied, “I am not insane, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking words of truth and sound judgment.
26 The king knows about these things, and I am speaking freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, since it was not done in a corner.
27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.”  


28 Then Agrippa said to Paul, “Are you trying to persuade me to become a Christian so quickly?”  


29 Paul replied, “Whether quickly or not, I pray to God that not only you but also all who are listening to me today might become as I am—except for these chains.”  


30 The king, the governor, Bernice, and those sitting with them stood up,
31 and when they had left, they said to one another, “This man is doing nothing deserving death or imprisonment.”  


32 Then Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”




Chapter 27


1 When it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they handed Paul and some other prisoners over to a centurion named Julius, of the Imperial Regiment.
2 Boarding a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to ports along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.
3 The next day we put in at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul kindly, allowing him to visit his friends and receive their care.  


4 Putting out to sea from there, we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
5 After crossing the open sea along the coasts of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.
6 There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.
7 Sailing slowly for many days and having difficulty arriving off Cnidus because the wind would not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the shelter of Crete off Salmone.
8 With difficulty, we coasted along and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.  


9 Since much time had passed and the voyage had become dangerous because even the Fast had already gone by, Paul warned them,
10 saying, “Men, I perceive that this voyage is going to result in damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives.”
11 But the centurion was more persuaded by the captain and the ship’s owner than by what Paul said.
12 Because the harbor was unsuitable for wintering, the majority decided to set sail from there, hoping to reach Phoenix and spend the winter there. It was a harbor of Crete, facing both southwest and northwest.  


13 When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained their goal. We weighed anchor and sailed close along the coast of Crete.
14 But soon a violent wind, called the Euraquilo, rushed down from the land.
15 The ship was caught and could not head into the wind, so we gave way and let it be driven along.
16 Running under the shelter of a small island called Cauda, we barely managed to secure the ship’s lifeboat.
17 After hoisting it up, they used ropes to undergird the ship. Then, fearing they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the drift anchor and were driven along.  


18 Because we were being violently battered by the storm, the next day they began to jettison the cargo.
19 On the third day, they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands.
20 When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued to rage, all hope of being saved was finally abandoned.  


21 Since they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not set sail from Crete, avoiding this damage and loss.
22 But now I urge you to take courage because there will be no loss of life among you, only of the ship.
23 For last night, an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood by me
24 and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. And indeed, God has graciously given you all those who are sailing with you.’
25 So take courage, men, because I believe God that it will happen just as it was told to me.
26 But we must run aground on some island.”  


27 When the fourteenth night came and we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected they were approaching land.
28 Taking soundings, they found the water to be twenty fathoms deep. A little farther on, they took another sounding and found it to be fifteen fathoms.
29 Fearing we would run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight to come.
30 Some of the sailors tried to escape from the ship. They let down the lifeboat into the sea, pretending they were going to lower anchors from the bow.
31 But Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.”
32 So the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat and let it drift away.  


33 As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to eat, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly watching and going without food, having eaten nothing.
34 So I urge you to take some food, for this is for your survival, since not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.”
35 After saying this, he took bread, gave thanks to God before them all, and broke it and began to eat.
36 Then they were all encouraged and took food themselves.
37 There were two hundred seventy-six of us on board.
38 When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.  


39 When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, where they planned to run the ship ashore if possible.
40 Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea while loosening the ropes of the rudders. Then, hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.
41 But they struck a sandbar and ran the ship aground. The bow stuck fast and remained immovable, while the stern was broken apart by the pounding waves.  


42 The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners so that none of them would swim away and escape.
43 But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, stopped them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land,
44 and the rest to follow, some on planks and some on debris from the ship. In this way, all were brought safely to land.




Chapter 28


1 After we had been brought safely through, we then learned that the island was called Malta.
2 The natives showed us extraordinary kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because of the rain that had started and because of the cold.
3 But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened onto his hand.
4 When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another, “Certainly this man is a murderer, and though he was rescued from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.”
5 However, he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.
6 They were expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began saying that he was a god.  


7 Now in the region around that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days.
8 It happened that the father of Publius was lying sick with fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him, prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
9 After this had happened, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed.
10 They honored us in many ways, and when we were about to set sail, they put on board whatever we needed.  


11 After three months, we set sail in a ship from Alexandria that had wintered at the island, which had the Twin Brothers as its figurehead.
12 Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.
13 From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.
14 There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days, and in this way we came to Rome.
15 The brothers there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.  


16 When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.
17 After three days, he called together the leading men of the Jews. When they had gathered, he said to them, “Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
18 When they examined me, they wanted to release me because there was no reason for me to be put to death.
19 But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar—not that I had any accusation to bring against my nation.
20 For this reason, I have requested to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”  


21 They said to him, “We have not received letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers who have come here has reported or spoken anything bad about you.
22 But we want to hear from you what you think, for concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.”  


23 When they had arranged a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in great numbers. From morning until evening, he explained and testified to them about the kingdom of God and tried to persuade them about Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets.
24 Some were convinced by what he said, but others refused to believe.
25 Being in disagreement with one another, they began to leave after Paul made one final statement: “The Holy Spirit rightly spoke to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet,
26 saying,  


‘Go to this people and say,  
“You will certainly hear but never understand,  
and you will certainly see but never perceive.”  
27 For the heart of this people has grown dull,  
and with their ears they barely hear,  
and their eyes they have closed,  
lest they should see with their eyes,  
hear with their ears,  
understand with their heart,  
and turn, and I would heal them.’  


28 Therefore, let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen.”  


30 Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented quarters and welcomed all who came to him,
31 proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.﻿The Epistle of Paul to the Romans


Chapter 1


1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
2 which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,
3 concerning His Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,
4 and who was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by His resurrection from the dead—Jesus Christ our Lord.
5 Through Him, we received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the nations for the sake of His name,
6 among whom you also are called to belong to Jesus Christ.  


7 To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  


8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world.
9 For God, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you,
10 always in my prayers, asking if perhaps now, at last, by God’s will, I may succeed in coming to you.
11 For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you—
12 that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.  


13 I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you (but have been prevented until now) so that I might have some fruit among you as well, just as among the rest of the Gentiles.
14 I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.
15 So, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.  


16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes—to the Jew first and also to the Gentile.
17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written: “The righteous shall live by faith.”


18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
19 For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.
20 For since the creation of the world, His invisible attributes—His eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that they are without excuse.  


21 For although they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools,
23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.  


24 Therefore, God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,
25 because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.  


26 For this reason, God gave them over to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature,
27 and likewise the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed in their lust for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.  


28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do what ought not to be done.
29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, and malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice. They are gossips,
30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,
31 senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
32 Though they know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve death, they not only do them but also approve of those who practice them.




Chapter 2


1 So you have no excuse, O man—whoever you are—when you judge. For in passing judgment on another, you condemn yourself, because you, who judge, practice the same things.
2 Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.
3 But do you think, O man—when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape God’s judgment?
4 Or do you despise the riches of His kindness, restraint, and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?
5 But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.  


6 He will repay each one according to his works—
7 to those who persist in doing good, seeking glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.
8 But for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.
9 There will be trouble and distress for every man who does evil, first for the Jew, then for the Greek,
10 but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, first for the Jew, then for the Greek.
11 For there is no partiality with God.  


12 All who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law.
13 For it is not those who hear the Law who are righteous before God, but those who do the Law who will be justified.
14 For when Gentiles, who do not have the Law, by nature do what the Law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the Law.
15 They show that the work of the Law is written on their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or even defending them
16 on the day when God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus, according to my gospel.  


17 But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the Law and boast in God,
18 and know His will and approve what is excellent because you are instructed from the Law,
19 and if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness,
20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—
21 you then, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
22 You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples?
23 You who boast in the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?
24 For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”  


25 Circumcision indeed has value if you practice the Law, but if you break the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
26 So if an uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision?
27 The one who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the Law will condemn you, who have the written code and circumcision yet break the Law.
28 For a Jew is not one outwardly, nor is circumcision something merely outward in the flesh.
29 But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from men, but from God.




Chapter 3


1 What advantage, then, does the Jew have? Or what benefit is there in circumcision?
2 Much in every way! First of all, they were entrusted with the very words of God.
3 But what if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s faithfulness?
4 Absolutely not! Let God be true, though every man be a liar, as it is written:  


   “That You may be justified in Your words  
   and prevail when You are judged.”  


5 But if our unrighteousness highlights God’s righteousness, what shall we say? Is God unjust to inflict wrath? (I am speaking in human terms.)
6 Absolutely not! Otherwise, how will God judge the world?
7 But if through my lie God’s truth abounds to His glory, why am I still judged as a sinner?
8 And why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—“Let us do evil so that good may come”? Their condemnation is deserved.  


9 What then? Are we any better off? Not at all! For we have already charged that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin.
10 As it is written:  


   “There is no one righteous, not even one;  
   11 there is no one who understands,  
   there is no one who seeks God.  
   12 All have turned away, together they have become worthless;  
   there is no one who does good, not even one.”  


13 “Their throat is an open grave;  
   with their tongues they practice deceit.”  


   “The venom of asps is under their lips.”  


14 “Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.”  


15 “Their feet are swift to shed blood;  
   16 ruin and misery mark their ways,  
   17 and the path of peace they have not known.”  


18 “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”  


19 Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those under the Law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world may be held accountable to God.
20 For by the works of the Law, no flesh will be justified in His sight, but through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.  


21 But now, apart from the Law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified to by the Law and the Prophets—
22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe, for there is no distinction.
23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
24 and they are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
25 God presented Him as a propitiation through faith in His blood, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance, He passed over the sins previously committed.
26 It was to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.  


27 Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.
28 For we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.
29 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not also the God of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles also,
30 since God is one, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.
31 Do we then nullify the Law through faith? Absolutely not! Instead, we uphold the Law.




Chapter 4


1 What then shall we say, that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?
2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about—but not before God.
3 For what does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”  


4 Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift, but as something owed.
5 But to the one who does not work but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.
6 Just as David also speaks of the blessing of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:  


7 “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven,  
and whose sins are covered;  
8 blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count sin.”  


9 Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.
10 How then was it credited? While he was circumcised or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised.
11 And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness he had by faith while still uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness might be credited to them as well,
12 and the father of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also follow in the steps of the faith that our father Abraham had while he was still uncircumcised.  


13 For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
14 For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made empty and the promise is nullified.
15 For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law, there is no transgression.  


16 That is why it is by faith, so that it may be according to grace, to ensure the promise to all his offspring—not only to those of the law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
17 As it is written: “I have made you the father of many nations.” He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the dead and calls things into existence that do not exist.
18 Against hope, he believed in hope, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was spoken: “So shall your offspring be.”  


19 He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was already as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.
20 He did not waver in unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,
21 being fully convinced that what God had promised, He was also able to do.
22 That is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”  


23 But the words “it was credited to him” were not written for him alone,
24 but also for us, to whom it will be credited—to those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
25 He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.




Chapter 5


1 Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Through him, we also have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
3 Not only that, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
4 and endurance produces character, and character produces hope.
5 And hope does not put us to shame, because the love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.  


6 For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
7 For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for a good man someone might even dare to die.
8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
9 Much more, then, since we have now been justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
10 For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
11 Not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.  


12 Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death spread to all men, because all sinned.
13 For sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged where there is no law.
14 Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is a type of the one who was to come.  


15 But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if by the trespass of one man many died, much more has the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.
16 And the gift is not like what came through the one who sinned. For judgment from one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification.
17 For if by the trespass of one man death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.  


18 So then, just as through one trespass condemnation came to all men, so also through one righteous act justification and life came to all men.
19 For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man many will be made righteous.
20 Now the law came in so that the trespass might increase, but where sin increased, grace increased all the more,
21 so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.




Chapter 6


1 What shall we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may increase?
2 Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it?
3 Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?
4 Therefore, we were buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.  


5 For if we have been united with Him in the likeness of His death, we will certainly also be in the likeness of His resurrection.
6 We know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin—
7 for the one who has died is freed from sin.
8 Now, if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him,
9 knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over Him.
10 For the death He died, He died to sin once for all, but the life He lives, He lives to God.
11 So you too must consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.  


12 Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires.
13 Do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness.
14 For sin will not have dominion over you, because you are not under law but under grace.  


15 What then? Should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!
16 Do you not know that when you present yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—either of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?
17 But thanks be to God that, though you were slaves of sin, you obeyed from the heart the pattern of teaching to which you were handed over,
18 and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.  


19 I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. Just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.
20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness.
21 So what fruit did you have then from the things you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death.
22 But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit leading to sanctification, and the end is eternal life.
23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.




Chapter 7


1 Do you not know, brothers—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law has authority over a man as long as he lives?
2 For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning her husband.
3 So then, if she is joined to another man while her husband is still alive, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress if she marries another man.  


4 In the same way, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another—to Him who was raised from the dead—in order that we might bear fruit for God.
5 For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, bearing fruit for death.
6 But now we have been released from the law, having died to what held us, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.  


7 What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! But I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting was if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”
8 But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.
9 Once I was alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came to life, and I died.
10 The very commandment that was meant to bring life resulted in death for me.
11 For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.
12 So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.  


13 Did what is good, then, bring death to me? Absolutely not! But sin, in order to be recognized as sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.  


14 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.
15 For I do not understand what I am doing. For I do not do what I want, but I do what I hate.
16 Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law that it is good.
17 But now, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.
18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For the desire to do what is right is present in me, but the ability to carry it out is not.
19 For I do not do the good I want, but I practice the evil I do not want.
20 Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.  


21 So I find this principle at work: When I want to do what is right, evil is present with me.
22 For in my inner being, I delight in the law of God,
23 but I see a different law at work in my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me captive to the law of sin that is in my body.
24 Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?
25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh, the law of sin.




Chapter 8


1 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.
3 For what the Law could not do, since it was weak through the flesh, God did—by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as a sin offering, He condemned sin in the flesh,
4 so that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.  


5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.
6 For the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace.
7 For the mindset of the flesh is hostile toward God, for it does not submit to the Law of God, nor can it do so.
8 And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.  


9 However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.
10 But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
11 And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.  


12 So then, brothers, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
13 For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
15 For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, "Abba, Father!"
16 The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God.
17 And if children, then heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.  


18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
19 For the creation eagerly waits in expectation for the revealing of the sons of God.
20 For the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it—in hope
21 that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of the children of God.
22 For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in labor pains until now.
23 And not only that, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, also groan within ourselves as we eagerly await adoption, the redemption of our bodies.
24 For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is not hope, for who hopes for what he already sees?
25 But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.  


26 Likewise, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes with inexpressible groanings.
27 And He who searches hearts knows the mindset of the Spirit, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.  


28 And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to His purpose.
29 For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He might be the firstborn among many brothers.
30 And those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified; and those whom He justified, He also glorified.  


31 What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
32 He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all things?
33 Who will bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.
34 Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is also at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us.
35 Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?  


36 As it is written: "For Your sake we are being put to death all day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered."  


37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.
38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor rulers, neither things present nor things to come, nor powers,
39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.




Chapter 9


1 I am speaking the truth in Christ—I am not lying; my conscience bears witness with me in the Holy Spirit—
2 that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
3 For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh.
4 They are Israelites, to whom belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, the temple service, and the promises.
5 To them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, came the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.  


6 But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are truly Israel,
7 nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants. Instead, “Through Isaac your descendants shall be named.”
8 That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.
9 For this is what the promise said: “At this time I will return, and Sarah shall have a son.”  


10 Not only that, but also when Rebekah conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac—
11 though they had not yet been born and had done neither good nor evil, so that God’s purpose in election might stand, not because of works but because of him who calls—
12 it was said to her, “The older shall serve the younger.”
13 As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”  


14 What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Certainly not!
15 For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
16 So then, it depends not on man’s desire or effort, but on God who shows mercy.
17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very reason I raised you up, that I might display my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”
18 So then, he has mercy on whom he wills, and he hardens whom he wills.  


19 You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?”
20 But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, “Why have you made me like this?”
21 Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?
22 What if God, willing to demonstrate his wrath and make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,
23 in order to make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory—
24 even us whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?  


25 As he says in Hosea, “I will call those who were not my people, ‘My people,’ and her who was not beloved, ‘Beloved.’”
26 And in the very place where it was said to them, “You are not my people,” there they shall be called “sons of the living God.”  


27 And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
28 For the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and decisively.”
29 And as Isaiah foretold, “If the Lord of Hosts had not left us offspring, we would have become like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.”  


30 What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness—that is, a righteousness that comes by faith—
31 but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain it?
32 Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,
33 as it is written: “Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”




Chapter 10


1 Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.
2 For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
3 For being ignorant of the righteousness of God and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to the righteousness of God.
4 For Christ is the culmination of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.  


5 For Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: “The man who does these things will live by them.”
6 But the righteousness that is from faith speaks like this: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down)
7 or, “‘Who will descend into the abyss?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart”—that is, the word of faith that we proclaim.
9 Because if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses unto salvation.
11 For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.”  


12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, richly blessing all who call on him.
13 For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
14 How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without someone preaching?
15 And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”  


16 But not all have obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”
17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.
18 But I say, have they not heard? Indeed they have:  


  “Their voice has gone out into all the earth,  
  and their words to the ends of the world.”  


19 But I say, did Israel not understand? First, Moses says,  


  “I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation;  
  I will make you angry by a foolish nation.”  


20 And Isaiah is even more bold and says,  


  “I was found by those who did not seek me;  
  I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.”  


21 But to Israel he says, “All day long I have stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”




Chapter 11


1 I ask, then, has God rejected His people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
2 God has not rejected His people whom He knew in advance. Do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?
3 “Lord, they have killed Your prophets, they have torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.”
4 But what is God’s response to him? “I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
5 In the same way, at the present time, there is a remnant chosen by grace.
6 And if it is by grace, it is no longer by works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.  


7 What then? What Israel was seeking, it did not obtain, but the elect obtained it, and the rest were hardened,
8 as it is written:  


   “God gave them a spirit of stupor,  
   eyes that would not see  
   and ears that would not hear,  
   down to this very day.”  


9 And David says,  


   “Let their table become a snare and a trap,  
   a stumbling block and a retribution for them.  
   10 Let their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,  
   and bend their backs forever.”  


11 So I ask, did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? By no means! But salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous, and it’s Israel’s own fault.
12 Now if by their fault the world is enriched, and their failure benefits the Gentiles, how much more will their obedience bring?  


13 Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,
14 in the hope that I may somehow make my own people jealous and save some of them.
15 For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?
16 If the first portion of dough is holy, so is the whole lump; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.  


17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and have become a partaker of the rich root of the olive tree,
18 do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember that it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.
19 You will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”
20 That is true. They were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but stand in reverence.
21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you.
22 Consider then the kindness and severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but kindness toward you—provided you continue in His kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off.
23 And they also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted back in, for God is able to graft them in again.
24 For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and were grafted—contrary to nature—into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree?  


25 For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be wise in your own estimation: a partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.
26 And in this way, all Israel will be saved, as it is written:  


   “The Deliverer will come from Zion,  
   He will remove ungodliness from Jacob.”  
   27 “And this is My covenant with them  
   when I take away their sins.”  


28 As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake, but as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of the fathers.
29 For the gifts and calling of God are irrevocable.
30 Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,
31 so, they too have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they also may now receive mercy.
32 For God has consigned all to disobedience so that He may have mercy on all.  


33 Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and how inscrutable His ways!  


   34 “For who has known the mind of the Lord,  
   or who has been His counselor?”  
   35 “Or who has given to Him,  
   that He should be repaid?”  


36 For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.




Chapter 12


1 I appeal to you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice—holy and pleasing to God—which is your rational act of worship.  
2 Do not conform to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.


3. For by the grace given to me I say to every man among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought, but rather to think with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith that God has assigned to each.  
4 For as in one body we have many members, and not all the members have the same function,  
5 so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another.  
6 Let us use the different gifts that we have, according to the grace given to us: if prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith;  
7 if service, let us serve; if teaching, let us teach;  
8 if exhortation, let us exhort; if giving, let us give generously; if leadership, let us lead diligently; if mercy, let us show it cheerfully.


9 Let love be genuine; abhor what is evil and cling to what is good.  
10 Love one another with mutual affection; outdo one another in showing honor.  
11 Do not lag in zeal, but be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.  
12 Rejoice in hope, be patient in affliction, be constant in prayer.  
13 Contribute to the needs of the saints; practice hospitality toward strangers.


14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.  
15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.  
16 Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly; do not be wise in your own estimation.


17 Repay no one evil for evil; rather, do the right thing in the sight of all.  
18 If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live at peace with all men.  
19 Beloved, do not take vengeance, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay,” says the Lord.  
20 On the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink;” for by doing so you will heap burning coals upon his head.  
21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.




Chapter 13


1 Every person must submit to the governing authorities. There is no authority unless it comes from God, and the ones that exist have been appointed by God.  
2 So then, the one who resists authority is opposing what God has established, and those who oppose will bring judgment on themselves.  
3 For rulers are not a cause of fear for good conduct, but for bad. Do you want to live without fear of authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive approval from it,  
4 for they are God’s servant for your benefit. But if you do wrong, be afraid, because they do not carry a sword for nothing. They are God’s servant, an avenger to bring wrath on the one who does evil.  
5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit, not only because of wrath, but also for the sake of conscience.  


6 This is also why you pay taxes, because the authorities are servants of God, continually attending to this very thing.  
7 Pay what is owed to everyone: taxes to whom taxes are due, tolls to whom tolls are due, respect to whom respect is due, and honor to whom honor is due.  


8 Owe nothing to anyone, except to love one another, for the one who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.  
9 For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,” and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”  
10 Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law.  


11 And do this, knowing the time: it is already the hour for you to wake up from sleep, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.  
12 The night is nearly over, and the day is approaching. So then, let us throw off the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.  
13 Let us walk properly, as in the daytime—not in wild partying and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and unrestrained behavior, not in quarreling and jealousy.  
14 Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires.




Chapter 14


1 Accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of arguing over opinions.  
2 One man believes he may eat anything, while the weak man eats only vegetables.  
3 The one who eats must not look down on the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat must not judge the one who eats—for God has accepted him.  
4 Who are you to judge another man's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.  


5 One man regards one day as more important than another; another regards every day alike. Each man must be fully convinced in his own mind.  
6 The one who observes the day, observes it for the Lord. The one who eats, eats for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God. And the one who does not eat, abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God.  


7 For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.  
8 If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s.  
9 For this reason Christ died and returned to life—that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living.  


10 But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you treat your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.  
11 For it is written: “As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.”  
12 So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.  


13 Therefore let us no longer judge one another. Instead, decide never to put a stumbling block or a trap in your brother’s way.  
14 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone considers something to be unclean, for him it is unclean.  
15 For if your brother is distressed because of food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died.  
16 So do not let what is good for you be spoken of as evil.  


17 For the kingdom of God is not about food and drink, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.  
18 For the one who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.  
19 So then, let us pursue what promotes peace and what builds one another up.  


20 Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat if it causes offense.  
21 It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.  
22 The faith that you have—keep it between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself in what he approves.  
23 But the one who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not from faith. And whatever is not from faith is sin.




Chapter 15


1 We who are strong ought to bear with the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not to please ourselves.  
2 Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.  
3 For even Christ did not please himself; instead, as it is written, “The insults of those who insult you fell on me.”  
4 For whatever was written beforehand was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope.  
5 Now may the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another, according to Christ Jesus,  
6 so that with one accord, you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with one voice.


7 Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted you, to the glory of God.  
8 For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcised on behalf of God’s truth, in order to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs,  
9 and so that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, “For this reason I will praise you among the Gentiles and sing to your name.”  
10 And again it says, “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people.”  
11 And again, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him.”  
12 And again Isaiah says, “The root of Jesse will come, and he who rises to rule the Gentiles—in him the Gentiles will hope.”  
13 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.


14 I myself am convinced about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able also to instruct one another.  
15 But I have written to you more boldly on some points, as a reminder to you, because of the grace given to me by God  
16 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.  
17 Therefore, I have reason to boast in Christ Jesus about the things that pertain to God.  
18 For I would not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience—by word and deed,  
19 by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.  
20 And in this way I make it my ambition to preach the gospel in places where Christ has not yet been preached, so that I would not build on another man’s foundation,  
21 but as it is written, “Those who had no report of him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”


22 This is the reason I have been hindered many times from coming to you.  
23 But now, since I no longer have room to work in these regions, and since I have desired for many years to come to you,  
24 I hope to see you as I pass through on my way to Spain, and to be helped on my journey there by you, once I have first enjoyed being with you for a while.  
25 But now I am going to Jerusalem, bringing aid to the saints.  
26 For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.  
27 For they were pleased to do so, and indeed they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they are also obligated to minister to them in material things.  
28 Therefore, after I have completed this and have sealed this fruit to them, I will go on by way of you to Spain.  
29 I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.


30 Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf,  
31 that I may be rescued from those in Judea who are disobedient, and that my ministry for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,  
32 so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company.  
33 May the God of peace be with you all. Amen.




Chapter 16


1 I recommend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church in Cenchreae,  
2 so that you may welcome her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and provide her with any help she may need from you. For she has been a benefactor of many, including me.  


3 Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,  
4 who risked their own necks for my life. Not only I, but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.  
5 Greet also the church that meets in their house.  


Greet my dear friend Epaenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in Asia.  
6 Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.  
7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and fellow prisoners. They are well known among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.  


8 Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.  
9 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.  
10 Greet Apelles, who has been tested and approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.  
11 Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.  
12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who work hard in the Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who has worked very hard in the Lord.  
13 Greet Rufus, a chosen man in the Lord, and his mother—who has been like a mother to me as well.  


14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers with them.  
15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them.  
16 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.  


17 Now I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the teaching you have learned. Avoid them.  
18 For such men do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.  


19 Your obedience has become known to all, so I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil.  
20 The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.  


21 Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen.  
22 I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.  
23 Gaius, who is host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus greet you.  


25 Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept silent for long ages,  
26 but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God to bring about the obedience of faith among all the nations—  
27 to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory forever. Amen.﻿Paul’s First Epistle to the Corinthians


Chapter 1


1 Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,  
2 to the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours:  
3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.


4 I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus,  
5 that in every way you were enriched in him—in all speech and all knowledge—  
6 just as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you,  
7 so that you do not lack any gift as you wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
8 He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
9 God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.


10 I urge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mindset and the same conviction.  
11 For it has been reported to me by Chloe’s people that there are quarrels among you, my brothers.  
12 What I mean is this: each of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.”  
13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?  
14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,  
15 so that no one can say you were baptized in my name.  
16 (I did baptize the household of Stephanas too; but beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.)
17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—though not with eloquent wisdom, so the cross of Christ would not be emptied of its power.


18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.  
19 For it is written:  
 “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,  
 and I will frustrate the understanding of the intelligent.”  
20 Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made the world’s wisdom foolish?  
21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God because of wisdom, God was pleased through the foolishness of what is preached to save those who believe.  
22 For Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom,  
23 but we preach Christ crucified—a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.  
24 But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.


26 Consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.  
27 But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.  
28 God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not valued, to bring to nothing things that are,  
29 so that no man may boast in God’s presence.  
30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption—  
31 so that, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”




Chapter 2


1 When I came to you, brothers, I didn’t come with impressive speech or wisdom as I proclaimed to you the mystery of God.  
2 I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ—and Him crucified.  
3 I was with you in weakness, in fear, and with much trembling.  
4 My message and my preaching weren’t delivered with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,  
5 so that your faith wouldn’t rest on human wisdom but on God’s power.


6 Now we do speak wisdom among the mature—but not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are passing away.  
7 Instead, we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom God appointed ahead of time, before the world began, for our glory.  
8 None of the rulers of this age understood it, because if they had, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of glory.
9 But as it is written:  
 “What no eye has seen,  
 what no ear has heard,  
 and what hasn’t entered the human heart—  
 God has prepared these things for those who love Him.”


10 Now God has revealed them to us by the Spirit, because the Spirit searches everything—even the depths of God.  
11 For who among men knows a man’s thoughts except the spirit of the man within him? In the same way, no one knows God’s thoughts except the Spirit of God.  
12 Now we haven’t received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God.  
13 We also speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual men.


14 But the natural man doesn’t accept what comes from the Spirit of God, because it’s foolishness to him. He can’t understand it, because it is spiritually investigated.
15 The spiritual man, however, evaluates everything, but he himself is not evaluated by anyone.  
16 For who has known the mind of the Lord so that he can instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.




Chapter 3


1 Brothers, I could not speak to you as spiritual men but as men of the flesh, as infants in Christ.
2 I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you weren’t ready for it. And even now, you’re still not ready,
3 because you’re still of the flesh. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, aren’t you of the flesh, and living like ordinary men?
4 For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you acting like mere men?


5 What then is Apollos, and what is Paul, exceept servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord assigned tasks to each of us.
6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God produced the growth.
7 So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but what is important is God who produces growth.
8 Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.  
9 For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.


10 According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another built on it. But each man must be careful how he builds.  
11 For no one can lay a true foundation other than what is already laid, which is Jesus Christ.
12 Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,
13 each one’s work will become evident, for the Day will show it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man’s work.
14 If what someone has built survives, he will receive a reward.
15 If someone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved—though only as through fire.


16 Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?  
17 Since you are God’s temple, if anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him, for God’s temple is holy.


18 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, he must become a fool so that he may become wise.  
19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God, as it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness,”  
20 and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”  
21 So then, let no one boast in men. For all things are yours—  
22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or the present or the future—all are yours,  
23 and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.




Chapter 4


1 Let a man regard us in this way: as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.  
2 Moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy.  
3 But to me it matters very little if I’m judged by you or by any human court; in fact, I don’t even judge myself.  
4 For I am not aware of anything against myself, yet I’m not justified by this—rather, the one who judges me is the Lord.  
5 So don’t pronounce judgment ahead of time—wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what’s hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of hearts. Then each man will receive his praise from God.


6 Now, brothers, I’ve applied these things to myself and Apollos for your sake, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written, so that none of you becomes arrogant, favoring one person over another.  
7 For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you didn’t receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you hadn’t?


8 You’re already full! You’re already rich! You’ve begun to reign without us—and I wish you really were reigning, so that we might reign with you!  
9 For I think God has put us apostles on display last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we’ve become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.  
10 We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored.  
11 To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we’re poorly clothed, roughly treated, and homeless.  
12 We labor, working with our own hands. When we’re insulted, we bless; when we’re persecuted, we endure it;  
13 when we’re slandered, we answer kindly. We’ve become like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things, to this very moment.


14 I’m not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.  
15 For even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you wouldn’t have many fathers—for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.  
16 So I urge you: be imitators of me.  
17 That’s why I sent Timothy to you—he’s my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He’ll remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach them everywhere in every church.


18 Some of you have become arrogant, as if I weren’t coming to you.  
19 But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I’ll find out not the talk of these arrogant ones but their power.  
20 For the kingdom of God isn’t about talk, but power.  
21 What do you want? Should I come to you with a rod, or with love and a gentle spirit?




Chapter 5


1 It’s widely reported that there’s sexual immorality among you, and it's the kind that doesn’t even happen among the pagans—a man has his father’s wife.  
2 And you’re proud of yourselves? You should’ve been mourning instead, so that the one who did this would be removed from among you.  
3 Even though I’m not physically there, I’m with you in spirit—and I’ve already passed judgment on the one who did this, as though I were there in person.  
4 When you gather in the name of our Lord Jesus—and I’m with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus—  
5 hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.  


6 Your boasting isn’t good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough?  
7 Clean out the old yeast so that you can be a new batch, just as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.  
8 So let’s celebrate the feast, not with old yeast—the yeast of malice and evil—but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.  


9 I wrote to you in my previous letter not to associate with sexually immoral men.  
10 I wasn’t talking about the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy, or swindlers, or idolaters—otherwise, you’d have to leave the world altogether.  
11 But now I’m writing you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother and yet is sexually immoral, greedy, an idolater, a slanderer, a drunkard, or a swindler. Don’t even eat with such a man.  


12 For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders? Aren’t you supposed to judge those who are inside?  
13 God will judge those outside. “Remove the wicked man from among you.”




Chapter 6




1 If one of you has a dispute with another, how dare he take it to court before the unrighteous instead of before the saints?  
2 Don’t you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, aren’t you competent to judge trivial cases?  
3 Don’t you know that we will judge angels—how much more matters of this life?  
4 So if you have cases involving everyday life, do you appoint those with no standing in the church to judge?  
5 I say this to shame you. Is there really no one wise among you who is able to arbitrate between his brothers?  
6 Instead, brother goes to court against brother—and that before unbelievers!


7 Already, then, it’s a complete failure for you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?  
8 Instead, you yourselves do wrong and cheat—and that to your own brothers!


9 Don’t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Don’t be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,  
10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.  
11 And some of you were like that. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.


12 “All things are permissible for me”—but not all things are beneficial. “All things are permissible for me”—but I will not be controlled by anything.  
13 “Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.  
14 God raised the Lord and will also raise us by His power.


15 Don’t you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Absolutely not!  
16 Don’t you know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For it is written, “The two will become one flesh.”  
17 But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him.


18 Run away from sexual immorality! Every other sin a man commits is outside the body, but the one who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.  
19 Don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own;  
20 you were bought at a price. So glorify God with your body.




Chapter 7


1 Now, regarding what you wrote about: It’s good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.
2 But because sexual immorality is so common, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.


3 A husband must fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise a wife to her husband.
4 A wife does not have authority over her own body—her husband does. Likewise, a husband does not have authority over his own body—his wife does.
5 Do not deprive one another—except by mutual agreement for a set time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come back together, so that Satan doesn’t tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
6 I’m saying this as a concession, not as a command.
7 I wish all men were like me, but each has his own gift from God—one this way, another that way.


8 To the unmarried and to widows I say: it’s good for them to stay single as I am.
9 But if they can’t control themselves, they should get married. It’s better to marry than to burn with desire.


10 To the married I give this command—not I, but the Lord: a wife must not separate from her husband.
11 But if she does separate, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.


12 To the rest I say—I, not the Lord: if a brother has a wife who isn’t a believer, and she’s willing to stay with him, he shouldn’t divorce her.
13 Likewise, if a woman has a husband who isn’t a believer, and he’s willing to stay with her, she shouldn’t divorce him.
14 For the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
15 But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. The brother or sister is not bound in such cases. God has called us to live in peace.
16 For how do you know, wife, whether you’ll save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you’ll save your wife?


17 Only, let each person lead the life the Lord has assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is what I command in all the churches.
18 Was someone already circumcised when he was called? He shouldn’t try to reverse it. Was someone uncircumcised when he was called? He shouldn’t get circumcised.
19 Circumcision means nothing, and uncircumcision means nothing. What matters is keeping God’s commandments.


20 Each man should remain in the condition he was in when God called him.
21 Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t let it bother you—but if you can gain your freedom, take the opportunity.
22 For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise, he who was free when called is Christ’s slave.
23 You were bought at a price. Don’t become slaves of men.
24 Brothers, each of you should remain before God in the condition in which he was called.


25 Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.
26 Because of the present distress, I think it’s good for a man to remain as he is.
27 Are you bound to a wife? Don’t seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Don’t seek a wife.
28 But if you do marry, you haven’t sinned; and if a virgin marries, she hasn’t sinned. Yet those who marry will face trouble in this life, and I want to spare you that.


29 This is what I mean, brothers: the time is short. From now on, those who have wives should live as though they had none,
30 those who weep as though they didn’t weep, those who rejoice as though they didn’t rejoice, those who buy as though they didn’t own anything,
31 and those who use the world as though they weren’t engrossed in it. For the present form of this world is passing away.


32 I want you to be free from distractions. The unmarried man is concerned with the things of the Lord—how to please the Lord.
33 But the married man is concerned with the things of the world—how to please his wife—
34 and so his interests are divided. The unmarried woman or virgin is concerned with the things of the Lord—so she can be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is concerned with the things of the world—how to please her husband.


35 I’m saying this for your own benefit—not to restrict you, but to promote proper behavior and undivided devotion to the Lord.
36 If a man thinks he’s acting improperly toward the woman he is engaged to, and if she’s past the age for marriage and it has to happen, let him do what he wants—he’s not sinning. Let them marry.
37 But the one who stands firm in his heart—not under pressure, and with control over his own will—and has decided in his own mind to not marry, he will also do well.
38 So then, he who marries his girlfriend does well, and he who does not marry her does even better.


39 A wife is bound as long as her husband lives. But if her husband dies, she’s free to marry whomever she wants—only in the Lord.
40 But in my opinion, she would be happier if she stays as she is—and I think I also have the Spirit of God.




Chapter 8


1 Now concerning food sacrificed to idols: we know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.  
2 If anyone thinks he knows something, he has not yet come to know as he ought to know.  
3 But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.


4 So then, concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is only one God.  
5 For even if there were so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”—  
6 yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came to be, and through whom we exist.


7 However, not all have this knowledge. But some, being accustomed to idols until now, eat food as though it were sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.  
8 Now food will not bring us closer to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.  
9 But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.  
10 For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols?  
11 And so by your knowledge, the weak man, the brother for whom Christ died, is destroyed.  
12 And thus, by sinning against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.  
13 Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.




Chapter 9


1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?  
2 If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you—for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.  
3 This is my defense to those who examine me:  
4 Do we not have the right to eat and drink?  
5 Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as the other apostles do, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?  
6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?


7 Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink the milk from the flock?  
8 Am I saying this from a merely human perspective? Doesn't the law also say these things?  
9 For it is written in the Law of Moses: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is God concerned about oxen?  
10 Or is He saying this entirely for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.  
11 If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?  
12 If others have this rightful claim over you, do we not even more? Yet we did not make use of this right. Instead, we endure everything so that we may not put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.


13 Do you not know that those who perform the sacred duties eat from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is sacrificed on the altar?  
14 In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living from the gospel.  
15 But I have not used any of these rights, and I am not writing this so that anything may be done for me. For I would rather die than let anyone deprive me of my boast.  
16 For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because I am under compulsion. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!  
17 For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.  
18 What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, so that I do not make full use of my rights in the gospel.


19 For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, so that I might win more converts.
20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, so that I might win Jews. To those under the law, I became like one under the law—though not being under the law myself—so that I might win those under the law.  
21 To those without the law, I became like one without the law—though not being without God’s law but under Christ’s law—so that I might win those without the law.  
22 To the weak I became weak, so that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, so that by all means I might save some.  
23 I do all this for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings.


24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it.  
25 Everyone who competes exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we do it for an imperishable one.  
26 So I do not run aimlessly, nor do I box as one beating the air.  
27 But I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself may not be disqualified.




Chapter 10


1 For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, all passed through the sea,
2 and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
3 They all ate the same spiritual food,
4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they were drinking from a spiritual rock that followed them—and that rock was Christ.
5 Yet God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness.


6 Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not desire evil things as they did.
7 Do not become idolaters as some of them were, as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play.”
8 Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, after which twenty-three thousand of them fell in a single day.
9 Nor let us put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by serpents.
10 Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer.


11 These things happened to them as an example, and were written down for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.
12 So let the one who thinks he stands watch out, so that he does not fall.
13 No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to man. But God is faithful, he will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also provide a way of escape so that you may be able to endure it.


14 Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
15 I speak as to sensible men; judge for yourselves what I say.
16 Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ?
17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.
18 Consider Israel according to the flesh: are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?


19 What then am I saying? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
20 No, but that what the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God—and I do not want you to become partners with demons.
21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
22 Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?


23 “All things are lawful,” but not all things are beneficial. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up.
24 Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor.
25 Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising questions for the sake of conscience,
26 for “the earth is the Lord’s, and all it contains.”
27 If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising questions for the sake of conscience.
28 But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you and for the sake of conscience—
29 not your own conscience, but that of the other. For why should my liberty be judged by another’s conscience?
30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?


31 Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
32 Give no offense to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God,
33 just as I also try to please everyone in everything, not seeking my own advantage but that of the many, so that they may be saved.




Chapter 11


1 Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.


2 Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions just as I delivered them to you.
3 But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of a woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.
4 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.
5 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for she is just like a woman whose head is shaved.
6 For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also cut her hair off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or her head shaved, let her cover her head.
7 But a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; while the woman is the glory of man.
8 For man was not created from woman, but woman from man.
9 For indeed man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.
10 Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.


11 However, in the Lord, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
12 For just as the woman is from the man, so also the man is through the woman; and all things are from God.
13 Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
14 Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,
15 but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
16 But if anyone is being argumentative about this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.


17 But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.
18 For in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you, and in part I believe it.
19 For there must be factions among you, so that those who are the true believers may be revealed.


20 Therefore when you assemble together, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper,
21 for in eating, each one takes his own food first, and one is hungry while another is drunk.
22 Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you.


23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which He was betrayed, took bread;
24 and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”
25 In the same way, He also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”
26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.


27 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
28 But let a man examine himself carefully, and then let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
29 For the one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment to himself.


30 For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.
31 But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.
32 But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.


33 So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
34 If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you do not come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when I come.




Chapter 12


1 Now, concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed.  
2 You know that when you were Gentiles, you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led.  
3 Therefore, I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.


4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit;  
5 and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord;  
6 and there are varieties of works, but it is the same God who works all things in all.  
7 But to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.  
8 For to one is given through the Spirit a word of wisdom, to another a word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,  
9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the one Spirit,  
10 to another, workings of miracles, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.  
11 But the one and same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.


12 For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so also is Christ.  
13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and we were all given to drink of one Spirit.  
14 However, the body is not one member, but many.  
15 If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it does not for that reason cease to be part of the body.  
16 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it does not for that reason cease to be part of the body.  
17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?  
18 But now God has arranged the members, each one of them, in the body just as He desired.  
19 And if they were all one member, where would the body be?  
20 But now there are many members, but one body.  
21 And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”  
22 On the contrary, those members of the body that seem to be weaker are much more necessary,  
23 and those parts of the body we think less honorable, we bestow with greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,  
24 whereas our presentable parts have no need. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked,  
25 that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.  
26 And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.


27 Now you are the body of Christ, and individually members of it.  
28 And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, and various kinds of tongues.  
29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all perform miracles?  
30 Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?  
31 But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I will show you an even more excellent way.  




Chapter 13


1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.  
2 And if I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to move mountains but yet I do not have love, I am nothing.  
3 And if I give away all my possessions and hand over my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing.


4 Love is patient; love is kind. It does not envy; it does not boast; it is not arrogant.  
5 It does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own; it is not easily provoked; it does not keep a record of wrongs.  
6 It does not rejoice in unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth.  
7 It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.


8 Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, one day they stop; if tongues, they will no longer exist; if knowledge, it will be brought to nothing.  
9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,  
10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away with.  
11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.  
12 For now we see through a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I also have been fully known.


13 So now these three remain: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.




Chapter 14


1 Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
2 For the one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he speaks mysteries in the Spirit.
3 On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, encouragement, and comfort.
4 The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.
5 Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edification.


6 But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what benefit will I be to you unless I speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by teaching?
7 Even lifeless things that produce sound, whether flute or harp, if they do not give a distinction in the notes, how will what is played on the flute or harp be recognized?
8 For if the trumpet gives an unclear sound, who will prepare himself for battle?
9 So also with you: unless you utter intelligible speech with the tongue, how will what is spoken be understood? You will be speaking into the air.
10 There are, doubtless, many kinds of languages in the world, and none is without meaning.
11 But if I do not understand the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.
12 So also you—since you are zealous for spiritual gifts—strive to abound in those that build up the church.


13 Therefore, let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful.
15 What is the result then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind. I will sing praise with the spirit, and I will also sing praise with the mind.
16 Otherwise, if you give thanks with the spirit only, how will the one who occupies the place of the uninformed say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?
17 For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other is not edified.
18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
19 Nevertheless, in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.


20 Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature.
21 In the Law it is written: “By men of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me,” says the Lord.
22 So then, tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers.
23 If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds?
24 But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all,
25 the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.


26 What then is the outcome, brothers? When you come together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.
27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, it must be by two or at most three, and each in turn, and let one interpret.
28 But if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God.
29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.
30 But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, let the first keep silent.
31 For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged.
32 And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.


33 For God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.
34 Let the women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, just as the Law also says.
35 If they want to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.
36 Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached?
37 If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.
38 But if anyone ignores this, he is to be ignored.


39 Therefore, brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
40 But let all things be done properly and in an orderly manner.




Chapter 15
***
1 Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I proclaimed to you, which you also received, in which you also stand,  
2 through which also you are being saved—if you hold firmly to the word I proclaimed to you—unless you believed in vain.  
3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,  
4 and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,  
5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.  
6 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.  
7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.  
8 Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.  
9 For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.  
10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. Instead, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that is with me.  
11 Whether then it was I or they, this is what we preached, and this is what you believed.


12 Now if Christ is being proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?  
13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.  
14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is empty, and your faith is also empty.  
15 Moreover, we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ—whom he did not raise if indeed the dead are not raised.  
16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.  
17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.  
18 Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.  
19 If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.


20 But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.  
21 For since through a man came death, through a man also came the resurrection of the dead.  
22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.  
23 But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ at his coming.  
24 Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power.  
25 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.  
26 The last enemy to be abolished is death.  
27 For “he has subjected all things under his feet.” But when it says, “all things are subjected,” it is clear that it excludes the one who subjected all things to him.  
28 And when all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to the one who subjected all things to him, so that God may be all in all.


29 Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are they even baptized for them?  
30 And why are we in danger every hour?  
31 I die daily—by my boasting in you, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.  
32 If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with human motives, what did it profit me? If the dead are not raised, “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”  
33 Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”  
34 Sober up as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God—I say this to your shame.


35 But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?”  
36 You fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.  
37 And what you sow, you do not sow the body that will be, but a bare kernel—perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.  
38 But God gives it a body just as he wills, and to each of the seeds its own body.  
39 All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind for men, another flesh for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.  
40 There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one kind, and the glory of the earthly is another.  
41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.  
42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.  
43 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.  
44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.  
45 So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.  
46 However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.  
47 The first man is from the earth, made of dust; the second man is from heaven.  
48 As is the man made of dust, so also are those made of dust; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are heavenly.  
49 And just as we have borne the image of the man made of dust, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly man.


50 Now I say this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.  
51 Behold, I tell you a mystery: we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed—  
52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  
53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  
54 But when this corruptible puts on incorruption, and this mortal puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will come to pass: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”  
55 “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?”  
56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.  
57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
58 Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.




Chapter 16


1 Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so also you are to do.  
2 On the first day of every week, let each man set aside something, saving up whatever he may prosper in, so that collections need not be made when I come.  
3 And when I arrive, I will send whomever you approve with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem.  
4 If it seems advisable that I also go, they will go with me.


5 But I will come to you after passing through Macedonia—for I am passing through Macedonia—  
6 and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I go.  
7 For I do not want to see you now only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.  
8 But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,  
9 for a wide and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.


10 Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he is doing the work of the Lord just as I am.  
11 Therefore let no man despise him. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.


12 Now concerning our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers, but it was not at all his desire to go now. He will go when he has the opportunity.


13 Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.  
14 Let all that you do be done in love.


15 Now I urge you, brothers—you know the household of Stephanas, that it was the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints—  
16 that you also be subject to such men and to every fellow worker and laborer.  
17 I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence.  
18 For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore recognize such men.


19 The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, together with the church that is in their house.  
20 All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.


21 This greeting is in my, Paul's, own hand.  
22 If any man does not love the Lord, let him be accursed. Maranatha!  
23 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.  
24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.﻿The Second Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians


Chapter 1


1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia:  
2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  


3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort,  
4 who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.  
5 For just as the sufferings of Christ abound for us, so also through Christ our comfort abounds.  
6 If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer.  
7 And our hope for you is firm, because we know that as you share in the sufferings, so also you will share in the comfort.  


8 For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life itself.  
9 Indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves, so that we would not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.  
10 He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. We have set our hope on him, that he will yet again deliver us,  
11 while you also help us by your prayers, so that thanks may be given by many on our behalf for the gracious gift bestowed on us through the prayers of many.  


12 For our boast is this: the testimony of our conscience, that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, with simplicity and godly sincerity—not by human wisdom but by the grace of God.  
13 For we are not writing you anything other than what you read and understand—and I hope you will understand fully,  
14 just as you have partially understood us—that we are your boast, just as you also are ours on the day of our Lord Jesus.  


15 Because I was confident of this, I intended to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace,  
16 and through you to pass on to Macedonia, and from Macedonia to come again to you, and by you to be sent on my way to Judea.  
17 Was I vacillating when I intended this? Or do I make my plans according to the flesh, saying "Yes, yes" and "No, no" at the same time?  
18 But as God is faithful, our word to you has not been "Yes and no."  
19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we preached among you—Silvanus, Timothy, and I—was not "Yes and no," but in him it has always been "Yes."  
20 For all the promises of God in him are "Yes." Therefore also through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.  
21 Now it is God who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us,  
22 and who has also sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.  


23 But I call God as witness against my soul—that it was to spare you that I did not come again to Corinth.  
24 Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in the faith.




Chapter 2


1 So I decided this for myself: that I would not come to you again in sorrow.  
2 For if I cause you sorrow, who then makes me glad but the one I made sorrowful?  
3 And I wrote this very thing so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice, having confidence in all of you that my joy is the joy of you all.  
4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears—not so that you would be grieved, but that you might know the love I have especially for you.


5 But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has not grieved me, but in part—so that I may not overstate it—all of you.  
6 This punishment by the majority is sufficient for such a man,  
7 so that now, on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest such a one be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.  
8 Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.  
9 For this is why I also wrote: to test you and to know whether you are obedient in everything.  
10 But the one whom you forgive, I also forgive; for indeed, what I have forgiven—if I have forgiven anything—I did it for your sake in the presence of Christ,  
11 so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.


12 Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was opened for me in the Lord,  
13 I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus. So I said farewell to them and went on to Macedonia.


14 But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of Him in every place.  
15 For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing—  
16 to the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?  
17 For we are not like many, peddling the word of God; but as from sincerity, and as from God, we speak in Christ before God.




Chapter 3


1 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some, letters of recommendation to you or from you?
2 You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by all men.
3 You show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
4 Such is the confidence we have through Christ before God.


5 Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,
6 who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.


7 But if the ministry of death, engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not gaze at Moses’ face because of its glory—though it was fading—
8 how will the ministry of the Spirit not be even more glorious?
9 For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory.
10 For indeed, what once had glory has now no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it.
11 For if what was fading came with glory, much more will what remains be in glory.


12 Therefore, since we have such a hope, we speak with great boldness,
13 and not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel might not gaze at what was to eventually fade away.


14 But their minds were hardened; for until this very day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read—it has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.
15 But to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.
16 But whenever a man turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.


17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
18 And we all, with unveiled faces, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, who is the Spirit.




Chapter 4


1 Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart.  
2 But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We do not walk in craftiness, nor do we falsify the word of God. Instead, by the open statement of the truth, we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.  
3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.  
4 In their case, the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.  
5 For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.  
6 For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” is the one who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.


7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay, so that the surpassing power may be of God and not from us.  
8 We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;  
9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.  
10 Always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.  
11 For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be revealed in our mortal flesh.  
12 So death is at work in us, but life in you.


13 Since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, “I believed, and so I spoke,” we also believe, and so we also speak,  
14 knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.  
15 For all these things are for your sake, so that the grace that extends to more and more men may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.


16 So we do not lose heart. Though our outer man is wasting away, our inner man is being renewed day by day.  
17 For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,  
18 as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are temporary, but the things that are unseen are eternal.




Chapter 5


1 For we know that if the earthly tent we dwell in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens.  
2 For indeed, in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling—  
3 if indeed, when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.  
4 For while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened—not that we want to be unclothed, but to be clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.  
5 Now the one who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the Spirit as a guarantee.


6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord—  
7 for we walk by faith, not by sight.  
8 We are confident, then, and would prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.  
9 Therefore we also make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to him.  
10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each man may receive what is due for what he has done in the flesh, whether good or evil.


11 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men. But we are made manifest to God, and I hope also made manifest in your consciences.  
12 We are not again commending ourselves to you, but giving you an opportunity to boast on our behalf, so that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance and not in heart.  
13 For if we were out of our minds, it was for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.  
14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we have concluded this: that one died for all, therefore all died.  
15 And he died for all, so that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who died and was raised for their sake.


16 Therefore, from now on we regard no man according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him in this way no longer.  
17 Therefore, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away—behold, the new has come.  
18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,  
19 that is, God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.  
20 Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ: be reconciled to God.  
21 He made him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.




Chapter 6


1 As fellow workers, we urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.  
2 For he says, “At an acceptable time I listened to you, and on a day of salvation I helped you.” Look, now is the acceptable time; look, now is the day of salvation.  
3 We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that our ministry may not be faulted,  
4 but in everything we commend ourselves as servants of God: in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,  
5 in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in sleepless nights, in times of hunger;  
6 in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love,  
7 in the word of truth, in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;  
8 through glory and dishonor, through slander and praise; regarded as deceivers and yet true,  
9 as unknown and yet well known, as dying and yet we live, as disciplined and yet not put to death,  
10 as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing everything.


11 We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians; our heart is wide open.  
12 You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections.  
13 Now, in return—I speak as to children—you also open your hearts wide.


14 Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership does righteousness have with lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?  
15 What harmony does Christ have with Belial (wickedness)? Or what part does a believer share with an unbeliever?  
16 What agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said:


“I will dwell among them and walk among them,
and I will be their God,
and they shall be my people.


17 Therefore,
‘Come out from among them,
and be separate,’ says the Lord,
‘and do not touch what is unclean;
and I will receive you,
18 and I will be a father to you,
and you shall be sons and daughters to me,
says the Lord Almighty.’”




Chapter 7


1 Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of flesh and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.


2 Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one.  
3 I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.  
4 Great is my confidence in you, great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort; I overflow with joy in all our affliction.


5 For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted in every way—conflicts on the outside, fears within.  
6 But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the arrival of Titus,  
7 and not only by his arrival but also by the comfort with which he was comforted among you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.


8 For even if I made you grieve with my letter, I do not regret it—though I did regret it, for I see that that letter grieved you, though only for a short time.  
9 Now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you were grieved to repentance. For you were grieved according to the will of God, so that you suffered no loss through us.  
10 For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, but worldly grief produces death.  
11 For see what earnestness this very thing—this godly grief—has produced in you, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! In everything you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.  
12 So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the one who did wrong, nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you before God.  
13 Therefore we have been comforted.


And in addition to our comfort, we rejoiced even more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.  
14 For if I have boasted anything to him about you, I was not put to shame. But just as everything we said to you was in truth, so also our boasting before Titus proved to be true.  
15 And his affection for you is even greater as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.  
16 I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you.




Chapter 8


1 We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia.
2 For in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.
3 For I bear witness that they gave according to their means, and beyond their means—of their own accord—
4 begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the ministry to the saints.
5 And they did this not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us by the will of God.


6 Accordingly, we urged Titus that, just as he had begun, so he should also complete among you this gracious work.
7 But as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us—see that you also excel in this act of grace.


8 I am not saying this as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love is genuine.
9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich.
10 And in this matter I give my judgment: this benefits you, who a year ago began not only to do this work but also to desire to do it.
11 So now complete the doing of it, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have.
12 For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to what he does not have.


13 For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened, but that as a matter of fairness,
14 your abundance at the present time should supply their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be equality.
15 As it is written, “He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.”


16 But thanks be to God, who put the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.
17 For he accepted our appeal; being himself very earnest, he is going to you of his own accord.
18 And we are sending with him the brother who is praised among all the churches for his work in the gospel.
19 And not only that, but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this act of grace that is being administered by us, for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will.
20 We take this precaution so that no one should blame us regarding this generous gift that we are administering.
21 For we aim at what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men.


22 And we are sending with them our brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but who is now even more earnest because of his great confidence in you.
23 As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for your benefit. And as for our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
24 So give proof before the churches of your love and of our boasting about you to these men.




Chapter 9


1 For it is unnecessary for me to write to you about the ministry to the saints,  
2 for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, saying that Achaia has been prepared since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them.  
3 But I have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you may not be empty in this case, so that, as I said, you may be prepared.  
4 Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to mention you—would be put to shame in this situation of confident boasting.  
5 So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers that they should go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand the generous gift you promised, so that it may be ready as a gift and not as something extorted.


6 Now this I say: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows generously will also reap generously.  
7 Each man should give just as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.  
8 And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in everything, at all times, having all that you need, you may abound in every good work.  
9 As it is written: “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.”  
10 Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and increase the harvest of your righteousness.  
11 You will be enriched in every way for all generosity, which through us produces thanksgiving to God.  
12 For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing with many thanksgivings to God.  
13 Through the proof of this ministry they glorify God because of the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and for the generosity of your sharing with them and with everyone.  
14 And in their prayers for you, they long for you because of the surpassing grace of God upon you.  
15 Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!




Chapter 10


1 Now I, Paul, appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when away.
2 I beg you that when I am present, I may not have to be bold with the confidence I count on when I intend to be daring against some who think we are walking according to the flesh.
3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh.
4 For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds.
5 We demolish arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and we take every thought captive to obey Christ.
6 And we are ready to punish every disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.


7 Look at what is obvious. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, let him remind himself that just as he belongs to Christ, so also do we.
8 For even if I boast a little too much about our authority—which the Lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down—I will not be ashamed.
9 I do not want to seem as though I am frightening you by my letters.
10 For they say, “His letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is of no account.”


11 Let such a man consider this: what we are in word by letters when absent, such we will be in deed when present.
12 For we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding.


13 We, however, will not boast beyond limits, but will boast only with regard to the area of influence God assigned to us, to reach even as far as you.
14 For we are not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach you. For we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ.
15 We do not boast beyond limit in the labors of others, but we have the hope that as your faith increases, our area of influence among you may be greatly enlarged,
16 so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without boasting about work already done in another man's area of influence.


17 Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.
18 For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.




Chapter 11


1 I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness—indeed, do bear with me!
2 For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy, for I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
3 But I fear that just as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts might be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.


4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit than the one you received, or a different gospel than the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough.
5 For I consider myself in no way inferior to these “super-apostles.”
6 Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way we have made this clear to you in all things.


7 Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?
8 I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.
9 And when I was with you and in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way.
10 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.
11 Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!


12 But what I am doing I will continue to do, in order to cut off the opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in what they boast about.
13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
15 So it is no great surprise if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will be according to their deeds.


16 I repeat, let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, then accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.
17 What I am saying in this boastful confidence, I am not speaking as the Lord would, but as a fool.
18 Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.
19 For you gladly bear with fools, since you are so wise yourselves!
20 For you bear it if someone enslaves you, devours you, takes advantage of you, exalts himself, or strikes you in the face.


21 To my shame, I must say that we were too weak for that! But whatever anyone else dares to boast of—I am speaking foolishly—I also dare to boast of that.
22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
23 Are they servants of Christ? I am speaking like a madman—I am more so: with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, countless beatings, and often near death.


24 Five times I received from the Jews forty lashes minus one.
25 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea.
26 On frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own countrymen, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers;
27 in labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure.


28 And besides all this, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches.
29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?


30 If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
32 In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to arrest me,
33 but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.




Chapter 12


1 I must go on boasting—though it is not beneficial, I will now come to visions and revelations from the Lord.  
2 I know a man in Christ who, fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows—was caught up to the third heaven.  
3 And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows—  
4 was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak.  
5 On behalf of such a man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.  
6 For if I should wish to boast, I would not be foolish, for I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so that no one may think more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me,  
7 even because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations. Therefore, in order that I might not become conceited, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to torment me, so that I might not be conceited.  
8 I pleaded with the Lord three times about this, that it might leave me.  
9 But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore I will most gladly boast all the more in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.  
10 For this reason I am content with weaknesses, with insults, with hardships, with persecutions and difficulties, for the sake of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.


11 I have become foolish—you forced me to it. For I ought to have been commended by you, since I am in no way inferior to the super-apostles, even though I am nothing.  
12 The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance—signs and wonders and mighty works.  
13 For in what were you inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!


14 Look, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden, for I do not seek what is yours, but you. For children ought not to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.  
15 And I will most gladly spend and be completely spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?  
16 But let it be granted that I did not burden you—still, being crafty, I took you in by deceit!  
17 Did I take advantage of you through any of those I sent to you?  
18 I urged Titus to go, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit, in the same steps?


19 Have you been thinking all this time that we are defending ourselves to you? Before God we are speaking in Christ, and all for your upbuilding, beloved.  
20 For I fear that perhaps when I come I may not find you as I wish, and that I may be found by you not as you wish; that perhaps there may be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, disorder.  
21 I fear that when I come again, my God may humble me before you, and I may mourn over many who previously sinned and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and debauchery that they have practiced.




Chapter 13


1. This is the third time I am coming to you. "Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."
2. I warned those who sinned before and all the others, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that if I come again I will not spare them,
3. since you seek proof that Christ is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you but is powerful among you.
4. For he was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of God.


5. Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test!
6. I hope you will find out that we have not failed the test.


7. But we pray to God that you may do no wrong—not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem to have failed.
8. For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
9. For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. Your restoration is what we pray for.
10. For this reason I write these things while I am away from you, that when I come I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.


11. Finally, brothers, rejoice. Aim for restoration, comfort one another, agree with one another, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.


12. Greet one another with a holy kiss.


13. All the saints greet you.


14. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.﻿The Epistle of Paul to the Galatians


Chapter 1


1 Paul, an apostle—not sent from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—  
2 and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:


3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,  
4 who gave himself for our sins in order to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,  
5 to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.


6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—  
7 not that there is another gospel, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.  
8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim a gospel to you contrary to the one we proclaimed to you, let him be accursed.  
9 As we have said before, so now I say again: if anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be accursed.


10 For am I now seeking the approval of men or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.


11 For I make known to you, brothers, that the gospel proclaimed by me is not according to man.  
12 For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.


13 For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I was persecuting the church of God beyond measure and trying to destroy it.  
14 And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation, being far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.  
15 But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace, was pleased  
16 to reveal his Son in me so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,  
17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.


18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him for fifteen days.  
19 And I saw none of the other apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.  
20 (In what I am writing to you, behold, before God, I am not lying.)  
21 Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.  
22 I was still personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.  
23 They only kept hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.”  
24 And they glorified God because of me.




Chapter 2


1 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.  
2 I went up because of a revelation and laid out before them the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles—but privately to those of repute—lest I should be running, or had run, in vain.  
3 But even Titus, who was with me, though he is a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised.  
4 Yet because of the false brothers secretly brought in—who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us—  
5 we did not yield in submission to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.  
6 But from those who were considered to be something—what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality—those men added nothing to me.  
7 On the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised—  
8 for the one who worked through Peter for his apostleship to the circumcised also worked through me for the Gentiles—  
9 and recognizing the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.  
10 They only asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do.


11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.  
12 For before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those from the circumcision.  
13 And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.  
14 But when I saw that they were not walking uprightly in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, “If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?”


15 We are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners,  
16 yet we know that a man is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. Even we have believed in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no man will be justified.  
17 But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also have been found sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not!  
18 For if I rebuild the very things I tore down, I demonstrate myself to be a transgressor.  
19 For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God.  
20 I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.  
21 I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for nothing.




Chapter 3


1 You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified.
2 I only want to learn this from you: did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?
3 Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?
4 Have you suffered so much for nothing—if indeed it was for nothing?
5 So then, does the one who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?


6 Just as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness,
7 you must understand, then, that those who are of faith—these are the sons of Abraham.
8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the gospel in advance to Abraham: “In you shall all the nations be blessed.”
9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.


10 For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things written in the book of the law, to do them.”
11 Now it is evident that no man is justified before God by the law, because “The righteous shall live by faith.”
12 But the law is not of faith; rather, “The one who does them shall live by them.”
13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”—
14 so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.


15 Brothers, I speak according to human terms: even with a man-made covenant, once it has been ratified, no one cancels or adds to it.
16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. It does not say, “and to seeds,” as of many, but as of one: “and to your seed,” who is Christ.
17 What I am saying is this: the law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not nullify a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void.
18 For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God granted it to Abraham through a promise.


19 Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise had been made; and it was administered through angels by the hand of a mediator.
20 Now a mediator is not for one party only, but God is one.
21 Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been by the law.
22 But the Scripture confined all under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.


23 But before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed.
24 So then, the law was our guardian until Christ, so that we might be justified by faith.
25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,
26 for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
29 And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.




Chapter 4


1 I say that as long as the heir is a child, he differs in no way from a slave, though he is master of all.  
2 But he is under guardians and stewards until the time set by the father.  
3 So also we, when we were children, were enslaved under the elemental principles of the world.  
4 But when the fullness of time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,  
5 to redeem those under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.  
6 And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!”  
7 So then, you are no longer a slave but a son; and if a son, then also an heir through God.


8 However, formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those who by nature are not gods.  
9 But now that you have come to know God—or rather, to be known by God—how is it that you are turning back again to the weak and worthless elemental principles, to which you want to be enslaved all over again?  
10 You observe days and months and seasons and years.  
11 I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.


12 I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong.  
13 You know that it was because of a weakness of the flesh that I preached the gospel to you the first time.  
14 And though my flesh was a trial to you, you did not despise or reject me, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.  
15 What then became of your blessedness? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.  
16 So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?


17 They are zealous for you, but not for good. Rather, they want to shut you out, so that you might be zealous for them.  
18 Now it is good to be zealous for good at all times—not only when I am present with you—  
19 my children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you.  
20 I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.


21 Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?  
22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and one by the free woman.  
23 But the one by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, while the one by the free woman was through promise.  
24 These things are spoken allegorically: for these women are two covenants—one from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.  
25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.  
26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.  
27 For it is written,


“Rejoice, O barren woman who does not bear;  
break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor;  
for the children of the desolate woman are more than of her who has a husband.”


28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.  
29 But just as at that time the one born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.  
30 But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.”  
31 So then, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman.




Chapter 5


1 Christ has set us free so we could have freedom; stand firm, then, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.


2 Listen! I, Paul, tell you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.  
3 I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to keep the entire law.  
4 You who seek to be justified by the law have been cut off from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.  
5 For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly await the hope of righteousness.  
6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but only faith working through love.


7 You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?  
8 This persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.  
9 A little leaven leavens the whole batch.  
10 I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view; but the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he may be.  
11 But as for me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.  
12 I wish those who are unsettling you would go so far as to emasculate themselves!


13 For you were called to freedom, brothers; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love.  
14 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”  
15 But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.


16 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.  
17 For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. These are opposed to each other, so that you do not do whatever you want.  
18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.


19 Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery,  
20 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissension, factions,  
21 envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.


22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,  
23 gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.  
24 Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.


25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit.  
26 Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.




Chapter 6


1 Brothers, even if a man is caught in some transgression, you who are spiritual should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, watching yourself lest you too be tempted.  
2 Bear one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.  
3 For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.  
4 But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself alone and not in comparison to someone else.  
5 For each man will bear his own load.  


6 Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches.  
7 Do not be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, is what he will also reap.  
8 For the one who sows to his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.  
9 And let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not give up.  
10 So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, and especially to those of the household of the faith.  


11 See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.  
12 Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh are the ones compelling you to be circumcised—only so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.  
13 For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.  
14 But may it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.  
15 For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but a new creation.  
16 And as many as walk by this rule—peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.  


17 From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.  
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.﻿The Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians


Chapter 1


1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus and faithful in Christ Jesus:


2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.


3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,
4 just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love.
5 He predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,
6 to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he has graciously given us in the Beloved One.


7 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of trespasses, according to the riches of his grace
8 which he lavished on us in all wisdom and understanding.
9 He made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in him
10 as a plan for the fullness of time, to bring together all things in Christ—things in heaven and things on earth.


11 In him we also were appointed, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will,
12 so that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of his glory.
13 In him you also, when you heard the word of truth—the gospel of your salvation—and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the possession, to the praise of his glory.


15 Because of this, I too, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
16 do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.
18 I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints,
19 and what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength.


20 He exercised this power in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,
21 far above every rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named—not only in this age but also in the one to come.
22 He put all things in subjection under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church,
23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.




Chapter 2


1 And you were dead in your transgressions and sins,  
2 in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the ruler of the power of the air—the spirit now at work in the sons of disobedience.  
3 Among them we all once lived in the desires of our flesh, carrying out the inclinations of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.  
4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,  
5 even when we were dead in transgressions, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—  
6 and raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,  
7 so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.  
8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves—it is the gift of God;  
9 not from works, so that no man may boast.  
10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we might walk in them.


11 Therefore remember that formerly you—the Gentiles in the flesh, called “uncircumcision” by those called “circumcision” (a circumcision made in the flesh by human hands)—  
12 were at that time without Christ, alienated from the citizenship of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.  
13 But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.  
14 For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups one and tore down the dividing wall of hostility,  
15 by abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments in ordinances, so that He might create in Himself one new man in place of the two, making peace,  
16 and might reconcile both to God in one body through the cross, by which He put the hostility to death.  
17 And He came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near;  
18 for through Him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.


19 So then, you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,  
20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone,  
21 in whom the whole building, being joined together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.  
22 In Him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.




Chapter 3


1 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles—
2 assuming you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you—
3 that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, just as I wrote above in brief.
4 When you read this, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ.
5 This mystery was not made known to the sons of men in previous generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets:
6 that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.


7 Of this gospel I became a servant according to the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by the working of His power.
8 To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given—to proclaim to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,
9 and to bring to light for all what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things,
10 so that now, through the church, the multifaceted wisdom of God might be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms.
11 This was according to the eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,
12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in Him.
13 Therefore I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.


14 For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.
16 I pray that, according to the riches of His glory, He would grant you to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in your inner being,
17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
18 may have strength to grasp, along with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
19 and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.


20 Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly than all we ask or think, according to the power at work within us,
21 to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.




Chapter 4


1 I, therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you were called,  
2 with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,  
3 making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.  
4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were also called in one hope of your calling—  
5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,  
6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.


7 But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.  
8 Therefore it says, “When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive and gave gifts to men.”  
9 (Now what does “He ascended” mean except that He also descended into the lower regions, the earth?  
10 He who descended is the same one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.)


11 And He Himself gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, some as pastors and teachers,  
12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ,  
13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,  
14 so that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human trickery, or craftiness in deceitful schemes.  
15 But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ—  
16 from whom the whole body, being joined and held together by every joint that supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for building itself up in love.


17 So I say this and testify in the Lord: you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their philosophies.  
18 They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to the hardness of their hearts.  
19 Having become callous, they have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.  
20 But that is not how you learned Christ—  
21 if indeed you heard Him and were taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus—
22 that you are to put off, with regard to your former way of life, the old man, which is being corrupted by the deceitful desires,  
23 and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,  
24 and to put on the new man, created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth.


25 Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.  
26 Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,  
27 and do not give the devil an opportunity.  
28 Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him work, performing useful labor with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with those in need.  
29 Let no corrupt word come out of your mouth, but only what is good for building up, as fits the occasion, so that it may give grace to those who hear.  
30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.  
31 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and shouting and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.  
32 Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also forgave you.




Chapter 5


1 Therefore, be imitators of God, as beloved children,  
2 and walk in love, just as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a pleasing aroma.


3 But sexual immorality and any kind of impurity or greed must not even be mentioned among you, as is proper for saints.  
4 Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or crude joking—which are out of place—but rather thanksgiving.  
5 For you can be sure of this: that no sexually immoral or impure man, or one who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.


6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.  
7 Therefore, do not be partners with them.  
8 For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light—  
9 for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth—  
10 trying to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.  
11 Do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them.  
12 For it is shameful even to speak of the things they do in secret.  
13 But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,  
14 for what makes everything visible is light. Therefore it says, “Awake, O sleeper, and rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”


15 Be very careful, then, how you walk—not foolishly, but wisely,  
16 making the most of the time, because the days are evil.  
17 Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.  
18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit,  
19 speaking to one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making music in your heart to the Lord,  
20 always giving thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
21 submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.


22 Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as to the Lord.  
23 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ also is the head of the church—He Himself being the Savior of the body.  
24 But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.


25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,  
26 to sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of water with the word,  
27 so that He might present the church to Himself in splendor, without stain or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and blameless.  
28 In the same way, husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.  
29 For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,  
30 because we are members of His body.
33 Nevertheless, each one of you must also love his own wife as himself, and the wife must respect her husband.




Chapter 6


1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
2 “Honor your father and mother”—this is the first commandment with a promise:
3 “so that it may go well with you and that you may live long on the earth.”
4 And fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.


5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with sincerity of heart, as you would Christ—
6 not only when they are watching, as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.
7 Serve with goodwill as to the Lord and not to men,
8 knowing that whatever good each one does, he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.


9 And masters, do the same to them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.


10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.
11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.
12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against authorities, against the worldly rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you may be able to resist when evil comes and, having done everything, to stand firm.


14 Stand, then, having fastened the belt of truth around your waist and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
15 and having fitted your feet with the readiness of the gospel of peace.
16 In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
17 And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
18 Pray in the Spirit at all times with every kind of prayer and petition. To this end, stay alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints.


19 And pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, a word may be given to me so that I will boldly make known the mystery of the gospel,
20 for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.


21 Now so that you also may know how I am doing and what I am up to, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will tell you everything.
22 I have sent him to you for this very reason, that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts.


23 Peace to the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
24 Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.﻿The Epistle of Paul to the Philippians


Chapter 1


1 Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, along with the elders and deacons:


2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.


3 I thank my God every time I remember you,
4 always in every prayer of mine for all of you, praying with joy,
5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.
6 And I am confident of this: that he who began a good work in you will complete it by the day of Christ Jesus.


7 It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart—both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all sharers with me in grace.
8 For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.


9 And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all discernment,
10 so that you may approve what is excellent, and be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,
11 filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.


12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually advanced the gospel.
13 As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for Christ.
14 And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.


15 Some, to be sure, preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.
16 The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel;
17 the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking they will stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.
18 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed—and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,
19 for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.


20 It is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be ashamed in anything, but that with full courage, now as always, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
21 For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
22 But if I live in the flesh, this means fruitful labor for me—yet I do not know which I prefer.
23 I am torn between the two: I have the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.
24 But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
25 Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you, for your progress and joy in the faith,
26 so that your pride in Christ Jesus may overflow on account of me through my coming to you again.


27 Only live in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you—that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,
28 and not frightened of anything by your opponents. This is a sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation—and this is from God.
29 For it has been granted to you for the sake of Christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake,
30 since you are experiencing the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.




Chapter 2


1 So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any fellowship in the Spirit, any affection and compassion,  
2 then make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, being united in spirit and intent on one purpose.  
3 Do nothing from selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility regard one another as more important than yourselves.  
4 Let each of you look, not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.


5 Let this mindset be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,  
6 who, though He existed in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be exploited,  
7 but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.  
8 And being found in human form, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death—even death on a cross.  
9 Therefore God highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name,  
10 so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow—in heaven and on earth and under the earth—  
11 and that every tongue would confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.


12 So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence but now much more in my absence—work out your salvation with fear and trembling.  
13 For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.


14 Do all things without grumbling or arguing,  
15 so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,  
16 holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may have reason to boast that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.  
17 But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with all of you.  
18 Likewise, you also should rejoice and share your joy with me.


19 I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.  
20 For I have no one else like him, who will genuinely care about your welfare.  
21 For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.  
22 But you know his proven character, that as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.  
23 Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.  
24 And I trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon also.


25 But I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus—my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my needs.  
26 For he has been longing for all of you and was distressed because you heard that he was sick.  
27 Indeed he was sick, nearly to the point of death. But God had mercy on him—and not only on him but also on me, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.  
28 Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again, you may rejoice and I may be less anxious.  
29 So welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor such men,  
30 because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for what was lacking in your service to me.




Chapter 3


1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you again is not burdensome for me, and it is a safeguard for you.


2 Watch out for the dogs, watch out for the evil workers, watch out for those who mutilate the flesh.
3 For we are the true circumcision—those who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh—
4 although I myself have grounds for confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more:
5 circumcised on the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;
6 as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, faultless.


7 But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
8 More than that, I consider all things loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus as my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and consider them garbage, in order that I may gain Christ
9 and be found in him—not having a righteousness of my own from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith.
10 I want to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,
11 so that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.


12 Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfected, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus also took hold of me.
13 Brothers, I do not consider myself to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: forgetting what is behind and reaching forward to what is ahead,
14 I press on toward the goal, to win the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.


15 Let all of us who are mature think this way. And if in anything you think differently, God will reveal that to you as well.
16 Only let us hold fast to what we have already attained.


17 Join in imitating me, brothers, and keep your eyes on those who live according to the example you have in us.
18 For many—whom I have often told you about and now tell you even with tears—live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
19 Their end is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on earthly things.
20 But our citizenship is in heaven, and from there we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
21 who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him to subject all things to himself.




Chapter 4


1 So then, my beloved and longed-for brothers, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends.


2 I urge Euodia and Syntyche to agree in the Lord.  
3 Yes, I also ask you, true companion, help these women who contended alongside me in the gospel, together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.


4 Rejoice in the Lord always; I will say it again: rejoice!  
5 Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near.  
6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.  
7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.


8 Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable—if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—think about these things.  
9 What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.


10 I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that now at last your concern for me has revived. Indeed, you were concerned, but you lacked the opportunity to show it.  
11 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content in whatever situation I am in.  
12 I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In every circumstance and in all things, I have learned the secret of being well-fed and going hungry, of having abundance and suffering need.  
13 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.


14 Still, you did well to share in my affliction.  
15 You yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church partnered with me in giving and receiving except you alone.  
16 Even in Thessalonica you sent gifts more than once for my needs.  
17 Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the profit that increases to your account.  
18 I have received everything in full, and more. I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you sent—a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.  
19 And my God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.  
20 To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.


21 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.  
22 All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar’s household.  
23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.﻿The Epistle of Paul to the Colossians


Chapter 1


1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
2 to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ in Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.


3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
4 since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints,
5 because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. You heard about this hope beforehand in the word of truth, the gospel,
6 which has come to you, just as it is bearing fruit and increasing in all the world, just as it does among you, from the day you heard and truly understood the grace of God.


7 You learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf
8 and has made known to us your love in the Spirit.


9 For this reason, from the day we heard, we have not ceased praying for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
10 so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him: bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God,
11 being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might, for all endurance and patience, with joy,
12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.


13 He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of the Son He loves,
14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.


15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
16 For by Him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through Him and for Him.


17 He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
18 He is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself might come to have first place in everything.
19 For in Him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell,
20 and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace through the blood of His cross.


21 And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,
22 He has now reconciled in His body of flesh through death, in order to present you holy and blameless and beyond reproach before Him—
23 if, indeed, you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister.


24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and I am filling up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ for the sake of His body, that is, the church,
25 of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known—
26 the mystery that was hidden for ages and generations but now has been revealed to His saints.


27 To them God chose to make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.


28 We proclaim Him, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, so that we may present every man mature in Christ.
29 For this I toil, struggling with all His energy that works powerfully within me.




Chapter 2


1 For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for all who have not seen me face to face,  
2 so that their hearts may be encouraged, being united in love and reaching all the wealth of complete understanding, to know the mystery of God—namely, Christ,  
3 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
4 I say this so that no one may deceive you with persuasive speech.  
5 For although I am absent in the body, I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your orderly conduct and the firmness of your faith in Christ.


6 Therefore, just as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, continue to walk in Him,  
7 being rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.  
8 See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental principles of the world, and not according to Christ.  
9 For in Him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,  
10 and you have been made complete in Him, who is the head over every ruler and authority.  
11 In Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not done by hands, but by putting off the body of flesh in the circumcision of Christ,  
12 having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.


13 And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our trespasses.  
14 He wiped out the record of debt against us with its legal demands, which was hostile to us. He took it away by nailing it to the cross.
15 He disarmed the rulers and authorities and publicly disgraced them, triumphing over them in it [the cross].


16 Therefore, do not let anyone judge you in regard to food or drink or in regard to a festival or a new moon or Holiday Sabbaths.  
17 These are a shadow of things to come, but the reality belongs to Christ.  
18 Let no one disqualify you, insisting on self-abasement and the worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without cause by his fleshly mind,  
19 and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its joints and ligaments, grows with the growth that comes from God.


20 If you died with Christ to the elemental principles of the world, why, as though you were still living in the world, do you submit to its regulations—  
21 “Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch”?  
22 All these refer to things that perish with use; they are based on merely human commands and teachings.  
23 These have an appearance of wisdom with self-imposed religion, false humility, and harsh treatment of the body, but they are of no value in restraining the indulgence of the flesh.




Chapter 3


1 So if you’ve been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
2 Set your mind on things above, not on earthly things.
3 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
4 When Christ—your life—appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.


5 Put to death, then, whatever is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry.
6 Because of these things, the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.
7 You once walked in these things when you were living in them.
8 But now you must rid yourselves of all things like anger, rage, malice, slander, and obscene speech from your mouth.
9 Do not lie to one another, since you’ve taken off the old man with his practices
10 and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of his Creator.
11 Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free, but Christ is all and in all.


12 Therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and dearly loved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,
13 bearing with one another and forgiving each other if anyone has a complaint against someone. Just as the Lord forgave you, so also you must forgive.
14 And above all these things, put on love, which binds everything together in perfect unity.


15 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful.
16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.
17 And whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.


18 Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
19 Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
20 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
21 Fathers, do not provoke your children, so they don’t become discouraged.


22 Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything—not with external service as those trying to please men, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.
23 Whatever you do, work at it wholeheartedly, as for the Lord and not for men,
24 knowing that you will receive the inheritance as your reward from the Lord. Serve Christ the Lord.
25 For the one who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.




Chapter 4


1 Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven.


2 Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.
3 At the same time, pray also for us, that God would open a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ—for which I am in chains—
4 so that I may make it clear, as I ought to speak.


5 Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity.
6 Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.


7 Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a beloved brother, a faithful servant, and fellow slave in the Lord.
8 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know our situation and that he may encourage your hearts.
9 He is coming with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that has happened here.


10 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you have received instructions—if he comes to you, welcome him),
11 and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only ones of the circumcision who are fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.


12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you. He is always striving in prayer on your behalf, that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.
13 For I testify about him that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.


14 Luke, the beloved physician, greets you, as does Demas.
15 Greet the brothers in Laodicea, and Nympha and the church that meets in her house.
16 And when this letter has been read among you, make sure it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the letter from Laodicea.


17 And say to Archippus, “Pay attention to the ministry that you have received in the Lord, so that you may fulfill it.”


18 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.﻿The First Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians


Chapter 1


1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: grace to you and peace.


2 We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers,  
3 remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father.  
4 For we know, brothers beloved by God, your election,  
5 because our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction—just as you know what sort of men we proved to be among you for your sake.


6 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with the joy of the Holy Spirit,  
7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.  
8 For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we have no need to say anything.  
9 For they themselves report about us what sort of reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God,  
10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.




Chapter 2


1 For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not in vain.
2 But after we had already suffered and been shamefully treated in Philippi, as you know, we had boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much conflict.


3 For our exhortation did not come from error or impurity or by way of deceit;
4 rather, just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak—not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts.
5 For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed—God is our witness—
6 nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though we could have made demands as apostles of Christ.


7 But we became gentle in your midst, as a nursing mother cherishes her own children.
8 So, having deep affection for you, we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us.
9 For you remember, brothers, our labor and hardship: working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.


10 You are witnesses, and God also, how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we behaved toward you who believe—
11 just as you know how, like a father with his own children,
12 we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.


13 And because of this, we also constantly thank God, that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it truly is—the word of God, which also is at work in you who believe.


14 For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews,
15 who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and are not pleasing to God, and are hostile to all men,
16 hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved—so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.


17 But we, brothers, having been torn away from you for a short time—in person, not in heart—were all the more eager with great desire to see your face.
18 For we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, more than once—and Satan hindered us.
19 For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not indeed you?
20 For you are our glory and joy.




Chapter 3


1 So when we could no longer endure it, we thought it best to be left behind in Athens alone,
2 and we sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in regard to your faith,
3 so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed for this,
4 for indeed, when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction, just as it happened—and you know it did.
5 For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our labor might be in vain.


6 But now Timothy has just come to us from you and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always remember us kindly and long to see us—just as we also long to see you.
7 Because of this, brothers, we were comforted in you through your faith in all our distress and affliction.
8 For now we live, if you are standing firm in the Lord.
9 For what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God because of you?
10 Night and day we keep praying most earnestly to see your face and to complete what is lacking in your faith.


11 Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you,
12 and may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow in love for one another and for all men, just as we also do for you,
13 so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.




Chapter 4


1 For the rest, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, just as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God—just as you are doing—that you do so more and more.  
2 For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.  
3 For this is the will of God: your sanctification—that you abstain from sexual immorality,  
4 that each man among you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor,  
5 not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God.  
6 No man should transgress and take advantage of his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, just as we told you before and solemnly warned you.  
7 For God has not called us to impurity but to holiness.  
8 Therefore, the one who rejects this is not rejecting man but God, who gives His Holy Spirit to you.


9 Now concerning brotherly love, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.  
10 Indeed, you are doing this toward all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to excel even more  
11 and to aspire to live quietly, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, just as we instructed you,  
12 so that you may walk properly before outsiders and not be dependent on anyone.


13 But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, so that you may not grieve like the rest who have no hope.  
14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep.  
15 For this we say to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.  
16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.  
17 Then we who are alive, who remain, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.  
18 Therefore, comfort one another with these words.




Chapter 5


1 Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need for anything to be written to you.  
2 For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.  
3 When they say, “Peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.  
4 But you, brothers, are not in darkness, so that the day should surprise you like a thief.  
5 For you are all sons of light and sons of day; we are not of night nor of darkness.  
6 So then, let us not sleep as the rest do, but let us be alert and sober.  
7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.  
8 But since we are of the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.  
9 For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,  
10 who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we might live together with Him.  
11 Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.


12 Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and who are over you in the Lord and admonish you,  
13 and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.  
14 And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone.  
15 See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all.


16 Rejoice always,  
17 pray without ceasing,  
18 give thanks in everything; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.  
19 Do not quench the Spirit.  
20 Do not despise prophecies,  
21 but test all things; hold fast to what is good.  
22 Abstain from every form of evil.


23 Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
24 The one who calls you is faithful, and He will surely do it.


25 Brothers, pray for us.  
26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.  
27 I charge you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.  
28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.﻿The Second Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians


Chapter 1


1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2 Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.


3 We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, just as it is fitting, because your faith is growing abundantly and the love of each one of you for one another is increasing.
4 As a result, we ourselves boast about you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions you are enduring.
5 This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering.
6 For it is just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,
7 and to grant relief to you who are afflicted, along with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
8 inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
9 These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his strength,
10 when he comes to be glorified among his saints and to be marveled at among all who have believed—because our testimony to you was believed—on that day.


11 To this end also we pray for you always, that our God would make you worthy of the calling and fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power,
12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.




Chapter 2


1 Now we ask you, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,
2 that you not be quickly shaken in mind or troubled, either by a spirit or by a message or by a letter seeming to come from us, as though the day of the Lord has already come.
3 Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,
4 who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he sits in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.


5 Do you not remember that, while I was still with you, I used to tell you these things?
6 And you know what is restraining him now, so that he will be revealed in his own time.
7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains it will do so until he is taken out of the way.
8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of His coming.
9 The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power and false signs and wonders,
10 and with every wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved.
11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie,
12 in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness.


13 But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits for salvation, through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.
14 To this He called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
15 So then, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by our letter.


16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
17 comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word.




Chapter 3


1 Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run swiftly and be glorified, just as it was among you,  
2 and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men; for not all have faith.  
3 But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.  
4 And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we command.  
5 May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ.


6 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who lives irresponsibly and not according to the tradition that you received from us.  
7 For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we did not act irresponsibly among you,  
8 nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but with labor and toil we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you.  
9 It was not because we do not have the right, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate.  
10 For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: if anyone is not willing to work, do not allow him to eat.
11 For we hear that some among you are living irresponsibly, not working at all but meddling in the affairs of others.
12 Now such men we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they work quietly and eat their own bread.


13 But you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.
14 And if anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that man and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.
15 Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.


16 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with you all.


17 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.﻿The First Epistle of Paul to Timothy


Chapter 1


1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus, who is our hope,
2 To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 


3 As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine
4 nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith.


5 The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
6 Certain persons, by swerving from these, have wandered away into vain discussion,
7 desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions. 


8 Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully,
9 understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers,
10 the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine,
11 in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted. 


12 I thank Him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, because He judged me faithful, appointing me to His service,
13 though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief,
14 and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.


15 The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.
16 But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display His perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in Him for eternal life.


17 To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.


18 This charge I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare,
19 holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith,
20 among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme.




Chapter 2


1 I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,
2 for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.
3 This is good, and pleases God our Savior,
4 who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
6 who gave Himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time.
7 And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.


8 Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing.
9 I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,
10 but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.


11 A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.
12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.
13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
14 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.
15 But women will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with propriety.




Chapter 3


1 This saying is trustworthy: if a man aspires to the office of elder, he desires a noble work.
2 Therefore, the elder must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
3 not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.
4 He must manage his own household well, keeping his children submissive with all dignity
5 (for if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God?).
6 He must not be a recent convert, lest, being puffed up with pride, he fall into the judgment of the devil.
7 Moreover, he must have a good reputation with those outside, so that he may not fall into disgrace and the snare of the devil.


8 Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain.
9 They must hold to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
10 And these also must be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach.


11 Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things.
12 Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well.
13 For those who serve well as deacons gain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.


14 I am writing these things to you, though I hope to come to you soon,
15 but if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.


16 And undeniably great is the mystery of godliness:
He was manifested in the flesh,
vindicated by the Spirit,
seen by angels,
proclaimed among the nations,
believed on in the world,
taken up in glory.




Chapter 4


1 Now the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,
2 through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences have been seared.
3 They forbid marriage and require abstaining from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.


4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
5 for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.


6 If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being nourished on the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.
7 But reject profane and old wives’ tales, and train yourself for godliness.
8 For bodily training is of some value, but godliness is valuable in every way, having promise for the present life and also for the life to come.
9 This saying is trustworthy and worthy of full acceptance.
10 For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.


11 Command and teach these things.


12 Let no one look down on your youth, but be an example to the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.
13 Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.
14 Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders.
15 Practice these things; be in them, so that your progress may be evident to all.
16 Pay close attention to yourself and to the teaching. Persevere in them, for by doing so you will save both yourself and those who hear you.




Chapter 5


1 Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but appeal to him as a father, younger men as brothers,
2 older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity.


3 Honor widows who are truly widows.
4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to practice piety in regard to their own household and to repay their parents, for this is acceptable before God.
5 Now she who is truly a widow and left all alone has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.
6 But she who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.
7 Command these things as well, so that they may be above reproach.
8 But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.


9 Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years old, the wife of one man,
10 having a reputation for good works, if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has helped those in distress, if she has devoted herself to every good work.


11 But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when their passions draw them away from Christ, they desire to marry,
12 and so incur judgment because they have set aside their former pledge.
13 And at the same time they also learn to be idle, going around from house to house — and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they should not say.
14 Therefore I want younger widows to marry, to bear children, to manage their households, and to give the adversary no occasion for reproach.
15 For some have already turned aside to follow Satan.
16 If any believing woman has widows in her family, let her assist them, and let the church not be burdened, so that it may assist those who are truly widows.


17 Let the elders who lead well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.
18 For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is threshing,” and, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”
19 Do not accept an accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
20 Those who continue in sin rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also may fear.
21 I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels to observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing out of partiality.


22 Do not lay hands hastily on anyone, nor share in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.
23 No longer drink only water, but use a little grape juice for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.


24 The sins of some men are obvious, going before them into judgment, but those of others follow after.
25 In the same way also, good works are obvious, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden.




Chapter 6


1 Let all who are under the yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be blasphemed.
2 And those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers; rather, they must serve them all the more, because those who benefit from their service are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.


3 If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words—those of our Lord Jesus Christ—and with the teaching that accords with godliness,
4 he is conceited and understands nothing, but has a sick craving for controversies and disputes about words, from which come envy, strife, slander, evil suspicions,
5 constant friction among men corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.


6 But godliness with contentment is great gain,
7 for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of it.
8 But if we have food and clothing, we should be content with them.
9 But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a trap and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into ruin and destruction.
10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, through which some, by craving it, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains.


11 But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.
12 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
13 I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,
14 to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
15 which he will display at the proper time—he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
16 who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.


17 Command those who are rich in the present age not to be arrogant, nor to put their hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
18 They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,
19 storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of what is truly life.


20 O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the irreverent chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge,
21 which some have professed and thus gone astray from the faith.
Grace be with you.﻿The Second Epistle of Paul to Timothy


Chapter 1


1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,
2 To Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.


3 I give thanks to God, whom I serve with a pure conscience as my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,
4 longing to see you, remembering your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.
5 I am reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in you also.


6 For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands.
7 For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and love and self-control.


8 Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,
9 who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
10 but now has been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel,
11 for which I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.


12 For this reason I also suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard what has been entrusted to me until that day.


13 Hold to the pattern of sound words that you heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
14 Guard the good deposit entrusted to you through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.


15 You know this, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains,
17 but when he was in Rome, he eagerly sought me out and found me.
18 May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day. And you know very well how much he served in Ephesus.  




Chapter 2


1 You, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
2 And what you have heard from me through many witnesses, entrust these things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.


3 Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
4 No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, so that he may please the one who enlisted him.


5 And if someone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.


6 It is the hardworking farmer who ought to receive first a share of the crops.


7 Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.
8 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, from the seed of David, according to my gospel,
9 for which I am suffering, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained.
10 For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.


11 The saying is trustworthy:  
If we died with Him, we shall also live with Him.
12 If we endure, we shall also reign with Him;  
if we deny Him, He also will deny us.
13 If we are faithless, He remains faithful—  
for He cannot deny Himself.


14 Remind them of these things, solemnly charging them before God not to dispute about words, which is of no benefit and leads to the ruin of the hearers.
15 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.
16 But avoid profane and empty chatter, for it will lead to more ungodliness,
17 and their message will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
18 who have strayed from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they are upsetting the faith of some.


19 Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.”


20 Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, and some for honor and some for dishonor.
21 Therefore, if a man cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared for every good work.


22 Flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
23 But refuse foolish and ignorant controversies, knowing that they breed quarrels.


24 And a servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome, but must be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient when wronged,
25 correcting with gentleness those who oppose him—if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,
26 and they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, after being held captive by him to do his will.




Chapter 3


1 But understand this: that in the last days perilous times will come.
2 For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, slanderers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,
3 unfeeling, unyielding, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of good,
4 treacherous, reckless, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Avoid such men as these.


6 For from among them are those who creep into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led along by various desires,
7 always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.


8 And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these kinds of men oppose the truth—men corrupted in mind, disqualified regarding the faith.
9 But they will not progress further, for their folly will be evident to all, as was that of those two men.


10 But you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,
11 persecutions, sufferings—what befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all of them the Lord delivered me.
12 Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
13 But evil men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.


14 But you, remain in the things you have learned and were assured of, knowing from whom you learned them,
15 and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith that is in Christ Jesus.


16 For all Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,
17 that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.  




Chapter 4


1 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom:
2 Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all patience and instruction.  
3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound teaching, but according to their own desires, they will accumulate for themselves teachers, having itching ears,
4 and they will turn away their ears from the truth and be turned aside to myths.  


5 But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.
7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
8 Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved His appearing.  


9 Make every effort to come to me soon,  
10 for Demas, having loved this present age, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
11 Luke alone is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry.
12 But I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
13 When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.


14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
15 You also should beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words.
16 At my first defense no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. May it not be counted against them.
17 But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear. And I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth.
18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and will save me for His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.


19 Greet Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.
20 Erastus remained in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.
21 Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers.  


22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.﻿The Epistle of Paul to Titus


Chapter 1


1 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of the elect of God and the knowledge of the truth that accords with godliness,
2 in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages began,
3 and at the proper time manifested in His word through the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the command of God our Savior,
4 to Titus, a true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.


5 For this reason I left you in Crete, that you might set in order what remained and appoint elders in every city as I directed you:
6 if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of dissipation or insubordination.
7 For the overseer must be blameless as a steward of God, not arrogant, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for gain,
8 but hospitable, loving what is good, self-controlled, righteous, holy, disciplined,
9 holding firmly to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able both to encourage with sound teaching and to refute those who contradict.


10 For there are many rebellious men, idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision.
11 It is necessary to silence them, since they are upsetting whole households by teaching what they ought not for the sake of dishonest gain.
12 One of them, their own prophet, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”
13 This testimony is true. For this reason, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,
14 not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.


15 To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; instead, both their mind and conscience are defiled.
16 They profess to know God, but they deny Him by their works. They are detestable and disobedient and unfit for any good work.




Chapter 2


1 But you, speak what is fitting for sound instruction.
2 Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, in endurance.
3 Likewise, older women are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,
4 so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands and children,
5 to be self-controlled, pure, managing a household, kind, submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed.


6 Likewise, urge the young men to be self-controlled in all things,
7 showing yourself as a model of good works, in teaching with integrity, dignity,
8 sound speech that is beyond reproach, so that the opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.


9 Slaves are to be submissive to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not contradicting them,
10 not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in everything.


11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
12 instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live sensibly, righteously, and godly in the present age,
13 waiting for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,
14 who gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good works.


15 Speak these things, and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.




Chapter 3


1 Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
2 to speak evil of no man, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all courtesy toward all men.
3 For we ourselves also were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.


4 But when the kindness and the love for man of God our Savior appeared,
5 He saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done but according to His mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
6 whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
7 so that having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.


8 The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are good and profitable for men.


9 But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and quarrels about the Law, for they are unprofitable and worthless.
10 A man who is divisive, after a first and second warning, have nothing more to do with him,
11 knowing that such a man is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.
12 When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.


13 Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way, so that they lack nothing.
14 And let our men learn to devote themselves to good works to meet pressing needs, so that they may not be unfruitful.


15 All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.﻿Philemon


Chapter 1


1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker,
2 and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house:
3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.


4 I give thanks to my God always when I remember you in my prayers,
5 because I hear of your love and the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
6 so that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.
7 For I have had much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.


8 Therefore, though I have much boldness in Christ to command you to do what is proper,
9 yet for love’s sake I appeal to you—being such a one as Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—
10 I appeal to you concerning my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,
11 who formerly was useless to you but now is useful both to you and to me.
12 I am sending him back to you, that is, my very heart,
13 whom I wanted to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might serve me in my imprisonment for the gospel.


14 But without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness might not be by compulsion but by free will.
15 For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a time, so that you might have him back forever,
16 no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.


17 If, then, you consider me a partner, receive him as you would me.
18 And if he has wronged you in anything or owes you anything, charge that to my account.


19 I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it. Not to mention that you owe me your very self besides.
20 Yes, brother, may I have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.


21 Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
22 And at the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.


23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
24 as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.


25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.﻿Hebrews


Chapter 1


1 In many places and in many ways, God spoke long ago to the fathers by the prophets,
2 but in these last days He has spoken to us by a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the universe.


3 He is the radiance of His glory and the exact imprint of His nature, and He upholds all things by the word of His power. After making purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
4 having become as much superior to the angels as the name He has inherited is more excellent than theirs.


5 For to which of the angels did He ever say,  
“You are My Son; today I have begotten You”?  
And again,  
“I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son”?


6 And again, when He brings the Firstborn into the world, He says,  
“Let all the angels of God worship Him.”


7 And regarding the angels He says,  
“He makes His angels winds,  
and His ministers a flame of fire.”


8 But of the Son He says,  
“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,  
and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.
9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;  
therefore God, Your God, has anointed You  
with the oil of gladness beyond Your companions.”


10 And,  
“You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning,  
and the heavens are the works of Your hands;
11 they will perish, but You remain;  
they will all wear out like a garment;
12 like a robe You will roll them up,  
like a garment they will be changed.  
But You are the same,  
and Your years will never end.”


13 But to which of the angels has He ever said,  
“Sit at My right hand  
until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet”?


14 Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are about to inherit salvation?




Chapter 2


1 Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.
2 For if the word spoken through angels proved firm, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,
3 how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first was spoken through the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard,
4 God bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders and various miracles, and by distributions of the Holy Spirit according to His will?


5 For it was not to angels that He subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.
6 But someone has testified somewhere, saying,  
“What is man, that You remember him,  
or the son of man, that You care for him?
7 You made him lower than the angels for a little while;  
You crowned him with glory and honor;  
You put all things under his feet.”


8 For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.
9 But we see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.
10 For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings.


11 For both the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brothers,
12 saying,  
“I will declare Your name to My brothers;  
in the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.”


13 And again,
“I will put my trust in Him.”
And again,
“Behold, I and the children whom God has given Me.”


14 Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise partook of the same, so that through death He might destroy the one who has the power of death—that is, the devil—
15 and free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.


16 For surely it is not angels that He helps, but He helps the seed of Abraham.
17 Therefore He had to be made like His brothers in every respect, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.
18 For since He Himself suffered when tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted.




Chapter 3


1 Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,
2 who was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses also was faithful in all His house.
3 For this man has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
4 For every house is built by someone, but the One who built all things is God.
5 And Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken later,
6 but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if indeed we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm to the end.


7 Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,
“Today, if you hear His voice,
8 do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,
on the day of testing in the wilderness,
9 where your fathers tried Me by testing Me,
and saw My works for forty years.
10 Therefore I was angry with that generation,
and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart;
and they have not known My ways.’
11 As I swore in My wrath,
‘They shall not enter My rest.’”


12 Watch out, brothers, lest there be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God.
13 But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
14 For we have become partakers of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm to the end,
15 as it is said,
“Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”


16 For who were those who heard and rebelled? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt through Moses?
17 And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?
18 And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, except to those who were disobedient?
19 And so we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.




Chapter 4


1 Therefore, let us fear, so that while a promise remains of entering His rest, none of you may seem to have fallen short of it.
2 For indeed we have had the good news proclaimed to us just as they did; but the word they heard did not benefit them, because it was not united by faith with those who heard.
3 For we who have believed are entering that rest, just as He has said,
“As I swore in My wrath,
‘They shall not enter My rest,’”
although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.
4 For He has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.”
5 And again in this passage: “They shall not enter My rest.”
6 Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them failed to enter because of disobedience,
7 He again designates a certain day — “Today” — saying through David after so long a time, as has been said before,
“Today, if you hear His voice,
do not harden your hearts.”
8 For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken afterward about another day.
9 So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.


10 For the one who has entered His rest has also rested from his works, just as God did from His.
11 Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of disobedience.
12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.


13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are uncovered and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.
14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens — Jesus the Son of God — let us hold fast to our confession.
15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.
16 Therefore, let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for help in time of need.




Chapter 5


1 For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in matters pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
2 He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself is also beset with weakness,
3 and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins: both for the people, and also for himself.
4 And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when called by God, just as Aaron also was.


5 So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become high priest, but the One who said to Him, “You are My Son, today I have begotten You”;
6 just as He also says in another place, “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”


7 In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverence.
8 Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from what He suffered.
9 And having been perfected, He became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him,
10 being designated by God as high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.


11 Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.
12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.
13 For everyone who partakes only of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.
14 But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to distinguish between good and evil.


Chapter 6


1 Therefore, leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,
2 of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.
3 And this we will do, if God permits.
4 For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,
5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,
6 and then have fallen away, to renew them again to repentance, since they are crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and holding Him up to contempt.


7 For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and produces vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated receives a blessing from God;
8 but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned.
9 But we are convinced of better things concerning you, beloved, things that belong to salvation, even though we speak in this way.


10 For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love you have shown toward His name, having ministered and still ministering to the saints.
11 And we desire each one of you to demonstrate the same diligence toward the full assurance of hope until the end,
12 so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
13 For when God made a promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,
14 saying, “Surely I will bless you and multiply you.”
15 And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.


16 For men swear by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath serves as confirmation and puts an end to every dispute.
17 In the same way, God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable nature of His purpose, guaranteed it with an oath,
18 so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us.
19 This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast and entering within the veil,
20 where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.




Chapter 7


1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
2 and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace.
3 He is without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.


4 Now consider how great this man was: even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils.
5 And those from the sons of Levi who receive the priestly office have a command according to the Law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham.
6 But this man, who did not trace his lineage from them, received tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
7 Now without any dispute, the lesser is blessed by the greater.
8 And in one case, mortal men receive tithes, but in the other, they are received by one of whom it is testified that he lives.
9 And, so to speak, Levi too, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,
10 for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.


11 Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood—for under it the people received the Law—what further need would there have been for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, rather than one designated according to the order of Aaron?
12 For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the Law as well.
13 For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has served at the altar.
14 For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe about which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
15 And this is even more clear if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,
16 who has become such not according to a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.
17 For it is testified: “You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.”


18 For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness
19 (for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.


20 And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made so without an oath,
21 but this One was made a priest with an oath, by the One who said to Him,
“The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind: ‘You are a priest forever.’”
22 In this way Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.


23 Also, the former priests were many in number because they were prevented by death from continuing in office,
24 but He holds His priesthood permanently, because He continues forever.
25 Therefore He is able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him, since He lives without dying in order to be able to intercede for them.


26 For such a high priest was indeed fitting for us—holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.
27 He does not need, as those high priests do, to offer sacrifices daily, first for His own sins and then for those of the people, since this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.
28 For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.




Chapter 8


1 Now the main point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
2 a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent, which the Lord pitched, not man.


3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this one also to have something to offer.
4 Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law,
5 which gifts serve as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned when he was about to construct the tabernacle. For He said, “See that you make everything according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain.”


6 But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, since He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.


7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.
8 For finding fault with them, He says:
“Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord,
when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel
and with the house of Judah,
9 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers
on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.
For they did not continue in My covenant,
and I disregarded them, says the Lord.
10 For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel
after those days, says the Lord:
I will put My laws into their minds
and I will write them upon their hearts.
And I will be their God,
and they shall be My people.
11 And they shall not teach each one his fellow citizen
and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’
for they shall all know Me,
from the least of them to the greatest.
12 For I will be merciful toward their wrongdoings,
and their sins I will remember no more.”


13 In speaking of a new covenant, He has made the first obsolete; and what is becoming obsolete and growing old is about to disappear.




Chapter 9


1 Now indeed even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.
2 For a tent was prepared, the first room in which were the lampstand and the table and the presentation of the bread; it is called the Holy Place.
3 And after the second curtain was a tent called the Most Holy Place,
4 having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which were a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.
5 And above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. But of these things we cannot now speak in detail.


6 Now with these things thus prepared, the priests continually enter the first room, performing their regular duties.
7 But into the second only the high priest enters, once a year, and not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people.
8 By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the Most Holy Place is not yet revealed while the first tent is still standing.
9 This is a symbol for the present time, according to which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,
10 but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation.


11 But Christ, having come as high priest of the good things that have come, through the greater and more perfect tent that was not made with hands (that is, the one that is not of this creation),
12 has entered once for all into the Most Holy Place, not by means of the blood of goats and calves, but by means of his own blood, thus securing eternal redemption.
13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are defiled, cleanse for the purification of the flesh,
14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?


15 And for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has occurred for redemption from the transgressions committed under the first covenant, those who are called might receive the promised eternal inheritance.
16 For where there is a will, it is necessary to establish the death of the one who made it.
17 For a will is valid only when someone has died, since it is never in force while the one who made it is still alive.
18 Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood.
19 For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
20 saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you.”
21 And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship.
22 Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.


23 Therefore since it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be purified with such things, the heavenly things themselves had to be purified with better sacrifices than the former things.
24 For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.
25 Nor does he offer himself again and again, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place year by year with blood that is not his own,
26 for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
27 And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment,
28 so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to save those who eagerly await him.




Chapter 10


1 For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come and not the original image of those things, can never, by the same sacrifices that they continually offer year by year, make those who draw near to be perfect.
2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?
3 But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.


4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
5 Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says, “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You prepared for Me;
6 in burnt offerings and offerings for sin You took no pleasure.
7 Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come— in the scroll of the book it is written of Me— to do Your will, O God.’”


8 After saying the above, “Sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and offerings for sin You did not desire nor took pleasure in them” (which are offered according to the law),
9 then He said, “Behold, I have come to do Your will.” He takes away the first in order to establish the second.
10 By this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.


11 And every priest stands day after day ministering and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
12 But this One, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God,
13 waiting from then on until His enemies are made a footstool for His feet.
14 For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.


15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
16 “This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws on their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,”
17 He also adds, “Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.”
18 Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.


19 Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence for the entrance into the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,
20 by the new and living way which He opened for us through the curtain—that is, His flesh—
21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.
24 And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,
25 not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.


26 For if we sin deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
27 but a fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that is about to consume the adversaries.
28 Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
29 How much worse punishment do you think one will deserve who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has regarded as profane the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
30 For we know the One who said, “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge His people.”
31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.


32 But remember the former days in which, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings—
33 partly being publicly exposed both to insults and afflictions, and partly becoming sharers with those who were treated in this way.
34 For you sympathized with those in prison and accepted with joy the seizure of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves have a better and abiding possession.
35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has great reward.
36 For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised.


37 “For yet a little while, the Coming One will come and will not delay;
38 but My righteous one shall live by faith, and if he draws back, My soul has no pleasure in him.”


39 But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preservation of the soul.




Chapter 11


1 Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.  
2 For by it the men of old received commendation.  
3 By faith we understand that the universe was formed by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.  


4 By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he was attested as righteous, God bearing witness to his gifts; and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.  
5 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him; for before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God.  


6 Now without faith it is impossible to please Him, for whoever approaches God must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek Him.  
7 By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, with reverent fear prepared an ark for the salvation of his household; by this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.  


8 By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.  
9 By faith he dwelled in the land of promise as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise.  
10 For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.  


11 By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even though she was past the proper age, since she regarded Him faithful who had promised.  
12 Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven and as countless as the sand on the seashore.  


13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.  
14 For those who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.  
15 If they had been thinking of the land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.  
16 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.  


17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac; and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son,  
18 to whom it had been said, “Through Isaac your descendants shall be named.”  
19 He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.  


20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.  
21 By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and bowed in worship over the head of his staff.  
22 By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions concerning his bones.  


23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.  
24 By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,  
25 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin.  
26 He considered the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.  


27 By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger, for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.  
28 By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them.  


29 By faith they crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were swallowed up.  


30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.  
31 By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had welcomed the spies in peace.  


32 And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, and Samuel and the prophets—  
33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,  
34 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.  


35 Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing release so that they might gain a better resurrection.  
36 Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.  
37 They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword; they went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, afflicted, mistreated—  
38 of whom the world was not worthy—wandering in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.  


39 And all these, though they were commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised,  
40 because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.




Chapter 12


1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,  
2 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the founder and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.  


3 Consider Him who endured from sinners such hostility against Himself, so that you may not grow weary or lose heart.  


4 In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.  
5 And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons:  
“My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,  
nor grow weary when you are reproved by Him;  
6 for the Lord disciplines the one He loves,  
and chastises every son whom He receives.”  


7 It is for discipline that you endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?  
8 But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.  
9 Furthermore, we had earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?  
10 For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our benefit, that we may share in His holiness.  
11 All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful but painful; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.  


12 Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble,  
13 and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.  


14 Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord.  
15 See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God, and that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;  
16 that no one is sexually immoral or profane like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.  
17 For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no opportunity for repentance, though he sought it with tears.  


18 For you have not come to what may be touched, to a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and whirlwind,  
19 and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made those who heard it beg that no further message be spoken to them,  
20 for they could not bear what was commanded: “If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.”  
21 Indeed, the sight was so terrifying that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.”  


22 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels in festive assembly,  
23 and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect,  
24 and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.  


25 See that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused Him who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we turn away from Him who warns from heaven.  
26 His voice then shook the earth, but now He has promised, saying, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.”  
27 Now this phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain.  


28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe.  
29 For our God is a consuming fire.




Chapter 13


1 Let brotherly love continue.
2 Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing so some have entertained angels without knowing it.
3 Remember those in prison, as though you were in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you yourselves are in the body.


4 Let marriage be honored among all, and the marriage bed undefiled; for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.


5 Keep your life free from the love of money, and be content with what you have, for He has said, “I will never leave you, nor will I forsake you.”
6 So we say with confidence, “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear; what can man do to me?”


7 Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.
8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
9 Do not be led away by various and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, which have not benefited those devoted to them.


10 We have an altar from which those who serve in the tent have no right to eat.
11 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.
12 So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through His own blood.
13 Therefore let us go to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.
14 For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come.


15 Through Him, therefore, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that confess His name.
16 Do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.


17 Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account, so that they may do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no benefit to you.


18 Pray for us, for we are convinced that we have a clear conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.
19 I urge you all the more to do this, so that I may be restored to you sooner.


20 Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus—the great Shepherd of the sheep—by the blood of the everlasting covenant,
21 equip you with every good thing to do His will, working in us what is pleasing before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.


22 I appeal to you, brothers, bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.
23 Know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you.
24 Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.
25 Grace be with you all.﻿James


Chapter 1


1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: greetings.


2 Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials,
3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
4 And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.


5 But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him.
6 But let him ask in faith, without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.
7 For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord—
8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.


9 Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,
10 and the rich man in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away.
11 For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.


12 Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.
13 Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” for God is not tempted by evil, and He Himself tempts no one.
14 But each one is tempted when he is dragged away and enticed by his own desire.
15 Then desire, when it has conceived, gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death.


16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.
18 Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.


19 Know this, my beloved brothers: let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger,
20 for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
21 Therefore, put away all filthiness and the overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.


22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror.
24 For he looks at himself and goes away and immediately forgets what he was like.
25 But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and continues in it—not being a forgetful hearer but a doer who acts—he will be blessed in his doing.


26 If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this man’s religion is worthless.
27 Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.




Chapter 2


1 My brothers, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality.
2 For if a man enters your assembly with a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also enters,
3 and you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or “Sit down at my footstool,”
4 have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?


5 Listen, my beloved brothers: has not God chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that He has promised to those who love Him?
6 But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you and drag you into court?
7 Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?


8 If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.
9 But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.
11 For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.


12 So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.
13 For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.


14 What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
15 If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food,
16 and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things needed for the body, what good is that?
17 So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.


18 But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
19 You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!
20 Do you want to be shown, you foolish man, that faith apart from works is useless?


21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
22 You see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made complete.
23 And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness,” and he was called a friend of God.
24 You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.


25 And in the same way was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
26 For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.




Chapter 3


1 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.
2 For we all stumble in many ways. If a man does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body.
3 Now if we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well.
4 Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
5 So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.


See how great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!
6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the course of life, and it is set on fire in hell.
7 For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind,
8 but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
9 With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men who are made in the likeness of God.
10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.
11 Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?
12 Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt spring yield fresh water.


13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his works are done in the gentleness of wisdom.
14 But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.
15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every evil practice.
17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.
18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.




Chapter 4


1 What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?
2 You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and wage war. You do not have, because you do not ask.
3 You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.
4 You adulterous men, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
5 Or do you suppose that the Scripture says in vain, “He yearns jealously over the spirit that He has made to dwell in us”?
6 But He gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”


7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
8 Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
9 Be miserable and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.


11 Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
12 There is one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?


13 Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that city and spend a year there and trade and make a profit”—
14 yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
15 Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.”
16 But as it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.
17 So for the man who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.


Chapter 5


1 Come now, you rich, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you.
2 Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten.
3 Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasure in the last days.
4 Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.
5 You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
6 You have condemned and murdered the righteous man; he does not resist you.


7 Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early and late rain.
8 You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
9 Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.
10 As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
11 Behold, we consider those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord—how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.


12 But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath. Let your “yes” be yes and your “no” be no, so that you may not fall under judgment.


13 Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.
14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
15 And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man has great power as it is working.
17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
18 Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.


19 My brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back,
20 let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.The First Epistle of Peter

Chapter 1

1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen sojourners scattered througout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling with the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace and peace be multiplied to you.

3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
4 to an inheritance imperishable and undefiled and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
5 who by God’s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the time of the end.

6 In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials,
7 so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes, though tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
8 Though you have not seen Him, you love Him; and though you do not now see Him, yet believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,
9 receiving the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

10 Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours sought and inquired carefully,
11 inquiring into what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when He testified beforehand to the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these.
12 It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look.

13 Therefore, gird up the loins of your mind, be sober-minded, and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
14 As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former desires in your ignorance,
15 but as He who called you is holy, you also, be holy in all your conduct,
16 because it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.”

17 And if you call on Him as Father who judges impartially according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves with fear during the time of your sojourning,
18 knowing that you were ransomed from your futile way of life handed down from your forefathers, though not with perishable things such as silver or gold,
19 but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish and without spot.
20 He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in the last times for your sake,
21 who through Him believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.

22 Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart,
23 having been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God;
24 for,
“All flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of grass.
The grass withers, and the flower falls,
25 but the word of the Lord endures forever.”
And this is the word that was preached to you.


Chapter 2

1 So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.
2 Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation—
3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.

4 As you come to Him, a living stone rejected by men but chosen and honored by God,
5 you also, like living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
6 For it says in Scripture:
“Behold, I am laying in Zion a cornerstone, chosen and precious,
and whoever believes in Him shall not be put to shame.”
7 So the honor is for you who believe,
but for those who do not believe,
“The stone that the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone,”
8 and,
“A stone of stumbling,
and a rock of offense.”
They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.

9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.
10 Once you were not a people,
but now you are God’s people;
once you had not received mercy,
but now you have received mercy.

11 Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against the soul.
12 Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.

13 Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as supreme,
14 or to governors as those sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.
15 For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should silence the ignorance of foolish men.
16 Live as free men, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but as servants of God.
17 Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.

18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.
19 For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.
20 For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God.

21 For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in His steps.
22 He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in His mouth.
23 When He was reviled, He did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but continued entrusting Himself to Him who judges justly.
24 He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By His wounds you were healed.
25 For you were going astray like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.


Chapter 3

1 Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives,
2 when they see your respectful and pure conduct.
3 Do not let your adornment be external—as in the braiding of hair, wearing of gold, or putting on of fine clothing—
4 but let it be the hidden man of the heart, with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is very precious.
5 For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves,
by being subject to their own husbands,
6 just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.

7 Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.

8 Finally, all of you, be like-minded, sympathetic, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, and humble.
9 Do not repay evil for evil or insult for insult, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may inherit a blessing.
10 For,
“Whoever desires to love life and see good days,
let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit;
11 let him turn away from evil and do good;
let him seek peace and pursue it.
12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
and His ears are open to their prayer.
But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”

13 Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?
14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “Do not fear what they fear, nor be troubled,”
15 but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect,
16 having a good conscience, so that when you are slandered, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame.
17 For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will than for doing evil.

18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit,
19 in which also He went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,
20 because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few—that is, eight persons—were brought safely through water.
21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you—not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to Him.


Chapter 4

1 Therefore, since Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose—because the one who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin—
2 so as to live the rest of his time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
3 For the time that has passed is sufficient to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and lawless idolatries.

4 In this they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excess of recklessness, and they slander you;
5 but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.

6 For this is why the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead, so that though judged in the flesh as men, they might live in the spirit according to God.
7 But the end of all things is near; therefore be sound-minded and sober for the sake of prayers.

8 Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.
9 Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.

10 Just as each has received a gift, use it to serve one another as good stewards of the varied grace of God:
11 if anyone speaks, as one speaking the oracles of God; if anyone serves, as from the strength which God supplies, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ—to whom belong the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.

12 Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial among you, which comes upon you for testing, as though something strange were happening to you,
13 but to the extent you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that at the revelation of His glory you may also rejoice with exultation.
14 If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.

15 Let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler.
16 But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.

17 For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
18 And if the righteous person is saved with difficulty, what will become of the ungodly person and the sinner?

19 Therefore let those also who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.


Chapter 5

1 Therefore I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a sharer in the glory that is to be revealed:
2 shepherd the flock of God among you, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God desires; not for shameful gain, but eagerly;
3 not as lording it over those allotted to you, but as becoming examples to the flock.
4 And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.

5 Likewise, you younger men, be subject to the elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”
6 Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you at the proper time,
7 casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.

8 Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
9 Resist him, being firm in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being experienced by your brothers throughout the world.
10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
11 To Him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.

12 Through Silvanus, a faithful brother as I consider him, I have written briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it.
13 She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you, and so does Mark, my son.
14 Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ.

The Second Epistle of Peter

Chapter 1

1 Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
2 Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.

3 His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence,
4 by which He has granted to us precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world through lust.

5 And for this very reason, applying all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge,
6 and to knowledge self-control, and to self-control perseverance, and to perseverance godliness,
7 and to godliness brotherly affection, and to brotherly affection love.
8 For if these things are yours and increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
9 For whoever lacks these things is blind, being nearsighted, having forgotten the cleansing from his former sins.

10 Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these things you will never stumble.
11 For in this way entrance will be richly supplied to you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

12 Therefore I intend always to remind you of these things, even though you know them and are established in the truth that is present with you.
13 I consider it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by way of reminder,
14 knowing that the removal of my tent is soon, just as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
15 And I will also make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.

16 For we did not follow cleverly crafted myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
17 For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, a voice was borne to Him by the Majestic Glory, “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
18 We ourselves heard this voice borne from heaven, for we were with Him on the holy mountain.

19 And we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,
20 knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from one's own interpretation.
21 For no prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.


Chapter 2

1 But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.
2 And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of the truth will be blasphemed.
3 And in greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction will not be delayed.

4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into the Pit and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until judgment;
5 and if He did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, along with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
6 and if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes He condemned them to ruin, having made them an example of what is coming to the ungodly;
7 and if He rescued righteous Lot, who was distressed by the sensual conduct of the lawless
8 (for that righteous man, dwelling among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard),
9 then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,
10 and especially those who go after the flesh in defiling lust and who despise authority, being bold and arrogant, not afraid to slander glorious beings.

11 Whereas angels, though greater in strength and power, do not bring a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord.
12 But these, like irrational animals, born as creatures of instinct to be captured and destroyed, slandering what they do not understand, will also be destroyed in their destruction,
13 suffering harm as the wage of unrighteousness. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions while they feast with you.

14 They have eyes full of adultery, unceasing in sin, enticing unstable souls. They have hearts trained in greed, children of a curse.
15 Forsaking the straight path, they have gone astray. They have followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wage of unrighteousness,
16 but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a mute donkey speaking with a human voice restrained the prophet’s madness.

17 These are wells without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved.
18 For speaking arrogant words of vanity, they entice by sensual desires of the flesh those who are barely escaping from those who live in error.
19 Promising them freedom, they themselves are slaves of corruption. For by what a man is overcome, to that he is enslaved.

20 For if after having escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
21 For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
22 What has happened to them confirms the true proverb: “A dog returns to its own vomit,” and, “A washed sow returns to wallowing in the mud.”


Chapter 3

1 This is now the second letter I am writing to you, beloved. In both of them I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder,
2 that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles.

3 Knowing this first: that in the last days mockers will come with mocking, following after their own lusts
4 and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the forefathers fell asleep, all things continue just as they were from the beginning of creation.”
5 For they deliberately overlook this: that long ago by the word of God the heavens existed, and the earth was formed out of water and through water.
6 By these means the world of that time was destroyed, being flooded with water.
7 But the present heavens and earth are reserved by the same word for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.

8 But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved: that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
9 The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.
10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements will be dissolved with burning heat, and the earth and the works done on it will be exposed.

11 Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,
12 looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the elements will melt with burning heat?
13 But according to His promise, we are looking for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.

14 Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless.
15 And consider the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him,
16 as he does in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.

17 You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, guard yourselves so that you are not carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your own steadfastness.
18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
The First Epistle of John

Chapter 1

1 What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and our hands have touched—concerning the Word of life—
2 and the life was revealed, and we have seen and testify and declare to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was revealed to us—
3 what we have seen and heard we declare to you also, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
4 And we write these things so that our joy may be complete.

5 And this is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you: that God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.
6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.
7 But if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.

8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.


Chapter 2

1 My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ the righteous.
2 And He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.

3 And by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments.
4 Whoever says, “I have come to know Him,” and does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
5 But whoever keeps His word, truly in him the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him.
6 Whoever says he abides in Him ought also to walk in the same way in which He walked.

7 Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard.
8 Again, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.
9 Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness.
10 Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling.
11 But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you, for His name’s sake.
13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known Him, who is from the beginning.
I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.
I have written to you, children, because you have known the Father.
14 I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him, who is from the beginning.
I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.

15 Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
16 For all that is in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world.
17 And the world is passing away, along with its desire, but the one who does the will of God abides forever.

18 Children, it is the last hour, and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. From this we know that it is the last hour.
19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been with us, they would have remained with us. But they went out so that it might be made clear that none of them are with us.

20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, as you all know.
21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because do you know it, and because there is no lie with the truth.
22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist: the one who denies the Father and the Son.
23 Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son also has the Father.

24 As for you, let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.
25 And this is the promise that He Himself made to us: eternal life.

26 I have written these things to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you.
27 And as for you, the anointing that you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as His anointing teaches you about all things—and is true and not a lie, and just as it has taught you—you abide in Him.

28 And now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He appears we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming.
29 If you know that He is righteous, you also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of Him.


Chapter 3

1 See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should not only be called children of God, but really be such. Because of this the world does not know us, since it did not know Him.
2 Beloved, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that when He is revealed, we will be like Him, because we will see Him as He is.
3 And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.

4 Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, because sin is breaking the law.
5 And you know that He was revealed in order to take away sins, and in Him there is no sin.
6 Everyone who abides in Him does not keep on sinning; while everyone who keeps on sinning has not seen or known Him.

7 Little children, let no one deceive you. The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.
8 The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. And it is for the purpose of destroying the works of the devil that the Son of God was revealed.
9 No one who has been born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.
10 By this the children of God and the children of the devil are differentiated: everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, and neither is the one who does not love his brother.

11 For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another—
12 not as Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his deeds were evil and his brother’s were righteous.

13 So, brothers, do not be surprised, if the world hates you.
14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. Whoever does not love abides in death.
15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.

16 By this we know love, that He laid down His life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
17 But whoever has the world’s goods and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him—how does the love of God abide in him?

18 Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue but in action and truth.
19 By this we will know that we are of the truth and will assure our heart before Him,
20 that if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.
21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God;
22 and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight.

23 And this is His commandment: that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as He commanded us.
24 And the one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us: by the Spirit whom He gave us.


Chapter 4

1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. And this is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming, and now is already in the world.

4 You are from God, little children, and you have overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.
5 They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them.
6 We are from God. The one who knows God listens to us; the one who is not from God does not listen to us. From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.

7 Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
8 The one who does not love has not known God, because God is love.
9 By this the love of God was revealed among us, that God sent His only Son into the world, so that we might live through Him.
10 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins.

11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
12 No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.
13 By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us from His Spirit.
14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.

15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God.
16 And we have come to know and have believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.

17 By this love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because as He is, so also are we in this world.
18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears has not been perfected in love.
19 We love, because He first loved us.
20 If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar. For the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.
21 And this commandment we have from Him: that the one who loves God must also love his brother.


Chapter 5

1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one who has been born of Him.
2 By this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep His commandments.
3 For this is the love of God: that we keep His commandments—and His commandments are not burdensome.
4 For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith.
5 Who is the one who overcomes the world, except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?

6 This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ—not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
7 For there are three that testify:
8 the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are in agreement.

9 If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God, that He has testified concerning His Son.
10 The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. The one who does not believe God, has made Him into a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning His Son.
11 And this is the testimony: that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
12 The one who has the Son has life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have life.

13 I wrote these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.
14 And this is the confidence that we have before Him: that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
15 And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we will receive what we have asked from Him.

16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life—to those committing sin not leading to death. There is sin leading to death; I do not say that he should ask about that.
17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not leading to death.

18 We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but the one who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.
19 We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true One, and we are in the true One, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.

21 Little children, guard yourselves from idols.

The Second Epistle of John

Chapter 1

1 The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and not I alone, but also all who know the truth—
2 because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:
3 Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

4 I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we received the commandment from the Father.
5 And now I ask you, lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another.
6 And this is love: that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.

7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
8 Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may receive a full reward.
9 Everyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God. The one who abides in the teaching—this one has both the Father and the Son.
10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house and do not greet him.
11 For the one who greets him shares in his evil works.

12 Though I have much to write to you, I do not want to do so with parchment and ink, but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
13 The children of your elect sister greet you.

The Third Epistle of John

Chapter 1

1 The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.

2 Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.
3 For I rejoiced greatly when brothers came and testified to your truth, just as you are walking in the truth.
4 I have no greater joy than this: to hear that my children are walking in the truth.

5 Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you do for the brothers, even though they are strangers.
6 They have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God,
7 because they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.
8 Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers for the truth.

9 I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept us.
10 Because of this, if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, slandering us with wicked words. And not being satisfied with that, he not only refuses to welcome the brothers himself but also hinders those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.

11 Beloved, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. The one who does good is from God; the one who does evil has not seen God.
12 Demetrius has been well spoken of by everyone, and by the truth itself. And we also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true.

13 I had many things to write to you, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink.
14 But I hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face.

15 Peace to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.

Jude

Chapter 1

1 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:
2 May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.

3 Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith that was once and for all time delivered to the saints.
4 For certain men have crept in unnoticed, those who long ago were designated for this condemnation—ungodly men who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

5 Now I want to remind you—though you know all things once for all—that Jesus, after saving a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.
6 And angels who did not keep their own domain but abandoned their proper dwelling, He has kept in eternal chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day.
7 Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, are held up as an example by suffering the punishment of eternal destruction.

8 In the same way, these also—relying on dreams—defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme glorious beings.
9 But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued over the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a judgment of slander against him, but said, “The Lord rebuke you!”
10 But these men blaspheme all that they do not understand, and what they do understand by instinct, like irrational animals, they are destroyed by these things.

11 Woe to them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, and abandoned themselves for gain to the error of Balaam, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.
12 These are the hidden reefs in your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear, shepherds feeding only themselves; waterless clouds carried along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, uprooted;
13 wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.

14 And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied about these men, saying, “Behold, the Lord came with unnumbered holy angels,
15 to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.”

16 These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own lusts. Their mouth speaks arrogant things, flattering others for advantage.

17 But you, beloved, remember the words spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
18 how they said to you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly lusts.”
19 These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the Spirit.

20 But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
21 keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
22 And have mercy on those who doubt,
23 and save others by snatching them out of the fire; and on others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh.

24 Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of His glory with great joy,
25 to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority before all time and now and forever. Amen.

The Revelation of John

Chapter 1

1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His servants the things that must soon take place. And He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John,
2 who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all that he saw.
3 Blessed is the one who reads aloud, and those who hear the words of the prophecy and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is near.

4 John, to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne,
5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood—
6 and He made us a royal priesthood to His God and Father—to Him be glory and power forever and ever. Amen.

7 Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him—even those who pierced Him—and all the tribes of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.
8 “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “the One who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”

9 I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
11 saying, “Write what you see on a scroll and send it to the seven churches—to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.”

12 Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and having turned I saw seven golden lampstands,
13 and in the midst of the lampstands was One like a son of man, clothed in a long robe and girded across His chest with a golden sash.
14 His head and His hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes were like a flame of fire.
15 His feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters.
16 And in His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and His face was like the sun shining in its full strength.

17 When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying, “Do not fear. I am the First and the Last,
18 and the Living One. I was dead, and yet, I am alive forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of the grave.
19 Therefore write what you have seen, what is now, and what is to take place after this.
20 The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in My right hand, and of the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.”


Chapter 2

1 To the angel of the church in Ephesus, write:
These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands:
2 I know your works, and your toil and your endurance, and that you cannot tolerate evil men. You have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false.
3 And you have endurance and have borne hardship for My name’s sake, and have not grown weary.
4 But I have this against you, that you have left your first love.
5 Therefore remember where you have fallen from, and repent and do the works you did at first. But if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
6 But this you have: that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who overcomes, I will grant to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.

8 And to the angel of the church in Smyrna, write:
These are the words of the First and the Last, who was dead and came to life:
9 I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich), and the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
10 Do not fear what you are about to suffer. For the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.
11 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death.

12 And to the angel of the church in Pergamum, write:
These are the words of Him who has the sharp two-edged sword:
13 I know where you dwell, where the throne of Satan is; and you are holding fast to My name and did not deny the faith in Me, even in the days of Antipas, My faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
14 But I have a few things against you: that you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel—to eat food sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality.
15 So also you have some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
16 Therefore repent. But if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will fight against them with the sword of My mouth.
17 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who overcomes, I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except the one who receives it.

18 And to the angel of the church in Thyatira, write:
These are the words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire and feet like burnished bronze:
19 I know your works, and your love and faith and service and endurance, and that your last works are greater than the first.
20 But I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and deceives My servants to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.
21 And I gave her time to repent, but she does not want to repent of her sexual immorality.
22 Behold, I will cast her onto a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works.
23 And I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am He who searches hearts and minds, and I will give to each of you according to your works.

24 But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they call them—I place no other burden on you.
25 Only hold fast what you have until I come.
26 And to the one who overcomes and keeps My works to the end, I will give authority over the nations—
27 and he will rule them with a rod of iron, as when clay pots are broken in pieces—as I also have received from My Father.
28 And I will give him the morning star.
29 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.


Chapter 3

1 And to the angel of the church in Sardis, write:
These are the words of Him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars:
I know your works—that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead.
2 Wake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which are about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of My God.
3 Therefore remember what you have received and heard, and keep it, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.
4 But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.
5 The one who overcomes will be clothed in white garments, and I will never erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.
6 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:
These are the words of the Holy One, the True One, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens:
8 I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one can shut, because you have a little strength, and yet you have kept My word and have not denied My name.
9 Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan—those who say they are Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet and know that I have loved you.
10 Because you have kept My word of perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.
11 I am coming quickly. Hold fast what you have, so that no one may take your crown.
12 The one who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will never go out from it again. And I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God—the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God—and My new name.
13 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

14 And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write:
These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:
15 I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were cold or hot.
16 So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spit you out of My mouth.
17 Because you say, “I am rich and have become wealthy and have need of nothing,” and you do not know that you are wretched and pitiable and poor and blind and naked,
18 I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may be rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed, and salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see.
19 As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline. Be zealous, therefore, and repent.
20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.
21 The one who overcomes, I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, just as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne.
22 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.


Chapter 4

1 After these things I looked, and behold, a door was standing open in heaven. And the first voice that I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.”
2 Immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One was seated on the throne.
3 And the One seated was in appearance like jasper and carnelian, and a rainbow was around the throne, appearing like an emerald.

4 Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads.
5 From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder. And before the throne were seven torches of fire burning, which are the seven spirits of God.
6 And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, like crystal.

In the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.
7 The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like an ox, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like an eagle in flight.
8 And the four living creatures, each of them having six wings, were full of eyes all around and within. And day and night they never cease to say:
“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,
who was, and is, and is to come.”

9 And whenever the living creatures give glory, and honor, and thanks to the One seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
10 the twenty-four elders fall down before the One seated on the throne, and worship Him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
11 “Worthy are You, our Lord and God,
to receive glory and honor and power,
for You created all things,
and by Your will they existed and were created.”


Chapter 5

1 Then I saw in the right hand of the One seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.
2 And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?”
3 And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.
4 And I began to weep greatly, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
5 But one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so that He can open the scroll and its seven seals.”

6 And I saw in the midst of the throne, and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders - a Lamb standing, as though slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
7 And He came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One seated on the throne.
8 And when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
9 And they sang a new song, saying,
“You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals,
for You were slain, and by Your blood You ransomed men for God
from every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
10 and You made them a kingdom and priests to our God,
and they shall reign on the earth.”

11 Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
12 saying with a loud voice,
“Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength
and honor and glory and blessing!”

13 And I heard every creature in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying,
“To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb
be blessing and honor and glory and dominion
forever and ever!”

14 And the four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped.


Chapter 6

1 Then I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Come!”
2 And I looked, and I saw a white horse, and the one sitting on it had a bow. And a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to continue to conquer.

3 And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!”
4 And another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one sitting on it to take peace from the earth, so that men would slay one another, and a great sword was given to him.

5 And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” And I looked, and I saw a black horse, and the one sitting on it had a balance scale in his hand.
6 And I heard something like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius—and do not harm the oil and the wine.”

7 And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!”
8 And I looked, and I saw a pale green horse, and the one sitting on it was named Death, and the Grave followed after him. And authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.

9 And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony they had maintained.
10 And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”
11 And a white robe was given to each of them, and they were told to rest a little while longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, those who were to be killed as they themselves had been.

12 And I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the moon became like blood.
13 And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a strong wind.
14 And the sky vanished like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
15 And the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
16 And they said to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,
17 for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”


Chapter 7

1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or against any tree.
2 And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God. And he called out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,
3 saying, “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.”
4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed—144,000—sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:

5 from the tribe of Judah, 12,000 were sealed,
from the tribe of Reuben, 12,000,
from the tribe of Gad, 12,000,
6 from the tribe of Asher, 12,000,
from the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000,
from the tribe of Manasseh, 12,000,
7 from the tribe of Simeon, 12,000,
from the tribe of Levi, 12,000,
from the tribe of Issachar, 12,000,
8 from the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000,
from the tribe of Joseph, 12,000,
from the tribe of Benjamin, 12,000 were sealed.

9 After these things I looked, and I saw a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and with palm branches in their hands.
10 And they cried out with a loud voice, saying,
“Salvation belongs to our God
who sits on the throne,
and to the Lamb!”

11 And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
12 saying,
“Amen!
Blessing and glory and wisdom
and thanksgiving and honor
and power and strength
be to our God forever and ever. Amen.”

13 Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, clothed in white robes, and where have they come from?”
14 And I said to him, “My lord, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
15 Therefore they are before the throne of God,
and they serve Him day and night in His temple;
and He who sits on the throne
will shelter them with His presence.

16 They shall hunger no more,
neither shall they thirst anymore;
the sun shall not strike them,
nor any scorching heat.
17 For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,
and He will guide them to springs of living water,
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”


Chapter 8

1 And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
2 And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
3 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to him so that he might offer it with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne.
4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.
5 Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it to the earth, and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.

6 And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.
7 And the first sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was thrown upon the earth. And a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.

8 And the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood.
9 And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.

10 And the third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.
11 The name of the star is called Wormwood. And a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they had been made bitter.

12 And the fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them was darkened and a third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.
13 Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in the middle of the sky, saying with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining trumpet blasts that the three angels are about to sound!”


Chapter 9

1 And the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth, and the key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.
2 And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up from the pit like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit.
3 Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given to them, like the power the scorpions of the earth have.
4 And they were told not to harm the grass of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree, but only the men who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
5 And it was granted to them not to kill them but to torment them for five months, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.
6 And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them.

7 Now the appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle, and on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.
8 And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like lions' teeth.
9 And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots with horses rushing into battle.
10 And they have tails like scorpions, and stingers, and in their tails is their power to hurt men for five months.
11 They have as king over them the angel of the abyss—his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.

12 The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still coming after this.

13 Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God
14 saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”
15 And the four angels who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind.
16 The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand—I heard the number of them.
17 And this is how I saw the horses in the vision and those who sat on them: they had breastplates the color of fire and of hyacinth and of sulfur, and the heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and sulfur.
18 A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues—by the fire and the smoke and the sulfur that came out of their mouths.
19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they cause harm.

20 And the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons and the idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk.
21 And they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts.


Chapter 10

1 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire.
2 And he had in his hand a little scroll that was open. And he set his right foot on the sea and his left on the land,
3 and he cried out with a loud voice, like the roar of a lion. And when he cried out, the seven thunders spoke with their voices.
4 And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders said, and do not write it down.”

5 And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven
6 and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there would be no more delay.
7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound his trumpet, then the mystery of God is completed, just as He announced to His servants the prophets.

8 And the voice that I heard from heaven was speaking with me again and said, “Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”
9 So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little scroll. And he said to me, “Take and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.”
10 And I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.
11 And they said to me, “You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.”


Chapter 11

1 Then a measuring rod like a staff was given to me, saying, “Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it.
2 But exclude the court that is outside the temple; do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.
3 And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.”

4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
5 And if anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and consumes their enemies; and if anyone wants to harm them, in this way he must be killed.
6 They have authority to shut the sky so that no rain falls during the days of their prophesying, and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.

7 And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war against them and overcome them and kill them.
8 And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which symbolically is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
9 And those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will gaze at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and they will not allow their dead bodies to be placed in a tomb.
10 And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry, and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets had tormented those who dwell on the earth.

11 But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them.
12 And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here,” and they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.
13 And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell, and seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.

14 The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.

15 Then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying,
“The kingdom of the world has become
the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ,
and He will reign forever and ever.”

16 And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
17 saying,
“We give thanks to You, Lord God Almighty,
who is and who was,
because You have taken Your great power
and begun to reign.

18 And the nations were enraged,
but Your wrath came,
and the time for the dead to be judged,
and to reward Your servants the prophets
and the saints, and those who fear Your name,
both small and great,
and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”

19 Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.


Chapter 12

1 And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
2 And she was pregnant and cried out in labor and in pain to give birth.

3 Then another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems.
4 And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.
5 And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to shepherd all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.
6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, so that there they may nourish her for one thousand two hundred sixty days.

7 And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels fought back,
8 but he was not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.
9 And the great dragon was thrown down—the ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying,
“Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God
and the authority of His Christ have come,
for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down,
he who accuses them before our God day and night.

11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
and by the word of their testimony,
and they did not love their lives even unto death.
12 Therefore rejoice, O heavens and those who dwell in them!
But woe to the earth and the sea,
for the devil has come down to you in great wrath,
knowing that he has only a short time.”

13 And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
14 And the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she could fly to the wilderness, to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, away from the face of the serpent.
15 And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood.
16 But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth.
17 And the dragon was enraged with the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus.


Chapter 13

1 And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns ten diadems, and on its heads names of blasphemy.
2 And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, and its feet were like those of a bear, and its mouth was like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority.
3 One of its heads appeared to be slain to death, but its deadly wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed and followed after the beast.
4 And they worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war against it?”

5 And a mouth was given to it speaking great things and blasphemies, and it was given authority to act for forty-two months.
6 And it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle—that is, those who dwell in heaven.
7 And it was granted to make war against the saints and to conquer them, and authority was given to it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
8 And all who dwell on the earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain.
9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear:
10 If anyone is for captivity, into captivity he goes;
if anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword he must be killed.
Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.

11 Then I saw another beast rising up from the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb, and it spoke like a dragon.
12 And it exercises all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and it causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed.
13 And it performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to the earth before men.
14 And it deceives those who dwell on the earth by the signs that it was given to perform on behalf of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image for the beast who had the wound by the sword and yet lived.
15 And it was granted to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might speak and cause whoever would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.

16 And it causes all—the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave—to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,
17 so that no one can buy or sell except the one who has the mark—the name of the beast or the number of its name.
18 Here is wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred sixty-six.


Chapter 14

1 Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him were one hundred forty-four thousand who had His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.
2 And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps.
3 And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders, and no one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth.

4 These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
5 And in their mouth no lie was found—they are blameless.

6 And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,
7 and he said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come, and worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of water.”

8 And another, a second angel, followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality.”

9 And another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
10 he also will drink the wine of the wrath of God, poured undiluted into the cup of His anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
11 And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night—those who worship the beast and its image and whoever receives the mark of its name.”

12 Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow after them.”

14 Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.
15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying in a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud, “Put in Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.”
16 So the one seated on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.

17 And another angel came out of the temple that is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
18 Then another angel came out from the altar, who had authority over fire, and he called out in a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.”
19 So the angel swung his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
20 And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress as high as the horses’ bridles, for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.


Chapter 15

1 Then I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven: seven angels having seven plagues—the last ones—for with them the wrath of God is completed.
2 And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name were standing beside the sea of glass, having harps of God.
3 And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,
“Great and marvelous are Your works,
Lord God Almighty!
Righteous and true are Your ways,
King of the nations!

4 Who will not fear, O Lord,
and glorify Your name?
For You alone are holy.
All the nations will come and worship before You,
for Your righteous acts have been revealed.”

5 After these things I looked, and the temple of the tent of testimony in heaven was opened,
6 and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in pure, bright linen and wearing golden sashes around their chests.
7 Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever.
8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.


Chapter 16

1 Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God onto the earth.”
2 So the first went and poured out his bowl onto the earth, and harmful and painful sores broke out upon the men who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped its image.

3 The second poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man, and every living creature in the sea died.

4 The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.
5 And I heard the angel of the waters saying,
“You are righteous, the One who is and who was,
O Holy One, because You judged these things;
6 for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets,
and You have given them blood to drink—
they are worthy of it.”
7 And I heard the altar saying,
“Yes, Lord God Almighty,
true and righteous are Your judgments.”

8 The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch men with fire.
9 And men were scorched with intense heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has authority over these plagues, and they did not repent to give Him glory.

10 The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was darkened, and they gnawed their tongues because of pain.
11 And they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and they did not repent of their deeds.

12 The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east.
13 And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits like frogs.
14 For they are spirits of demons performing signs, who go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them for battle on the great day of God Almighty.
15 “Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his garments, so that he will not go about naked and they will not see his shame.”
16 And they gathered them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.

17 The seventh poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came from the temple, from the throne, saying, “It is done.”
18 And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder, and there was a great earthquake—an earthquake so great, that such has not occurred since man was on the earth.
19 And the great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the wrath of His fury.
20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
21 And great hailstones, about a talent in weight, came down from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for the plague is extremely severe.


Chapter 17

1 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,
2 with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell on the earth became drunk with the wine of her immorality.”

3 And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
4 And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality.
5 And on her forehead was written a name, a mystery:
“Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and of the abominations of the earth.”
6 And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw her, I was greatly astonished.

7 And the angel said to me, “Why are you astonished? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.
8 The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will marvel when they see the beast, because it was and is not and will come.
9 Here is the mind that has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits,
10 and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes, he must remain a little while.
11 And the beast that was and is not—he himself is an eighth and is of the seven, and he goes to destruction.

12 And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.
13 These are of one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
14 These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings—and those with Him are called and chosen and faithful.”

15 And he said to me, “The waters that you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.
16 And the ten horns that you saw, and the beast—these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
17 For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His purpose by being of one mind and giving their kingdom to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled.
18 And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which has dominion over the kings of the earth.”


Chapter 18

1 After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illuminated with his glory.
2 And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying,
“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!
She has become a dwelling place of demons,
a haunt for every unclean spirit,
a haunt for every unclean bird,
a haunt for every unclean and detestable beast.

3 For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.”

4 Then I heard another voice from heaven, saying,
“Come out from her, my people,
so that you do not participate in her sins,
and so that you do not receive her plagues;
5 for her sins have reached up to heaven,
and God has remembered her iniquities.

6 Pay her back as she also paid back,
and double for her double according to her deeds;
in the cup that she mixed, mix double for her.
7 As much as she glorified herself and lived in luxury,
give her that much torment and mourning,
because she says in her heart,
‘I sit as a queen and am no widow,
and I will never see mourning.’

8 For this reason her plagues will come in a single day—death and mourning and famine—and she will be burned up with fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.”

9 And the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning.
10 They will stand far off, in fear of her torment, saying,
“Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon the strong city!
For in a single hour your judgment has come.”

11 And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo any longer—
12 cargo of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls,
fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet,
all kinds of citron wood, all kinds of ivory articles,
all kinds of articles of costly wood and bronze and iron and marble,
13 cinnamon and spice and incense, myrrh and frankincense,
wine and olive oil, fine flour and wheat,
cattle and sheep, horses and chariots,
and slaves—that is, human souls.

14 And the fruit your soul desired has departed from you,
and all your luxurious and splendid things are lost to you;
they will never be found again.

15 The merchants of these things, who grew rich from her, will stand far off in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,
16 saying,
“Woe, woe, the great city,
clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet,
adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!
17 For in a single hour such great wealth has been laid waste.”

And every shipmaster and everyone who sails to a place, and sailors and as many as make their living by the sea, stood far off
18 and were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, “What city is like the great city?”
19 And they threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying,
“Woe, woe, the great city,
by which all who had ships at sea became rich from her wealth,
for in a single hour she has been laid waste.”

20 Rejoice over her, O heaven,
and you saints and apostles and prophets,
because God has pronounced judgment for you against her.

21 Then one mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,
“So will Babylon the great city be thrown down with violence,
and it will never be found again.

22 And the sound of harpists and musicians,
flute players and trumpeters
will never be heard in you again,
and no craftsman of any craft
will ever be found in you again,
and the sound of the mill
will never be heard in you again.

23 And the light of a lamp
will never shine in you again,
and the voice of bridegroom and bride
will never be heard in you again;
for your merchants were the great ones of the earth,
and by your sorcery all the nations were deceived.
24 And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints,
and of all who have been slain on the earth.”


Chapter 19

1 After these things I heard something like the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying,
“Hallelujah!
Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,
2 because His judgments are true and just;
for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her immorality,
and He has avenged the blood of His servants from her hand.”

3 And a second time they said,
“Hallelujah!
Her smoke goes up forever and ever.”
4 And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying,
“Amen. Hallelujah!”
5 And a voice came from the throne, saying,
“Praise our God, all you His servants,
and you who fear Him, small and great.”

6 And I heard something like the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying,
“Hallelujah!
For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.
7 Let us rejoice and be glad and give Him the glory,
because the marriage of the Lamb has come,
and His bride has made herself ready.”
8 And it was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and pure;
for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.

9 And he said to me, “Write: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.”
10 Then I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”

11 Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war.
12 His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written which no one knows except Himself.
13 And He is clothed in a garment dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.
14 And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses.
15 And from His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.
16 And on His garment and on His thigh He has a name written: “King of kings and Lord of lords.”

17 Then I saw one angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in midheaven, “Come, gather for the great supper of God,
18 so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of military commanders and the flesh of the mighty and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, small and great.”

19 And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against Him who sits on the horse and against His army.
20 And the beast was seized, and with it the false prophet who performed the signs in its presence by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image; these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
21 And the rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of Him who sits on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.


Chapter 20

1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key of the abyss and a great chain.
2 And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,
3 and threw him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were finished. After these things he must be released for a short time.

4 Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom authority to judge was given. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received the mark on their foreheads and on their hands. And they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
6 Blessed and holy is the one who has a share in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.

7 And when the thousand years are finished, Satan will be released from his prison
8 and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle. Their number is like the sand of the sea.
9 And they went up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them.
10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet also are, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

11 Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled, and no place was found for them.
12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged from what was written in the books, according to their deeds.
13 And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and the grave gave up the dead that were in them, and they were judged, each one according to his deeds.
14 Then death and the grave were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death—the lake of fire.
15 And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.


Chapter 21

1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.
2 And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying,
“Behold, the dwelling of God is with man,
and He will dwell with them,
and they will be His people,
and God Himself will be with them as their God.
4 And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes,
and death shall be no more,
nor shall there be mourning or crying or pain anymore,
for the former things have passed away.”

5 And the One seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” He also said, “Write, for these words are trustworthy and true.”
6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the one who thirsts I will give from the spring of the water of life without cost.
7 The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be My son.
8 But as for the cowardly and unbelieving and detestable, and murderers and the sexually immoral and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars—their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”

9 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven final plagues came and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”
10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,
11 having the glory of God—its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.
12 It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.
13 On the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.
14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15 And the one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city and its gates and its wall.
16 And the city lies foursquare; its length is the same as its width. And he measured the city with the rod: twelve thousand stadia; its length and width and height are equal.
17 He also measured its wall: 144 cubits by human measurement, which is also an angel’s.
18 The wall was built of jasper, and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.
19 The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of precious stone: the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,
20 the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.
21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls—each of the gates made of a single pearl—and the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.

22 And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb.
23 And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.
24 By its light the nations will walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.
25 And its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there.
26 They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.
27 But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.


Chapter 22

1 Then he showed me a river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
2 through the middle of the street of the city. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
3 There will no longer be any curse, and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and His servants will serve Him.
4 They will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.
5 And there will be no night there, and they will have no need of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will give them light, and they will reign forever and ever.

6 And he said to me, “These words are faithful and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show His servants what must soon take place.”
7 “Behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”

8 I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me.
9 But he said to me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!”

10 And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.
11 Let the one who is unrighteous still do unrighteousness, and let the filthy still be filthy, and let the righteous still do righteousness, and let the holy still be holy.”

12 “Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to each one as his work deserves.
13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”

14 Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates.
15 Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the sexually immoral and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

16 “I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”

17 The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say, “Come!” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life freely.

18 I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book,
19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book.

20 He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming quickly.”
Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!

21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all.
